This recognition is significant as it highlights the special relationship between Jacob and Joseph, who was favored among his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>). The robe, a symbol of this favoritism, was a long-sleeved garment that set Joseph apart. The act of recognizing the robe also underscores the deceit of Joseph's brothers, who used it to convince their father of Joseph's supposed death.<p><b>and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe!</b><br>Jacob's exclamation reveals his deep emotional connection to Joseph. The robe, a gift from Jacob, was a tangible representation of his love and preference for Joseph. This favoritism had previously fueled the jealousy and hatred of Joseph's brothers, leading to their betrayal. The robe's identification is a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Jacob's profound grief and the unfolding of God's providential plan.<p><b>A vicious animal has devoured him.</b><br>Jacob's conclusion that a wild animal killed Joseph reflects the common dangers of the ancient Near Eastern landscape, where predators were a real threat to livestock and people. This assumption is based on the evidence presented by the brothers, who dipped the robe in goat's blood to deceive their father. The imagery of a wild beast devouring Joseph foreshadows the trials and tribulations Joseph will face in Egypt, yet also points to God's sovereignty in using these events for a greater purpose.<p><b>Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's declaration of Joseph's fate is filled with despair and finality. The phrase "torn to pieces" evokes a violent and tragic end, which mirrors the emotional turmoil Jacob experiences. This moment of perceived loss is a turning point in the narrative, as it propels the story forward into Joseph's journey in Egypt. The imagery of being "torn" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was metaphorically "torn" for the sins of humanity. Joseph's story, like Christ's, is one of suffering leading to eventual redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, father of Joseph, who is deceived by his sons into believing that Joseph has been killed by a wild animal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who is sold into slavery by his brothers but is believed by his father to be dead.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>They conspire against Joseph out of jealousy and deceive their father by presenting Joseph's bloodied robe.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dothan.htm">Dothan</a></b><br>The place where Joseph was sent by his father to check on his brothers and where he was subsequently sold into slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_robe.htm">The Robe</a></b><br>A symbol of Jacob's favoritism towards Joseph, which becomes a tool of deception when presented with blood to Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deception can lead to long-lasting pain and suffering, as seen in Jacob's mourning for Joseph.

The moment mirrors earlier familial recognition scenes&#8212;Isaac mis-recognized Jacob in <a href="/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>, but here Jacob&#8217;s eyesight and memory serve him clearly, underscoring the reliability of the account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;It is my son&#8217;s robe!"</b><p>&#8226; The torn, blood-soaked robe shatters Jacob&#8217;s world; what once symbolized favor now signifies loss.<p>&#8226; By declaring &#8220;my son&#8217;s,&#8221; Jacob personalizes the tragedy, expressing ownership of both the gift and the grief (<a href="/genesis/42-13.htm">Genesis 42:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This affirmation sets the stage for years of mourning, echoing later laments over lost children such as David&#8217;s cry over Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A vicious animal has devoured him.</b><p>&#8226; Without evidence to the contrary, Jacob accepts the explanation the brothers had plotted earlier (<a href="/genesis/37-20.htm">Genesis 37:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows wild beasts as real dangers in ancient Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34&#8211;37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s conclusion demonstrates how persuasive tangible &#8220;proof&#8221; can be, even when it masks deception (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew style piles intensity&#8212;Jacob is convinced of a violent, final end (<a href="/genesis/44-28.htm">Genesis 44:28</a>).<p>&#8226; His declaration anticipates prolonged mourning that will color the narrative until the family is reunited (<a href="/genesis/46-30.htm">Genesis 46:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Job, who assumed disaster had ended his children&#8217;s lives (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18&#8211;20</a>), Jacob voices a grief that feels irreversible, though God is working behind the scenes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/37-33.htm">Genesis 37:33</a> records Jacob&#8217;s immediate, earnest response to the sight of Joseph&#8217;s bloodied robe. He accurately identifies the garment, interprets the evidence before him, and concludes that his beloved son has died a brutal death. While Jacob&#8217;s assessment is sincere, the reader knows the robe is part of a deceitful plan by Joseph&#8217;s brothers. The verse therefore highlights the tragic power of false evidence, the depth of a father&#8217;s love, and the unfolding providence of God that will ultimately turn sorrow into salvation for the entire family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast</span> (vide ver. 20) <span class="cmt_word">hath devoured him</span> (this was precisely what his sons meant him to infer); <span class="cmt_word">Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, the inf. abs.
