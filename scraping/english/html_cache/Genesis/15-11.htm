The presence of these birds in the narrative signifies a threat to the covenant ceremony that Abram is conducting. This imagery can be connected to the spiritual warfare that believers face, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where spiritual forces oppose God's plans. The carcasses represent the sacrificial animals Abram laid out as part of a covenant ritual, a common practice in ancient times to seal agreements. This act foreshadows the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law and ultimately points to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of God's covenant with humanity.<p><b>but Abram drove them away</b><br>Abram's action of driving away the birds demonstrates his active participation in safeguarding the covenant process. This reflects the believer's role in maintaining faith and resisting spiritual opposition, as encouraged in <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." Abram's vigilance is a testament to his faith and commitment to God's promises. This act also prefigures the protective role of Christ, who intercedes for believers and ensures the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>. Abram's determination to protect the covenant ceremony underscores the importance of perseverance in faith and the active role believers must take in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is later renamed Abraham by God.
