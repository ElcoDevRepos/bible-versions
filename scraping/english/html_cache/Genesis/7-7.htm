Noah, a righteous man in a corrupt generation, is accompanied by his immediate family. This reflects the biblical principle of household salvation seen in <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>, where the faith of one can lead to the salvation of the family. The inclusion of Noah's wife, sons, and their wives emphasizes the importance of family in God's plan and the continuation of humanity post-flood. It also underscores the concept of covenant, as God made a covenant with Noah and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/9-9.htm">Genesis 9:9</a>).<p><b>entered the ark</b><br>The act of entering the ark signifies obedience to God's command. The ark itself is a type of Christ, providing salvation and refuge from judgment. Just as Noah and his family were saved by entering the ark, believers are saved by being "in Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The ark, made of gopher wood and sealed with pitch, symbolizes the atoning work of Christ, who covers and protects believers from the wrath of God. The entry into the ark marks a transition from the old world to a new beginning, paralleling the believer's transition from the old life to new life in Christ.<p><b>to escape the waters of the flood</b><br>The floodwaters represent God's judgment on a sinful world, as described in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>. The flood is both a literal historical event and a foreshadowing of future judgment, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-6.htm">2 Peter 3:6-7</a>, where the world is reserved for fire. The escape from the floodwaters is a picture of salvation, where God provides a way of escape from His righteous judgment. This also connects to the theme of baptism in <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>, where the floodwaters symbolize the cleansing and new life that comes through faith in Christ. The flood narrative serves as a reminder of God's justice and mercy, offering salvation to those who trust and obey Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve human and animal life.
