This act of running can be seen as a demonstration of faith and obedience, reminiscent of the diligence expected of believers in their spiritual walk. The servant's initiative parallels the proactive nature of God's servants throughout Scripture, such as Elijah running before Ahab's chariot (<a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament parable of the prodigal son, where the father runs to meet his returning son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), symbolizing God's eagerness to welcome those who seek Him.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Please let me have a little water from your jar.&#8221;</b><br>The request for water is significant in the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, where hospitality was a highly valued virtue. Water, a precious resource in the arid regions, symbolizes life and sustenance. The servant's polite request demonstrates humility and respect, qualities that are esteemed in biblical teachings. This encounter at the well is reminiscent of other significant biblical meetings, such as Jacob meeting Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-10.htm">Genesis 29:10</a>) and Moses meeting Zipporah (<a href="/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16-21</a>). Wells often serve as settings for divine appointments and covenantal relationships. The servant's request can also be seen as a test of Rebekah's character, revealing her kindness and willingness to serve, qualities that align with the biblical ideal of a virtuous woman (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>). This moment foreshadows Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well (<a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7-26</a>), where He offers the living water of eternal life, drawing a parallel between physical and spiritual sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This is Abraham's servant, traditionally understood to be Eliezer of Damascus, tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.
