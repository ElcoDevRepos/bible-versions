Joseph, once sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt, becoming second only to Pharaoh. His position allowed him to store grain during seven years of plenty, as revealed to him through Pharaoh's dreams, which Joseph interpreted with divine insight. The phrase "every nation" indicates the widespread impact of the famine, suggesting that it affected not only Egypt but also surrounding regions. This scenario foreshadows the universal need for salvation and provision, which Christians see fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often typified by Joseph as a savior figure. The gathering of nations to Egypt also prefigures the gathering of all peoples to Christ.<p><b>because the famine was severe over all the earth</b><br>The severity of the famine underscores the dire circumstances that led nations to seek help from Egypt. Historically, famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, often caused by droughts or other natural disasters. The phrase "over all the earth" may be understood as hyperbolic, emphasizing the extensive reach of the famine rather than a literal global event. This widespread crisis sets the stage for God's providential care through Joseph, who becomes a vessel of God's provision. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to use difficult circumstances for His purposes. The famine also serves as a backdrop for the eventual reunion and reconciliation of Joseph with his family, which is a pivotal moment in the narrative of Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
