This is significant as it marks one of the few instances where God directly communicates with a woman in the Old Testament. The act of naming God is profound, indicating a personal revelation and relationship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, naming was an act of authority and understanding, suggesting Hagar's deep recognition of God's nature. This encounter occurs near a spring on the way to Shur, a region that connects Canaan to Egypt, highlighting Hagar's journey back to her homeland.<p><b>&#8220;You are the God who sees me,&#8221;</b><br>Hagar's declaration reveals a personal and intimate understanding of God's character. The Hebrew term "El Roi" is used here, meaning "God who sees." This is the only instance in the Bible where this specific name for God is used, emphasizing His omniscience and care. In the broader biblical narrative, God's ability to see and know individuals is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a> and <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>. This acknowledgment by Hagar underscores God's attention to the marginalized and oppressed, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>for she said, &#8220;Here I have seen the One who sees me!&#8221;</b><br>Hagar's experience is transformative, as she realizes she has encountered the divine. This moment is reminiscent of other theophanies in the Bible, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>) and Jacob wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). The phrase suggests a mutual recognition between God and Hagar, highlighting the personal nature of God's interactions with humanity. This encounter foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who is described as the visible image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>) and who sees and knows the hearts of all people (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48-49</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai (later Sarah), who becomes the mother of Ishmael.

Scripture often equates this Messenger with the LORD Himself (compare <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming is significant all through Genesis&#8212;Adam naming the animals (<a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>) and places later being named for divine encounters, such as &#8220;The LORD Is My Banner&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>) or &#8220;The LORD Is Peace&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-24.htm">Judges 6:24</a>). Hagar joins that pattern, showing that the one true God is not limited to Abraham&#8217;s immediate family line.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;who had spoken to her&#8221; underlines that God is not distant. He initiates, speaks, and reveals Himself to individuals in real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You are the God who sees me,&#8221;</b><p>&#8220; You are the God who sees me&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hagar declares that the LORD&#8217;s vision is both all-knowing and compassionate.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-3</a> affirms, &#8220;You know when I sit and when I rise&#8230; You are familiar with all my ways.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a> echoes God&#8217;s words to Moses: &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people in Egypt.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Truths wrapped up in her confession:<p>&#8211; God notices the marginalized (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52-53</a>).<p>&#8211; His seeing is personal and caring, not merely observational (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).<p>&#8211; Because He sees, He acts&#8212;He promised Hagar a future for Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Hagar&#8217;s words give believers today confidence that no circumstance, pain, or exile is hidden from God&#8217;s view (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for she said, &#8220;Here I have seen the One who sees me!&#8221;</b><p>&#8220; for she said, &#8216;Here I have seen the One who sees me!&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Hagar marvels that she, a servant on the run, has encountered God and lived (compare <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>; <a href="/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The location becomes Beer-lahai-roi, &#8220;well of the Living One who sees me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>), a lasting memorial to God&#8217;s presence in the desert wilderness.<p>&#8226; Encounter leads to obedience: Hagar returns to Sarah as directed (<a href="/genesis/16-9.htm">Genesis 16:9</a>), trusting the God who both sees and is seen.<p>&#8226; This meeting foreshadows later theophanies where God reveals Himself to sustain His people in crisis (<a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9-13</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a> records the first person in Scripture to name God with a title born out of personal experience: &#8220;the God who sees me.&#8221; Hagar&#8217;s testimony teaches that the Lord genuinely observes, cares, and intervenes in the lives of the overlooked. He speaks into real moments of distress, reveals Himself, and turns wilderness into places of fellowship.
