In the context of the Song of Solomon, this can be seen as a representation of the love between Christ and the Church. The call signifies an invitation to a deeper relationship, echoing the call of Christ to His followers in passages like <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, where Jesus invites those who are weary to come to Him for rest. The beloved's voice is one of authority and love, reminiscent of <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>, where Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."<p><b>Arise, my darling</b><br>The command to "arise" suggests a call to action or a change in state. It can be seen as an invitation to leave behind the old life and embrace a new one, similar to the call of Christ to rise from spiritual slumber (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>). The term "darling" indicates a deep affection and chosen status, reflecting the special relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a treasured possession.<p><b>Come away with me</b><br>This invitation to "come away" implies a journey or a transition to a new place or state of being. It suggests leaving behind distractions and focusing on the beloved, akin to the call of Jesus to His disciples to leave everything and follow Him (<a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17-18</a>). The phrase can also be seen as a call to intimacy and seclusion with God, reminiscent of the wilderness experiences where God often met with His people, such as Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>).<p><b>my beautiful one</b><br>The term "beautiful one" signifies the beloved's worth and value in the eyes of the caller. It reflects the transformative power of love, where the beloved is seen as beautiful and cherished. This mirrors the way Christ views the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, where the Church is presented as a radiant bride, without stain or wrinkle. The beauty here is not just physical but also spiritual, indicating purity and holiness bestowed by the relationship with the beloved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the Song of Solomon, the beloved is often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of Christ in allegorical readings. He is the one who speaks tenderly to his love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_darling.htm">The Darling</a></b><br>The darling, or the Shulammite woman, represents the bride or the church in allegorical interpretations. She is the recipient of the beloved's affection and invitation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>The Song of Solomon is set in a pastoral and romantic landscape, often interpreted as a metaphor for the intimate relationship between God and His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invitation.htm">The Invitation</a></b><br>The event described is an invitation to rise and come away, symbolizing a call to deeper relationship and communion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_season.htm">The Season</a></b><br>The context of the passage suggests a change in season, often seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and awakening.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_intimacy.htm">The Call to Intimacy</a></b><br>Just as the beloved calls the darling to arise and come away, God calls us to a deeper, more intimate relationship with Him. This requires us to leave behind distractions and focus on His voice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_invitation.htm">Responding to God's Invitation</a></b><br>The passage encourages believers to respond to God's invitation with eagerness and readiness. It is a reminder to prioritize our spiritual journey and relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_renewal.htm">Spiritual Renewal</a></b><br>The change in season signifies a time for spiritual renewal and growth. Believers are encouraged to embrace new beginnings and allow God to transform their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_beauty_of_the_church.htm">The Beauty of the Church</a></b><br>The beloved's description of the darling as "beautiful" reflects how God sees His church. It is a reminder of our identity in Christ and the beauty of being part of His body.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_expectation.htm">Living in Expectation</a></b><br>The invitation to "come away" suggests living with an expectation of God's presence and work in our lives. It challenges us to be attentive and responsive to His leading.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_2_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_2_10_Christ_s_call.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:10 illustrate Christ's call to His Church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Arise_my_darling_show_God_s_love.htm">What does "Arise, my darling" reveal about God's desire for relationship with us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_heed_God_s_call_daily.htm">How can we respond to God's call to "come away" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_passages_echo_Song_2_10_invitation.htm">Which New Testament passages echo the invitation found in Song of Solomon 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Song_2_10_on_spiritual_growth.htm">How does understanding Song of Solomon 2:10 deepen our spiritual walk with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Arise_my_darling_in_Song_2_10.htm">What is the significance of "Arise, my darling" in Song of Solomon 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Song_2_10_show_God_s_love.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:10 reflect God's love for His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Song_2_10.htm">What historical context influences the interpretation of Song of Solomon 2:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_song_of_solomon_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Song of Solomon 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_knowing_someone_romantically.htm">What defines knowing someone in a romantic context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_themes_are_in_song_of_solomon.htm">What themes are explored in the Song of Solomon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_song_2's_romance_conflict_with_bible_themes.htm">Does the romantic language throughout Song of Solomon 2 conflict with traditional interpretations of divine or covenantal themes elsewhere in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_is_'leaping'_in_song_2_8-9_explained.htm">In Song of Solomon 2:8-9, how can we reconcile the depiction of the lover 'leaping' over mountains with literal geography or biology?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Song of Solomon 2:10 Mean</div><b>My beloved calls to me</b><p>&#8226; In the literal setting, the groom is taking the initiative, showing that love begins with his voice and not her striving.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, our Lord does the same. &#8220;The sheep listen for His voice&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3&#8211;4</a>), and &#8220;We love because He first loved us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is personal. As surely as Solomon singled out the Shulamite, Jesus singles out each believer; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> portrays Him standing at the door and knocking for individual fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Arise</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Arise&#8221; breaks inertia. It is a summons to leave winter behind (Songs 2:11-13) and step into a new season.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a> urges, &#8220;Arise, shine, for your light has come,&#8221; while <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a> echoes, &#8220;Wake up, sleeper&#8230; and Christ will shine on you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Like Levi who &#8220;got up and followed&#8221; when Jesus said, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27-28</a>), the bride is to rise at once, trusting the Caller.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my darling</b><p>&#8226; The word breathes tenderness. The groom esteems her; there is no hint of performance-based acceptance.<p>&#8226; God says, &#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), and He &#8220;rejoices over you with singing&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Such affection secures identity. Knowing we are called &#8220;beloved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a>) frees us to respond without fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come away with me</b><p>&#8226; Not merely &#8220;come,&#8221; but &#8220;come away.&#8221; The path involves separation from distractions toward deeper intimacy.<p>&#8226; Jesus told weary disciples, &#8220;Come with Me by yourselves to a quiet place&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>). <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a> invites, &#8220;Let us go to Him outside the camp,&#8221; leaving worldly approval behind.<p>&#8226; Movement with the Bridegroom leads to maturity. Paul pressed on &#8220;to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my beautiful one</b><p>&#8226; The groom delights in her beauty, even though she once called herself &#8220;dark&#8221; (Songs 1:5). Love has transformed her gaze and his declaration confirms it.<p>&#8226; Christ will &#8220;present to Himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> celebrates robes of righteousness that replace shame, while <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> affirms we are new creations in Him. Beauty is bestowed, not earned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/2-10.htm">Song of Solomon 2:10</a> pictures a loving voice initiating, awakening, affirming, inviting, and beautifying. The bridegroom&#8217;s words are both a literal expression of romantic pursuit and a vivid portrait of Christ&#8217;s pursuit of His people. He calls, &#8220;Arise,&#8221; lifting us from complacency; He names us &#8220;darling,&#8221; settling our worth; He says, &#8220;Come away,&#8221; drawing us into deeper fellowship; and He pronounces us &#8220;beautiful,&#8221; clothing us in His own righteousness. The verse, taken at face value, assures every believer that the Lord&#8217;s love is active, personal, and transforming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</span> The word "spake" Conveys the meaning in answer to a person appearing, but not necessarily in answer to a voice heard. We most suppose that Shulamith recognized her beloved, and made some sign that she was near, or looked forth from the window. As the soul responds, it is more and more invited; the voice of the Bridegroom is heard calling the object of his love by name, "I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine" (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
