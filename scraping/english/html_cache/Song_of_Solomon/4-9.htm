The term "sister" is a term of endearment, common in ancient Near Eastern love poetry, signifying closeness and familial affection. The dual reference to "sister" and "bride" emphasizes both the purity and the covenantal nature of their relationship. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a reflection of the relationship between Christ and the Church, where the Church is both the beloved and the bride of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The capturing of the heart signifies a complete and overwhelming love, akin to the love God has for His people.<p><b>you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes,</b><br>The imagery of the eyes is significant in biblical literature, often representing insight, understanding, and the soul's window. The power of a single glance suggests the profound impact and connection between the lovers. In a spiritual sense, this can be likened to the transformative power of a believer's faith and devotion, which captures the heart of God. The eyes are also symbolic of purity and sincerity, qualities that are cherished in a covenant relationship.<p><b>with one jewel of your neck.</b><br>Jewelry in ancient times was a symbol of beauty, wealth, and status. The mention of a jewel on the neck highlights the beloved's beauty and the value placed upon her by the lover. In a spiritual allegory, this can be seen as the adornment of the Church with righteousness and grace, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the New Jerusalem is adorned as a bride. The neck, often associated with will and submission, suggests a willing and graceful submission to love, paralleling the Church's submission to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, traditionally understood to be Solomon, expressing his deep affection and admiration for his bride.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The recipient of the speaker's affection, often interpreted as a representation of the church or the individual believer in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the Song of Solomon is set in a context that often alludes to the city, symbolizing a place of love and divine presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding.htm">The Wedding</a></b><br>The broader context of the Song of Solomon includes themes of marriage and union, reflecting both literal and allegorical interpretations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_necklace.htm">The Necklace</a></b><br>A symbol of beauty and adornment, representing the bride's allure and the intimate connection between the lovers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_love.htm">The Power of Love</a></b><br>The verse highlights the transformative power of love, capturing the heart and evoking deep emotional responses.

Love willingly yields, just as Christ &#8220;gave Himself up&#8221; for His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds every married couple that genuine love is more than emotion; it is a glad handing over of self for the good of the other (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My sister</b><p>Calling her &#8220;sister&#8221; speaks of cherished family closeness and purity.<p>&#8226; In Near Eastern culture, a nobleman might affectionately call his wife &#8220;sister&#8221; to underscore companionship rather than mere possession (see <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, believers share a similar bond with the Lord&#8212;He is &#8220;not ashamed to call them brothers&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>), inviting them into intimate fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My bride</b><p>Now the groom affirms their covenant relationship.<p>&#8226; Marriage is God&#8217;s ordained context for such passion (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The dual titles&#8212;sister and bride&#8212;beautifully balance tenderness and commitment, just as Christ&#8217;s love for the church is both affectionate and covenantal (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stolen my heart</b><p>Repetition drives the point home: her effect on him is overpowering.<p>&#8226; Love&#8217;s intensity can feel almost illicit in its surprise, yet within marriage it is wholly righteous (<a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Husbands are reminded to voice appreciation often; words have power to rekindle devotion (Songs 1:15; <a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One glance</b><p>A single look from her eyes is enough to disarm him.<p>&#8226; Eyes in Scripture often symbolize the window to the soul (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord likewise regards His people with delight when they turn their gaze toward Him in faith (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One jewel</b><p>Even a modest necklace magnifies her beauty in his eyes.<p>&#8226; External adornment here merely accents the inward loveliness he already sees (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Small gestures&#8212;an accessory, a smile, a kind word&#8212;can carry great weight in sustaining marital joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a> celebrates the breathtaking power of covenant love. The groom&#8217;s repeated declarations reveal a heart joyfully captivated by his bride&#8217;s presence, purity, and beauty. Their relationship models both familial closeness and marital commitment, pointing ultimately to the deeper reality of Christ&#8217;s passionate, possessive, and pure love for His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Ravished.</span>--Marg., <span class= "ital">taken away, </span>whereas many (including Herder, Ewald, &c) give an exactly opposite sense: "thou hast given me heart, emboldened me."

His heart has been caught, the poet playfully says, by the neck-chain. Tennyson's<p>"Thy rose lips and full-blown eyes<p>Take the heart from out my breast,"<p>gives the feeling of the passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</span> The bridegroom still continues his address of love, which we must not, of course, press too closely, though it is noticeable that the language becomes somewhat more sober in tone, as though the writer were conscious of the higher application to which it would be put. Some translators take the first clause as though the word "ravished" should be rendered "emboldened." Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, literally, "heartened," may mean, as in Aramaic, "make courageous." Love in the beginning overpowers, <span class="accented">unhearts</span>, but the general idea must be that of "smitten" or "captured." So the LXX., Venetian, and Jerome, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vulnerasti cor meum</span> (cf. <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>). <span class="accented">My sister, my bride</span>, is, of course, the same as "my sisterly bride," a step beyond "my betrothed." Gesenius thinks that "one of thine eyes" should be "one look of thine;" but may it not refer to the eye appearing through the veil, as again one chain of the neck may glitter and attract all the more that the whole ornamentation did not appear in view? If but a portion of her beauty so overpowers, what will be the effect of the whole blaze of her perfection? As the Church advances in her likeness to her Lord, she becomes more and more the object of his delight, and as the soul receives more and more grace, so is her fellowship with Christ more and more assured and joyful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You have captured my heart,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lib&#183;ba&#7687;&#183;ti&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - second person feminine singular &#124;
