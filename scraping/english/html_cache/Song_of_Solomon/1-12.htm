The "king" here is often interpreted as Solomon, known for his wisdom and wealth. The table signifies a place of fellowship and intimacy, possibly during a banquet or feast. In ancient Near Eastern culture, dining with someone was a sign of close relationship and trust. This setting can also be seen as a type of Christ, who invites believers to His table, symbolizing communion and fellowship with Him (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p><b>my perfume spread its fragrance</b><br>Perfume in biblical times was a luxury item, often made from costly spices and oils. The spreading of fragrance symbolizes the influence and presence of the beloved. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as the believer's life being a pleasing aroma to God, as referenced in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>, where believers are described as the fragrance of Christ. The act of spreading fragrance can also be seen as an act of worship, similar to Mary anointing Jesus with costly perfume in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>, symbolizing devotion and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>In the context of the Song of Solomon, the king is often understood to be Solomon himself.

Historically, that is King Solomon, the bride&#8217;s beloved (Songs 1:4). Spiritually, every earthly kingly image points upward to the greater King, who &#8220;is King of kings and Lord of lords&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). The bride&#8217;s first thought is not her own beauty but the honor of being near her king, echoing <a href="/psalms/45-11.htm">Psalm 45:11</a>: &#8220;The king is enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was at His Table</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;was at his table&#8230;&#8221; describes intimate fellowship. A royal table is a place of feasting, security, and shared joy, much like Mephibosheth eating &#8220;always at the king&#8217;s table&#8221; in <a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a> and the believer promised a place to &#8220;eat and drink at My table in My kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>). For the couple, the table scene shows relaxed delight in each other; for the redeemed, it foreshadows the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<p>Bullet points to notice:<p>&#8226; Setting&#8212;private, not public, emphasizing closeness.<p>&#8226; Provision&#8212;everything needed is supplied by the king.<p>&#8226; Celebration&#8212;gladness replaces fear in the king&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My Perfume</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;my perfume&#8230;&#8221; is personal and costly. Nard, the likely scent, was treasured, as in <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> and <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> where similar perfume was lavishly poured on Jesus. It symbolizes the believer&#8217;s devotion&#8212;something prepared in advance, not improvised. <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a> says, &#8220;For we are to God the fragrance of Christ.&#8221; Like the bride, each follower carries an aroma formed by love, obedience, and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spread Its Fragrance</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;spread its fragrance.&#8221; Perfume does its work silently yet unmistakably. Nearness to the king causes the scent to waft; warmth releases aroma. When Christ is at the center, the fragrance of a surrendered life fills the room (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).<p>Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Fragrance reaches others without words&#8212;our actions and attitudes testify.<p>&#8226; The aroma lingers&#8212;lasting influence after the moment passes (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> notes the house &#8220;was filled with the fragrance&#8221;).<p>&#8226; True fragrance originates from the heart&#8212;external appearances cannot fake the smell of genuine devotion (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a> pictures the bride enjoying intimate fellowship with her king; her treasured perfume naturally fills the air. Literally, it is a moment of marital delight. Spiritually, it points to believers who, seated at the King&#8217;s table, let the costly fragrance of devotion flow. Near the King, our lives become a pleasing aroma to Him and a testimony to everyone around us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">While the king sitteth.</span>--There is no need to imagine a scene where the monarch, having failed in his attempt to allure the shepherdess by fine offers, retires to his banquet, leaving her to console herself with the thoughts of her absent shepherd love.

The perfume is prepared by drying the shaggy stem of the plant (see Tristram's <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>pp. 484, 485). There is a sketch of the plant in Smith's <span class= "ital">Bibl.

My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts. My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi.</span> The preterite is best taken poetically for the present. The words are evidently a response to those of the king. As such they refer to present feeling and not to a past state. The bride expresses her delight in the king. The table is used generally. The Hebrew word is from a root "to sit round." The habit of reclining at table was introduced much later, during the Persian, Greek, and Roman period. The spikenard was a powerful perfume, probably of Indian origin, as the Indian word <span class="accented">nalada</span>, meaning "that which yields fragrance," shows. The Persian is <span class="accented">nard</span>, the Old Arabic <span class="accented">nardu</span>. It was made from an Indian plant, the <span class="accented">Valeriana</span>, called <span class="accented">Nardo-stachys</span> '<span class="accented">Gatamansi</span>, growing in Northern and Eastern India. The hairy part of the stem immediately above the root yields the perfume. That it was "very precious" we see from the account of Mary's offering, which was worth more than three hundred denarii, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> &pound;8 10s. (<a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>; <a href="/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2</a>). Horace promised Virgil a whole cask, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nine gallons, of the best wine in exchange for a small onyx box full of the perfume. The metaphor represents the intense longing of love. <span class="accented">Myrrh</span> was an exotic introduced into Palestine from Arabia, Abyssinia, and India. Like frankincense, it is one of the amyridae. The <span class="accented">Balsamodendron myrrha</span> is the tree itself with its leaves and flowers. From the tree came a resin or gum (<span class="accented">Gummi myrrhae</span>), which either dropped from the leaves or was artificially obtained by incisions in the bark. The natural product was the more valuable. It was much prized as a perfume, and employed for many purposes. The Hebrew women were accustomed to carry little bags or bottles of myrrh suspended from their necks and hanging down between the breasts under the dress, diffusing an attractive fragrance round them. The word <span class="accented">tseror</span> is, properly, "a little bag," <span class="accented">sacculus</span>, "that which one ties up," rather than a "bundle." The meaning, of course, is rhetorical - He is at my heart and delightful to all my thoughts as the fragrance to my senses. The henna flowers, or cypress, in the vineyards of Engedi, is a very beautiful figure. <span class="accented">Copher</span>, the cypress cluster, - in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in Arabic, <span class="accented">al-henna</span> (<span class="accented">Lawsonia</span>) - grows in Palestine and Egypt, as we are told by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.' 12:24). It is a tall shrub reaching to eight or ten feet, exceedingly beautiful in appearance, and giving forth a delightful odour. It is named from a root "to be white or yellow-white." The Moslem women stain their hands and feet with it to give them a yellow tint. Engedi was a lovely district on the west of the Dead Sea - Hazezon Tamar, now <span class="accented">Ain Tidy</span>, where Solomon made terraces on the hillsides and covered them with gardens and vineyards. The allusion confirms the date of the writing as contemporary with Solomon, as the gardens would then be in their perfection. The figure is, perhaps, intended to be an advance in rhetorical force upon that which preceded - the fragrance diffused and almost overpowering, as of a blossoming tree. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative, Article &#124;
