Their presence in the Song of Solomon highlights the setting of a walled city, likely Jerusalem, which was known for its protective walls and gates. The watchmen symbolize authority and societal norms. In the context of the Song, the watchmen's encounter with the Shulammite woman can be seen as an obstacle in her pursuit of love, reflecting the challenges and misunderstandings that can occur in relationships. This phrase also echoes the vigilance required in spiritual life, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>, where watchmen are depicted as those who pray and intercede for Jerusalem.<p><b>They beat me and bruised me;</b><br>The physical abuse described here is symbolic of the trials and sufferings that can accompany the pursuit of love and truth. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for the persecution and hardships faced by believers. The imagery of being beaten and bruised is reminiscent of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which Christians interpret as a prophecy of Jesus Christ's suffering. This connection underscores the theme of sacrificial love and the cost of true devotion.<p><b>they took away my cloak,</b><br>The cloak, or outer garment, was an important piece of clothing in biblical times, often symbolizing identity and protection. The removal of the cloak by the watchmen can represent vulnerability and exposure, both physically and emotionally. In a spiritual sense, it may signify the stripping away of one's defenses or the loss of dignity. This act can be compared to the stripping of Jesus' garments before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28</a>), highlighting themes of humiliation and sacrifice.<p><b>those guardians of the walls.</b><br>The guardians of the walls were tasked with protecting the city, yet here they are depicted as aggressors. This paradox highlights the complexity of human institutions and the potential for those in authority to misuse their power. In a spiritual context, it serves as a reminder that earthly guardians can fail, but God remains the ultimate protector. The walls themselves can symbolize separation and division, as well as security and belonging, reflecting the dual nature of boundaries in relationships and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watchmen.htm">The Watchmen</a></b><br>These are the guards or sentinels who patrol the city.

Spiritually, it reflects moments when believers, while earnestly seeking Christ, meet misunderstanding, mistreatment, or persecution&#8212;even from those expected to help. Such trials expose our need for the Bridegroom&#8217;s unfailing protection and drive us to depend on His righteousness rather than any human institution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The watchmen.</span>--See Note on <a href="/songs/3-3.htm" title="The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw you him whom my soul loves?">Song of Solomon 3:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Veil.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">redid; </span>LXX. <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span><span class= "ital">. </span>Probably a light summer dress for throwing over the person on going out in a hurry, like the <span class= "ital">tsaiph </span>put on by Rebecca (<a href="/genesis/24-65.htm" title="For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.">Genesis 24:65</a>). Only elsewhere in <a href="/isaiah/3-23.htm" title="The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.">Isaiah 3:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span> The intention is to show into what evil she fell by having to seek her beloved instead of being with him. She is mistaken and misjudged; she is smitten and wounded with reproaches and false accusations, as though she were a guilty and evil minded woman. She is subjected to abuse and ill treatment from those who should be her guardians. She had hard work to escape, leaving her robe behind her (cf. <a href="/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a>). The <span class="accented">redhidh</span>, like <span class="accented">ridha</span> in Arabic, is a plaid-like upper garment thrown over the shoulders - so says Aben Ezra; but it is derived, no doubt, from the root "to make broad or thin," to spread out - perhaps, therefore, "a thin, light upper robe" which was worn over the chiton, a summer overdress, a cloak (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Jerome, <span class="accented">pallium</span>; Luther, <span class="accented">Schleier</span>). If we take the dream thus described, and which seems to conclude at this point, as related to the surrounding ladies, then we must suppose that it is introduced for the sake of what follows. The bride feels that she does not love her beloved one half enough; she is so conscious of deficiencies, that she might even have acted as her dream represented. It had entered her soul and made her ill with inward grief and self-reproach. She might so act, she might so treat her husband. So she adjures her companions to tell him how much she loves him. The spiritual application is not difficult to see. When the soul loses its joy in Christ, it becomes the prey of fears and self accusations, and even of reproaches from Christ's servants and the guardians of his Church. For when our religion ceases to be a spontaneous delight to us, we are apt to carry on even the active work of our life in a manner to be misunderstood by sincere believers around us. Yea, the very efforts we make to recover peace may bring reproach upon us. Any Christian minister who has had to deal with religious despondency will quite understand this dream of the bride's. We may often smite and wound, and even deprive of the garment of reputation and esteem, those who are really seeking for Christ, because we have misunderstood them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I encountered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1467;&#1447;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#8217;u&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural &#124;
