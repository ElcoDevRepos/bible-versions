Marble was a prized material in the ancient Near East, known for its durability and beauty. The imagery of legs as pillars suggests a foundation that is both strong and enduring, symbolizing the steadfastness and reliability of the beloved. In a broader biblical context, pillars often represent support and strength, as seen in the pillars of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>). This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the unshakeable foundation of the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>).<p><b>set on bases of pure gold</b><br>Gold in the Bible is frequently associated with purity, value, and divinity. The bases of pure gold suggest a foundation that is not only strong but also precious and pure. This imagery can be connected to the divine nature of Christ, who is both the foundation and the precious cornerstone of the faith (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6</a>). The use of gold also reflects the wealth and splendor of Solomon's reign, as gold was abundant in his kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-23</a>).<p><b>His appearance is like Lebanon</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its majestic mountains and the famous cedars, which were highly valued for their quality and strength. The comparison to Lebanon suggests a sense of grandeur and awe-inspiring beauty. In biblical times, Lebanon's cedars were used in the construction of significant buildings, including Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). This connection highlights the beloved's impressive and noble presence, akin to the natural beauty and strength of Lebanon.<p><b>as majestic as the cedars</b><br>Cedars of Lebanon were symbols of majesty and strength, often used in Scripture to denote something of great stature and enduring quality (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>). The comparison to cedars underscores the beloved's impressive and commanding presence. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a reflection of Christ's majesty and eternal kingship, as He is often depicted as the ultimate fulfillment of strength and beauty in the Scriptures (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>). The cedars' enduring nature also points to the eternal and unchanging nature of Christ's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, often interpreted as a representation of King Solomon or, allegorically, as Christ in Christian theology.
