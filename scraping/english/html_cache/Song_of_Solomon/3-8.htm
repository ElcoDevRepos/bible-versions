In ancient Israel, being skilled with the sword was essential for defense and protection. The sword is often a symbol of strength and authority in the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where the "sword of the Spirit" is mentioned. The emphasis on skill suggests a disciplined and well-trained group, reflecting the importance of preparedness in spiritual warfare.<p><b>Experienced in warfare</b><br>The mention of experience in warfare indicates that these men are seasoned soldiers, not novices. This experience would have been crucial in the ancient Near Eastern context, where conflicts and battles were common. The historical context of Israel, surrounded by hostile nations, necessitated a strong military presence. This experience can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual maturity and the ability to withstand trials, as echoed in <a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a>, where believers are encouraged to endure hardship as good soldiers of Christ.<p><b>Each has his sword at his side</b><br>The image of each warrior having his sword at his side signifies readiness and vigilance. In biblical times, carrying a sword was a sign of being prepared for immediate action. This readiness is paralleled in the New Testament, where believers are urged to be watchful and prepared for spiritual battles (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The sword at the side also symbolizes the personal responsibility each believer has in their spiritual journey.<p><b>Prepared for the terror of the night</b><br>Nighttime in ancient times was often associated with danger and uncertainty, as it was when attacks or robberies were more likely to occur. The phrase "terror of the night" can be linked to <a href="/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a>, which speaks of God's protection from the "terror of night." This preparation reflects the need for constant vigilance and trust in God's protection against spiritual and physical threats. It also points to the assurance that, like these warriors, believers are equipped to face the darkness with confidence in God's provision and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watchmen.htm">The Watchmen</a></b><br>These are the individuals described as skilled with the sword and experienced in warfare.

Other passages describe similar expertise: &#8220;Some Gadites defected to David&#8230; mighty men of valor, trained for battle, &#8230; their faces were the faces of lions&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). <a href="/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a> adds, &#8220;Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior; appear in your majesty and splendor&#8221;. Skill with the sword reminds believers today that devotion to God&#8217;s Word&#8212;the &#8220;sword of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>)&#8212;requires practice and discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>experienced in warfare</b><p>The verse continues, highlighting that these men are &#8220;experienced in warfare.&#8221; They have faced real conflict and survived. Similar language is used of David&#8217;s mighty men (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8&#8211;17</a>) and of soldiers Saul describes as &#8220;warriors from youth&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33</a>). This experience points to reliability; they know how to defend their king. In the Christian life, spiritual veterans&#8212;those who have endured trials&#8212;encourage the rest of the body (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3&#8211;4</a>) and model steadfast faith (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each has his sword at his side</b><p>Readiness is emphasized: &#8220;Each has his sword at his side.&#8221; Nehemiah recorded the same posture when rebuilding Jerusalem&#8217;s wall: &#8220;And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-18.htm">Nehemiah 4:18</a>). The weapon stays within reach, not stored away for emergencies alone. The image challenges believers to keep God&#8217;s Word close&#8212;memorized, pondered, and applied&#8212;so that truth is immediately available when temptation or discouragement strikes (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>prepared for the terror of the night</b><p>Nighttime carried special dangers&#8212;bandits, surprise attacks, or wild animals.

Yet human vigilance still matters: &#8220;Be sober-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). Living in a darkened world, believers imitate these watchmen by staying spiritually awake (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35&#8211;36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/3-8.htm">Song of Solomon 3:8</a> paints a vivid scene of well-trained, battle-tested warriors guarding their king&#8212;swords mastered, worn, and ready, eyes open through the darkest hours. The verse encourages every follower of Christ to cultivate similar readiness with the Word, proven faith through trials, and vigilant watchfulness against threats that prowl in the night.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Because of fear</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>because of the alarms common at night.

The journey from Shunem to Jerusalem would be about fifty miles in a direct course, and it was therefore necessary to pass at least one, if not two, nights on the way; the course being through a wild and solitary region. The Church of God may be often called to pass through dangers and enemies, but he that loveth her will provide against her destruction - she shall have rest in the love cf. her Lord. He will surround her with his strength.
