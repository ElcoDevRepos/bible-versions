Sheep were a vital part of agrarian life, symbolizing purity and value. Newly shorn sheep would appear clean and white, suggesting the bride's teeth are perfectly white and well-maintained. This imagery reflects the importance of personal care and beauty in the cultural context of the time. The comparison to sheep also implies a sense of order and uniformity, as a flock moves together cohesively.<p><b>coming up from the washing;</b><br>The act of washing sheep was a necessary part of maintaining their health and the quality of their wool. This imagery suggests freshness and purity, as the sheep would be clean and bright after washing. In a biblical context, washing often symbolizes purification and renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks to be washed and made whiter than snow. This reflects the spiritual purity and renewal that is valued in the relationship between the bride and groom, and by extension, between Christ and the Church.<p><b>each has its twin,</b><br>The mention of each tooth having its twin emphasizes symmetry and completeness. In ancient times, dental health was a sign of overall well-being and attractiveness. This imagery suggests that the bride is in perfect health and beauty, with no imperfections. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for the completeness and harmony found in a godly relationship, where each partner complements the other, much like the Church is the body of Christ, complete and unified.<p><b>and not one of them is lost.</b><br>This phrase underscores the idea of wholeness and preservation. In a historical context, losing teeth was common due to the lack of modern dental care, so having a full set of teeth was noteworthy. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for God's preservation of His people, as seen in <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>, where Jesus speaks of losing none of those given to Him by the Father. It reflects the security and care found in a covenant relationship, whether in marriage or between Christ and His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of the Song of Solomon, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom and wealth.

Likewise, the bride&#8217;s teeth are spotless&#8212;no stain of compromise.<p>&#8226; Washing points to moral and ceremonial cleansing.

The only other place where it is found is <a href="/2_kings/6-6.htm" title="And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.">2Kings 6:6</a>, where it is used of <span class= "ital">cutting wood.</span><p><span class= "bld">Bear twins.</span>--The Hebrew word means "to make double." But this may either be "to produce twins," as in the text, or "to make pairs," or "to occur in pairs," a rendering which gives far better sense. The perfect and regular rows of teeth are exactly paired, upper to lower, like the sheep coming two and two from the washing, not one being bereaved of its fellow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them.</span> The simile is very apt and beautiful Thy teeth are perfectly smooth, regular, and white; the upper set corresponding exactly to the lower set, like twin births in which there is no break (cf. <a href="/songs/6-6.htm">Song of Solomon 6:6</a>). The moisture of the <span class="accented">saliva dentium</span>, heightening the glance of the teeth, is frequently mentioned in love songs. The whiteness of wool is often used as a comparison (see <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; Book of Enoch 46:1). Some think that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. should not be rendered "newly shorn," but "periodically shorn" (see Ginsburg) - a poetical epithet for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The newly shorn would be washed first, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, "to be double,....to be pairs," in the hiph. is "to make double," "to make pairs," "to appear paired." Perhaps the reference is to the sheep being washed in pairs, and going up side by side from the water. This would seem almost more exact than the idea of twin lambs, because the difference in size between the ewe and the lamb would suggest irregularity. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, "deprived," "bereaved" (<a href="/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>), may point merely to the loneliness of the single sheep going up by itself, suggesting one tooth without its fellow. Ginsburg says, "all of which are paired." Each keeps to its mate as they come up from the pool. This is a decided improvement on the Authorized Version. But the figure is clear with either rendering, and is very striking and suggestive of the pleasant country life to which the bride was accustomed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your teeth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;in&#183;na&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124;
