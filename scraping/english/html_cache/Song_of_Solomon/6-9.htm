The term "dove" is often used in Scripture to symbolize innocence and beauty (<a href="/songs/2-14.htm">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>). The beloved is described as "perfect," indicating moral and spiritual completeness. The uniqueness of the beloved can be seen as a type of the Church, which is set apart and cherished by Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The imagery of a dove also connects to the Holy Spirit, who descended like a dove at Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>), symbolizing peace and purity.<p><b>the favorite of the mother who bore her</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the beloved's favored status, suggesting a special relationship and affection. In the cultural context, being the favorite child often implied receiving a special inheritance or blessing, as seen in the stories of Isaac and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28, 27</a>:6-29). The mention of the mother may also symbolize the nurturing and protective aspects of God's love for His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-13.htm">Isaiah 66:13</a>.<p><b>The maidens see her and call her blessed</b><br>The maidens' recognition of the beloved's blessedness reflects the admiration and respect she commands. This can be paralleled with the Church's witness to the world, where believers are called to be a light and a testimony (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>). The term "blessed" echoes the Beatitudes, where those who embody the values of the Kingdom are called blessed (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>).<p><b>the queens and concubines sing her praises</b><br>The mention of queens and concubines highlights the beloved's surpassing beauty and virtue, even among those of high status. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the universal recognition of Christ's bride, the Church, in the eschatological fulfillment of God's kingdom (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). The praise sung by queens and concubines may also reflect the acknowledgment of God's chosen people by the nations, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved (My Dove, My Perfect One)</a></b><br>This refers to the Shulammite woman, who is the central female figure in the Song of Solomon.

Taken literally, it celebrates the exclusive, passionate fidelity of marriage. Viewed through the bigger biblical lens, it foreshadows Christ&#8217;s unique, perfected, and publicly honored Church. The verse invites believers to rest secure in the Bridegroom&#8217;s unwavering love and to live lives so radiant that others cannot help but recognize the blessing of belonging to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">My dove . . . is but one.</span>--"While the monarch's loves are so many, <span class= "ital">one </span>is mine, my dove, my perfect one: <span class= "ital">one, </span>the delight of her mother, the darling of her who bore her." It is impossible not to see in this a eulogy on monogamy, which, in practice, seems always to have been the rule among the Jews, the exceptions lying only with kings and the very rich. The eulogy is made more pronounced by putting an unconscious testimony to the superiority of monogamy into the mouths of the "queens and concubines," who praise and bless this pattern of a perfect wife.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but my dove,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
