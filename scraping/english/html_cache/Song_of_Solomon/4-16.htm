The north wind was often cold and harsh, while the south wind was warm and gentle. This invocation of both winds symbolizes a desire for a full and balanced experience, suggesting a readiness for growth and change. Biblically, winds can represent the movement of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>), indicating a spiritual awakening or renewal. The call for the winds to awaken may also reflect a longing for divine intervention and blessing.<p><b>Breathe on my garden and spread the fragrance of its spices.</b><br>The garden is a metaphor for the beloved's body or the intimate relationship between the lovers. In biblical times, gardens were places of beauty, fertility, and sustenance, often enclosed for protection and privacy. The request for the winds to breathe on the garden implies a desire for the relationship to flourish and for its virtues to be known. The spreading of fragrance suggests the influence and testimony of a godly life, reminiscent of the "fragrance of Christ" mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>. The spices may symbolize the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), indicating a life enriched by divine qualities.<p><b>Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choicest fruits.</b><br>This phrase reflects an invitation for intimacy and communion. The beloved is invited to partake in the fruits of the garden, symbolizing the mutual enjoyment and fulfillment found in a committed relationship. In a spiritual sense, this can be seen as an invitation for Christ to dwell within the believer, enjoying the fruits of a life dedicated to Him. The imagery of tasting the choicest fruits echoes the biblical theme of God delighting in the obedience and devotion of His people (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>). The garden, being referred to as "his," emphasizes the idea of belonging and stewardship, aligning with the biblical concept of believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who is expressing her desire for her beloved.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The bridegroom, often seen as King Solomon, representing the object of the bride's affection and desire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden.htm">The Garden</a></b><br>Symbolic of the bride's own self, her love, and her purity, which she offers to her beloved.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/north_wind_and_south_wind.htm">North Wind and South Wind</a></b><br>Representing different influences or experiences that can enhance the growth and spread of the garden's fragrance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fragrance.htm">Fragrance</a></b><br>Symbolic of the bride's virtues and the beauty of her love, which she wishes to share with her beloved.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_invitation_of_the_spirit.htm">The Invitation of the Spirit</a></b><br>Just as the bride invites the winds to blow upon her garden, believers are to invite the Holy Spirit to work in their lives, cultivating spiritual growth and spreading the fragrance of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_virtues.htm">Cultivating Virtues</a></b><br>The garden represents the virtues and character that believers are to develop.

She longs for the purifying north wind and the nurturing south wind, asks the Spirit to broadcast the fragrance of a consecrated life, and eagerly invites her beloved to enjoy the garden He has planted. Literally, it celebrates married love; prophetically, it describes believers who surrender to Christ&#8217;s refining work, bear His aroma, and offer Him the fruit of lives wholly His.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Blow upon my garden.</span>--After the description of his beloved's charms under these figures, the poet, under a companion figure, invokes the "airs of love" to blow upon the garden, that its perfumes may "flow out" for him--that the object of his affections may no longer keep herself reserved and denied to him. Tennyson's melodious lines are recalled which describe how, when a breeze of morning moves,<p>"The woodbine spices are wafted abroad,<p>And the musk of the roses blown."<p><span class= "bld">Let my beloved </span>. . .--This should form a separate verse, being the reply made to the appeal in the first part of the verse. The maiden yields to her lover's suit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits.</span> This is the answer of the bride to the lavish praises of her husband. I am all his. She is yet unworthy of the king and of his love until the seasonal changes have developed and unfolded and spread forth her excellences. The north represents cold; the south, heat. Let the various influences from different quarters flow gently over the garden and call forth the fragrance and the fruits (cf. <a href="/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>). There is rich suggestion in such words. Whether we think of the individual soul or of the Church of Christ, the true desire of those who delight in the love of the Saviour is that all the gifts and graces which can be bestowed may make them worthy of him who condescends to call his people his delight. Surely it is no mere romantic idyll that is before us. Such significance cannot be a mere coincidence when it is so transparent and so apt. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Awaken,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#363;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O north wind,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1508;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6828.htm">Strong's 6828: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hidden, dark, the north as a, quarter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and come,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
