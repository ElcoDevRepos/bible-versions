A wall was essential for the defense of a city, representing security and integrity. In this verse, the metaphor of a wall may refer to a young woman's chastity and moral fortitude. The imagery suggests that if the woman is steadfast and virtuous, she is like a wall that stands firm against external pressures. This aligns with biblical teachings on purity and the importance of maintaining one's moral boundaries, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>, which describes the virtues of a noble woman.<p><b>we will build a tower of silver upon her</b><br>Silver in the Bible often symbolizes redemption and value. Building a "tower of silver" upon the wall suggests enhancing and honoring the woman's virtue and strength. Towers were used for watchfulness and added protection, indicating that her virtue will be celebrated and safeguarded. This can be seen as a promise of reward and honor for maintaining purity, akin to the rewards of wisdom and righteousness described in <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>. The use of silver also points to the preciousness of her character, reminiscent of the bride of Christ, the Church, being adorned and valued (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>If she is a door</b><br>A "door" in biblical terms often represents access, openness, and vulnerability. Unlike a wall, a door can be opened or closed, suggesting a level of choice or susceptibility. In this context, the metaphor may imply a young woman who is more open or less guarded in her interactions. The imagery of a door can also relate to opportunities and decisions, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Christ stands at the door and knocks, symbolizing the invitation to relationship and choice.<p><b>we will enclose her with panels of cedar</b><br>Cedar wood is known for its durability and pleasant aroma, often used in the construction of temples and palaces, such as Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). Enclosing a door with panels of cedar suggests providing protection and strength to someone who may be more vulnerable. This act of enclosing can be seen as a commitment to safeguard and preserve the integrity of the individual. The use of cedar implies a transformation from vulnerability to strength, much like the protective and sanctifying work of Christ in the believer's life (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The primary female character in the Song of Solomon, often interpreted as representing the church or the individual believer in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lover.htm">The Lover</a></b><br>The male counterpart, often seen as a representation of Christ or God&#8217;s love for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>Symbolic of strength, purity, and steadfastness.

The picture is of a young woman whose purity and resolve are intact, much like the &#8220;righteous who are as bold as a lion&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>) and the one who &#8220;possesses his own vessel in honor&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Brothers (or guardians) promise to &#8220;build a tower of silver&#8221; on such steadfastness. Silver, repeatedly linked with purity and value (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-20.htm">Proverbs 10:20</a>), shows that moral strength deserves honor, encouragement, and even public esteem. A tower adds height and watchfulness, echoing the call to &#8220;stand firm&#8221; in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The meaning: when a young believer proves immovable in chastity, those who love her gladly reinforce her virtue&#8212;rewarding it, celebrating it, and giving her even greater protection and dignity for the future (cf. <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If she is a door</b><p>&#8220;If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.&#8221; &#8212; Songs 8:9b<p>&#8226; A door opens and closes; it can grant access too easily.

This reflects the charge to &#8220;flee youthful passions&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>) and the wisdom of guarding &#8220;the doorway of my lips&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>). The aim is restoration to the steadfastness of a wall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/8-9.htm">Song of Solomon 8:9</a> shows loving guardians weighing a younger sister&#8217;s character and pledging whatever is needed to safeguard her purity. If she stands immovable, they honor and augment her virtue. If she proves vulnerable, they surround her with strong, gracious restraints. The verse upholds chastity, celebrates family responsibility, and models how God&#8217;s people can build each other up, &#8220;encouraging one another in love and good deeds&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">If she be a wall.</span>--The <span class= "ital">wall </span>and <span class= "ital">door </span>are emblems of chastity and its opposite. The <span class= "ital">palace of silver </span>some commentators explain by reference to the custom (among the Druses) of wearing an ornament like a horn on the head. But this is unlikely. The metaphors of the <span class= "ital">wall </span>and <span class= "ital">door </span>are naturally expanded. If the maiden grows up virtuous and inaccessible to seduction <span class= "ital">we will build upon her a palace of silver, i.e., </span>we will so provide for her in marriage that from her may spring an illustrious house; but if otherwise, <span class= "ital">we will enclose her with boards of cedar, i.e., </span>the strongest precautions shall be taken to guard her honour. This passage is one of the strongest arguments for the theory that chaste wedded love is the theme of this book, the poet going on in <a href="/songs/8-10.htm" title="I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.">Song of Solomon 8:10</a> to put into the heroine's mouth a protestation of purity; and by which virtuous disposition, even more than by her beauty, she had won her husband's love: "I have grown up to virtuous womanhood, and I have found favour in his eyes."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar</span>. The interpretation which Delitzsch suggests of these words is that the "wall" represents firmness of character, and the "door" weakness and insecurity. If she firmly and successfully withstands all immoral approaches, then we will bestow high honour upon her, as a tribute to her maidenly virtue and constancy. The turret or castle of silver would mean rewarding her with increase. Silver is the emblem of holiness, gold of nobility. The meaning may, however, merely be, "We will endow her with plenty." The boards of cedar are supposed to be special protections, as cedar is noted for its hardness and durability. But is not the meaning much simpler and more natural? It would be rather a far fetched use of the figure of a door that it should suggest seduction, and would be rather unsuitable in the lips of the bridegroom when speaking of the little sister of his own bride. May not the meaning be no more than this? - She may become one of the most substantial parts of the building, like a wall; in that ease all that she can be she shall be; we will put the highest honour upon her. She may be a door, that is, though not so great and substantial as the wall, still in the very front of the building and before the eyes of all. In that case we will beautify her with costly and fragrant adornment. The gate shall be enclosed in cedar wood. "The wall and the door," says Zockler, "are mostly understood of the steadfast and faithful keeping of the Word of God and of its zealous proclamation to the Gentiles (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, etc.); but some also explain them of the valiant in faith and the weak in faith, or of the learned and simple, or of faithful Christians and such as are recreant and easily accessible to the arts of seduction. And then, according to these various interpretations, the 'silver bulwarks' are now the miracles of the first witnesses of Jesus, now the distinguished teachers of the Church, now pious Christian rulers, now the testimonies of Holy Scripture by which faith is strengthened. And, again, by the 'cedar boards' are sometimes understood the ten commandments or the Law, sometimes Christian teachers, sometimes the examples of the saints, sometimes the salutary discipline of the cross and sufferings for Christ's sake," etc. All such attempts at detailed interpretation fail to give satisfaction. Their effect is to repel many from the study of the book altogether, just as the follies and. extravagances of the interpreters of prophecy have greatly hindered the study of the prophetic Scriptures. The <span class="accented">wall</span> and the <span class="accented">door</span> need not be taken as opposed to one another, as they are not in our conceptions of a city. They fulfil different functions. The <span class="accented">wall</span> is for <span class="accented">defence</span>; the door is for <span class="accented">admission.</span> In the one case we think of <span class="accented">strength</span>, and in the other case of <span class="accented">beauty.</span> The application of the symbols is very easy if the general meaning alone is regarded. There is a variety of capacity and function in the Church of Christ. There are differences in the forms of Christianity among different nations. But the Lord will receive and bless all. Some are not fitted to be built upon as strong wails, but they may still be beautiful examples of Christian graces in the eyes of the world, through whom many gladly enter into the truth and into the fellowship of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a wall,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2346.htm">Strong's 2346: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall of protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we will build</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7687;&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a tower</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#238;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2918.htm">Strong's 2918: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall, a fortress, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of silver</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to protect her.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;le&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
