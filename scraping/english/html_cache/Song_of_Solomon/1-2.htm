In the context of ancient Hebrew poetry, a kiss symbolizes affection, love, and a deep personal connection. The imagery of a kiss is often used in the Bible to denote a covenant or a significant relationship, as seen in the story of Jacob and Laban (<a href="/genesis/29-11.htm">Genesis 29:11</a>). The desire for a kiss here can be seen as a longing for a personal and intimate relationship with God, reflecting the believer's yearning for divine love and closeness. Theologically, this can be interpreted as a type of Christ's love for the Church, where the Church, as the bride, desires the intimate presence and love of Christ, the bridegroom.<p><b>For your love is more delightful than wine.</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a symbol of joy, celebration, and abundance. It was often used in religious ceremonies and feasts, as seen in the wedding at Cana (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>), where Jesus turned water into wine, symbolizing the new covenant and the joy of salvation. The comparison of love to wine suggests that the love being described is rich, intoxicating, and surpasses all earthly pleasures. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual joy and fulfillment found in a relationship with God, which surpasses all worldly delights. The love of God, as experienced through Christ, is portrayed as the ultimate source of joy and satisfaction, echoing the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/63-3.htm">Psalm 63:3</a>, "Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, traditionally understood to be the bride or beloved in the Song of Solomon.

The LXX., followed by the Vulg., read <span class= "ital">breasts </span>(probably <span class= "ital">dada&#8249; </span>instead of <span class= "ital">doda&#8249;</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>the origin of many fanciful interpretations: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>the two breasts = the two Testaments which breathe love, the first promising, the second revealing Christ. The reading is condemned by the obvious fact that the words are not spoken <span class= "ital">to </span>but <span class= "ital">by </span>a woman, the change of persons, from second to third, not implying a change of reference or speaker, but being an enallage frequent in sacred poetry.

MUTUAL LOVE. Song of Shulamith in the royal chambers. Chorus of ladies, daughters of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</span> Whether we take these words as put in the lips of the bride herself, or of the chorus as identifying themselves with her, is of little consequence. It is certain that the idea intended to be expressed is that of delight in the approach of the royal bridegroom. The future is used optatively, "Let me be taken up into the closest fellowship and embrace." All attempts to dispense with the amatory phraseology are vain. The "kisses" must be interpreted in a figurative sense, or the sacred character of the whole book must be removed. The words may be rendered, <span class="accented">with one of his kisses</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sweetness of his lips is such that one kiss would be rapture. Some have thought that allusion is intended to the custom among idolaters referred to in <a href="/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a>, "My mouth hath kissed my hand;" but the meaning is simply that of affection. The great majority of Christian commentators have regarded the words as expressive of desire towards God. Origen said, the Church of the old dispensation longing after higher revelations, as through the Incarnation, "How long shall he send me kisses by Moses and the prophets? I desire the touch of his own lips." It is dangerous to attempt specific applications of a metaphor. The general truth of it is all that need be admitted. If the relation between God and his people is one that can be set forth under the image of human affection, then there is no impropriety in the language of Solomon's Song. "To kiss a kiss" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is the ordinary Hebraic form (cf. "to counsel a counsel"). <span class="accented">Thy love is better than wine.</span> The plural is used, "loves," as in the word "life" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) - the abstract for the concrete, perhaps in order to indicate the manifestation of love in many caresses. The change from the third person to the second is common in poetry. The comparison with wine may be taken either as denoting sweetness or exhilarating effects. The intoxicating power of wine is but rarely referred to in Scripture, as the ordinary wine was distinguished from strong drink. Some, as Hitzig and Bottcher, would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, changing the pointing, and translating, "Let him give me to drink;" but there is no necessity for a reading so forced and vulgar. The Septuagint, altering the vowels of the word "love," turn it into "breasts," and must therefore have supposed it addressed to the bride. The word is connected with the Arabic, and runs through the languages, <span class="accented">dodh</span> (cf. Dada, Dido, David). Perhaps the reference to wine, as subsequently to the ointments, may be explained by the fact that the song is supposed to be sung while wine is presented in the chamber, and while the perfumes are poured out in preparation for the entrance of the royal bridegroom. We can scarcely doubt that the opening words are intended to be the utterance of loving desire on the part of the bride in the presence of the daughters of Jerusalem. Some have suggested that vers. 1-8 are from a kind of responsive dialogue, but the view of the older interpreters and of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Weissbach, and others of the moderns, seems more correct, that all the first seven verses are in the mouth of Shulamith, and then ver. 8 comes in naturally as a chorus in reply to the song of the bride. The use of the plural, "We will run after thee," etc., is easily explicable. The bride is surrounded by her admiring companions and attendants. They are congratulating her on the king's love. She speaks as from the midst of the company of ladies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let him kiss me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1433;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;q&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
