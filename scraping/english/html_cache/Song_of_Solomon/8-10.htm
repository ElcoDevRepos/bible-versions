In the context of the Song of Solomon, the speaker, likely the Shulammite woman, asserts her chastity and moral integrity. The imagery of a wall suggests protection and separation from impurity, aligning with biblical themes of holiness and sanctification (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/26.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>). Walls in ancient cities were crucial for defense, indicating the speaker's resolve to maintain her virtue. This metaphor can also be seen as a type of the Church, which is called to be set apart and holy (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<p><b>and my breasts are like towers</b><br>The comparison of breasts to towers conveys maturity and readiness for love, as well as dignity and honor. Towers in ancient times were symbols of strength and watchfulness, often used for protection and vigilance. This imagery may reflect the woman's confidence in her own worth and beauty, as well as her preparedness for a committed relationship. The use of towers can also be seen as a metaphor for the nurturing and protective aspects of love, akin to the nurturing nature of Christ's love for the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29</a>).<p><b>So I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace</b><br>This phrase indicates the fulfillment and contentment found in a loving relationship. The speaker's purity and maturity have led to a harmonious and peaceful union with her beloved. In biblical terms, peace (shalom) encompasses wholeness, well-being, and reconciliation. This can be seen as a reflection of the peace that Christ brings to believers, reconciling them to God (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>). The imagery of bringing peace also connects to the prophetic role of Christ as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who establishes a new covenant of love and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the bride or beloved in the Song of Solomon.

By guarding her heart, embracing God&#8217;s timing for physical intimacy, and entering covenant love, the bride becomes a source of deep rest and fulfillment to her husband&#8212;an earthly snapshot of the perfect peace the Lord designs for all who walk in His ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">I am a wall </span>. . .--The heroine interrupts with a protestation of her purity, and of her right to marry, being of age, and conscious of being beloved.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof: then was I in his eyes as one that found peace. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to brings a thousand pieces of silver. My vineyard, which is mine, is</span> <span class="cmt_word">before me: thou, O Solomon, shalt have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</span> The meaning seems to be affectionate approval of the method just described. Solomon says, "If the young sister be, worthy of love, she shall receive more and more of defence and honour; she shall be all that I can make her." The bride takes up this thought. "So it is with me, and, in the spirit of thankful acknowledgments and praise, I will respond to all the favour of the king. King Solomon has loved me, and now I am rising higher and becoming more and more glorious because of his love." The typical reference can scarcely be missed. The Church, the bride of the Lamb, shines only in the light of him whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life. The comparison to a city with the walls and towers, while it would seem a little far fetched in a love song, is quite in place if the typical intention was in the mind of the writer. He was thinking of the city of God, "beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth." "One that findeth peace" is the same as "one that findeth favour," that is, one who is the object of his affection. There are several references which confirm this, such as <a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-2.htm">Jeremiah 31:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>. The word "peace" (<span class="accented">shalom</span>) is in all probability purposely chosen in this case as a kind of play on the name <span class="accented">Solomon</span>, which appears immediately afterwards. "The king of peace delights in me because I am peace in his eyes." The Church is after the image of the King. His likeness in her makes her beautiful. Men take knowledge of Christians that they have been with Jesus (see <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). It is scarcely necessary to point out that this language of the bride is entirely against the shepherd theory. She could not have talked of finding peace in his eyes if she was torn from her true lover. The bride then goes on to express her devotedness to the king and her desire to bring forth abundance for him. She uses as an example, which perhaps was typical in her time and country, some remarkably fruitful vineyard of the king's. She will, in like manner, realize all his highest wishes. All that she has shall be his. The name Baal-hamon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>) in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. Judith 8:3), designates probably a place near to Sunem, somewhere to the north, on the further side of the Plain of Jezreeh The produce of the vineyard must have been very large, as every keeper was to bring in for himself a thousand shekels of silver. It is not stated how many keepers there were, but the word which is employed is not "servants," but "watchers, or overseers." A vineyard was divided into portions, with a certain definite prescribed number of vines in each portion. In <a href="/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a> we read, "And it shall come to pass in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings shall even be for briers and thorns." Now, a thousand silverlings was one shekel, so that if this passage can be taken as throwing light on what the bride says, it would imply that, instead of one shekel forevery thousand vines, every keeper brought a thousand shekels. That would seem impossible, so that the parallel can scarcely be strict. Perhaps the largeness of the vineyard is referred to, and each of the keepers would have many thousands of vines under his inspection. The general meaning, however, is not obscure. The vineyard was a celebrated one, and was taken as a typical instance of fertility and abundance. When the bride speaks of her vineyard which is before her, there may be an allusion to her previous manner of life as a rustic maiden employed in the vineyards, and to her own position as a keeper or as one of the family. But this is not intended to be prominently expressed. The whole spirit of the poem justifies the view that she is speaking of her person. She invited Solomon to rejoice in the beauty and fragrance of her garden, to pluck the fruits, to revel in the delights. Everything that is pleasant and lovely is before him (see <a href="/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>). <span class="accented">Before me</span>; that is, in my power is all this delight, and my desire is to my husband; all that I have is his. Like the far-famed keepers of Baal-hamon, I will give the king a thousand shekels, that is, the utmost that the vineyard can produce, and "those that keep the fruit thereof" shall have two hundred - perhaps meaning a hundred each, that is a tenth, which was the ancient tithe due to the priests. It may be, however, that a double tithe is intended. The king shall be satisfied, and all those who labour for the king shall be more than ever rewarded. If we take such words as typical, they point to a state of things in the history of the kingdom of God when the spiritual and the temporal shall be perfectly adjusted. The keepers of the vineyard have often made sad havoc of the vineyard itself because of their greedy discontent. The fruits which have been yielded by the Church have fallen very far short. The husbandmen have ill treated the Lord's servants. But all the judgments which have been poured out both upon ancient Jews and upon the corrupt Christendom of later times have been directed to one end, to make the vineyard of the Lord more fruitful, to remove the things which are offensive in his sight, to satisfy him whose soul travailed for his people; for herein is the Father glorified in the Son, when them who bear the name of the Beloved "bear much fruit." Then the keepers of the vineyard will themselves rejoice, not that they reap a larger harvest of this world's good, not "for filthy lucre's sake," but because their hearts are one with his whose vineyard they keep, and to see the fruit abound is to fill them with joy. Surely we shall recognize in such language an anticipation of the many allusions which are found both in the prophets and psalms and in the discourses of our Lord himself. "The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant" (<a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">am a wall</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2346.htm">Strong's 2346: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall of protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and my breasts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7695;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
