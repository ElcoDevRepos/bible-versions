The ripening of figs indicates the arrival of spring, a time of renewal and new beginnings. This imagery is used to convey a sense of readiness and anticipation. In the broader biblical context, the fig tree is sometimes associated with Israel itself (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/24.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-10</a>), symbolizing the nation's spiritual state. The ripening figs suggest a time of spiritual awakening and fruitfulness.<p><b>the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.</b><br>Vines and vineyards are frequently mentioned in the Bible, symbolizing abundance and joy. The fragrance of blossoming vines evokes a sense of beauty and delight, suggesting a time of celebration and love. This imagery is reminiscent of the blessings and abundance promised to God's people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-8</a>). The spreading fragrance can also be seen as a metaphor for the influence and reach of God's love and grace, as well as the spreading of the Gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>).<p><b>Arise, come away, my darling;</b><br>This phrase is an invitation to action and movement, suggesting a call to leave behind the old and embrace the new. It reflects the intimate and personal relationship between the speaker and the beloved, often interpreted as a representation of Christ's call to His Church or to individual believers. The call to "arise" is echoed in other scriptures where God calls His people to rise and follow Him (<a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>).<p><b>come away with me, my beautiful one.&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of the invitation emphasizes the urgency and importance of the call. The term "beautiful one" highlights the value and worth of the beloved, reflecting God's view of His people as precious and cherished. This mirrors the relationship between Christ and the Church, where believers are seen as the bride of Christ, adorned and made beautiful through His love and sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>). The call to "come away" suggests a journey or pilgrimage, a theme common in the Christian life as believers are called to follow Christ and leave behind worldly attachments (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of Christ, calling to his beloved.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite.htm">The Shulammite</a></b><br>The beloved being addressed, representing the bride or the church in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fig_tree.htm">Fig Tree</a></b><br>A symbol of prosperity and blessing, often used in the Bible to represent Israel or spiritual fruitfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vines.htm">Vines</a></b><br>Symbolic of growth and abundance, often associated with joy and celebration in biblical literature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/springtime_imagery.htm">Springtime Imagery</a></b><br>Represents renewal, new beginnings, and the awakening of love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_fruitfulness.htm">Spiritual Fruitfulness</a></b><br>Just as the fig tree ripens its figs, believers are called to bear spiritual fruit in their lives, reflecting the character and love of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_intimacy.htm">Invitation to Intimacy</a></b><br>The call to "arise, come away" is an invitation to deeper intimacy with Christ, encouraging believers to prioritize their relationship with Him above all else.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/season_of_renewal.htm">Season of Renewal</a></b><br>The imagery of springtime signifies a season of renewal and new beginnings, reminding believers of the continual renewal available through the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_timing.htm">Recognizing God's Timing</a></b><br>Understanding the signs of the times, as illustrated by the fig tree, encourages believers to be spiritually alert and responsive to God's timing in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/beauty_in_god's_creation.htm">Beauty in God's Creation</a></b><br>The beauty of the blossoming vines and the beloved reflects the beauty God sees in His creation and His people, encouraging believers to see themselves as God sees them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_2_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 2:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_2_13_on_God_s_timing.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:13 illustrate God's timing in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Fig_tree_ripening_believer_s_growth.htm">What does "the fig tree ripens its figs" symbolize in a believer's growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_respond_to_God_s_call_daily.htm">How can we "arise" and respond to God's call in our daily walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Song_2_13_John_15_5_bearing_fruit.htm">Connect Song of Solomon 2:13 to John 15:5 about bearing fruit.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Embracing_God_s_seasons_of_change.htm">How can we recognize and embrace God's seasons of change in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Fig_tree_s_role_in_Song_of_Solomon_2_13.htm">What is the significance of the fig tree in Song of Solomon 2:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_2_13_God_s_bond.htm">How does Song of Solomon 2:13 reflect God's relationship with His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_spring_imagery_key_in_Song_2_13.htm">Why is the imagery of springtime important in Song of Solomon 2:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_song_of_solomon_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Song of Solomon 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_'rounded_bowl'_navel_literal_or_hyperbole.htm">Song of Solomon 7:2 -

The line paints a literal picture of spring, yet it also hints at readiness&#8212;fruit is now mature, not merely budding.<p>&#8226; Figuratively, the maturing fig echoes the believer&#8217;s call to bear visible, tangible fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). Just as early figs prove the health of the tree, spiritual fruit proves genuine life within.<p>&#8226; The couple&#8217;s love has ripened too. Infatuation has grown into commitment; what was promised is now evident. God delights when love&#8212;marital and spiritual&#8212;moves from promise to produce (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The blossoming vines spread their fragrance</b><p>&#8220;The blossoming vines spread their fragrance.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Vine blossoms fill the air with a perfume that announces vintage time is near. The scene is saturated with promise&#8212;what is fragrant now will soon be wine that &#8220;gladdens the heart of man&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture links fragrance with joyful worship and witness. As vines scent the countryside, God&#8217;s people are &#8220;the aroma of Christ&#8221; in the world (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; For the couple, shared fragrance hints at mutual joy and the influence their covenant will have on family and community (<a href="/hosea/14-7.htm">Hosea 14:7</a>). Healthy marriages create a pleasant &#8220;scent&#8221; that blesses others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Arise, come away, my darling</b><p>&#8220;Arise, come away, my darling;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The invitation breaks any lingering inertia. It is time to move, to step into the season God has prepared. Similar language appears in Songs 2:10 and echoes God&#8217;s repeated call to His people&#8212;&#8220;Get up and go&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the risen Christ says, &#8220;Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>). He stirs hearts out of complacency into vibrant fellowship.<p>&#8226; In marriage, one spouse&#8217;s initiative can revive the other. Loving leadership encourages, never coerces. The phrase &#8220;my darling&#8221; (beloved) underscores safety and affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>come away with me, my beautiful one</b><p>&#8220;come away with me, my beautiful one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The repetition of &#8220;come away&#8221; adds urgency, while &#8220;my beautiful one&#8221; affirms worth. Beauty here is not cosmetic but relational&#8212;she is beautiful because she is loved (<a href="/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The line anticipates deeper union. Just as the Bridegroom will one day say, &#8220;Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>), Solomon invites his bride into shared life and joy.<p>&#8226; For believers, Christ&#8217;s call is intensely personal: &#8220;I know My own&#8230; they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). He sees His church as radiant, even while perfecting her (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Responding means leaving lesser pursuits to enjoy something better&#8212;intimate fellowship and purposeful mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 2:13 paints a springtime scene where figs are ripe and vines fragrant, then turns that scene into a summons. Nature&#8217;s readiness mirrors the lovers&#8217; relationship: fruit is mature, fragrance is spreading, so it is the right moment to rise and go forward together. On a larger canvas, the verse pictures Christ calling His people&#8212;fully loved, made beautiful in Him&#8212;to leave complacency and walk in fruitful, fragrant fellowship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The fig tree putteth forth her green figs.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">has ripened its unripe figs. </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">phag </span>(preserved in Bethphage);
