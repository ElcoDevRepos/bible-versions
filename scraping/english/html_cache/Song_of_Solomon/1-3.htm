The mention of fragrance here symbolizes the allure and attractiveness of the beloved. Perfumes were made from various natural ingredients, such as myrrh and frankincense, which were also used in temple worship, suggesting a connection between the beloved's appeal and spiritual devotion. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, whose presence is spiritually fragrant and pleasing to believers, as reflected in <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is described as a "fragrant offering."<p><b>your name is like perfume poured out.</b><br>In biblical times, a person's name was more than just an identifier; it represented their character and reputation. The comparison of the beloved's name to perfume suggests that their reputation is as pleasing and attractive as a delightful fragrance. This can be connected to the name of Jesus, which is exalted and revered, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-10</a>, where every knee bows at His name. The pouring out of perfume also evokes the image of anointing, which in the Old Testament was associated with consecration and blessing, pointing to the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>No wonder the maidens adore you.</b><br>The admiration of the maidens reflects the communal recognition of the beloved's virtues and attractiveness. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this admiration can be seen as a celebration of love and beauty. Spiritually, it can be interpreted as the collective adoration of the Church for Christ, the Bridegroom. The maidens' adoration parallels the Church's response to Christ's love and sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>, where the Church, as the Bride, rejoices in the marriage of the Lamb. This communal aspect underscores the idea that true love and virtue are recognized and celebrated by others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, traditionally understood to be the Shulammite woman, expressing her admiration for her beloved, often interpreted as Solomon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_maidens.htm">The Maidens</a></b><br>These are the young women or virgins who admire the beloved, symbolizing purity and the collective admiration for the beloved's character.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fragrance/perfume.htm">Fragrance/Perfume</a></b><br>Symbolic of the beloved's character and reputation, which is pleasing and attractive to others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_good_name.htm">The Power of a Good Name</a></b><br>A good reputation is invaluable and can influence others positively, much like a pleasing fragrance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/character_as_a_fragrance.htm">Character as a Fragrance</a></b><br>Just as perfume spreads and affects the environment, our character and actions impact those around us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/admiration_and_influence.htm">Admiration and Influence</a></b><br>The admiration of the maidens reflects how a life lived with integrity and love can draw others to us and, ultimately, to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_fragrance_in_worship.htm">Symbolism of Fragrance in Worship</a></b><br>Fragrance in the Bible often symbolizes worship and sacrifice, reminding us that our lives should be a pleasing offering to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_witness.htm">Community and Witness</a></b><br>The collective admiration of the maidens suggests the importance of community in recognizing and affirming godly character.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Song_of_Solomon_1_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Song of Solomon 1:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Song_of_Solomon_1_3_on_reputation.htm">How does Song of Solomon 1:3 highlight the importance of a good reputation?

In Scripture, fragrance often signals the delight God takes in acceptable sacrifices or lives lived in faithful love.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a> declares, &#8220;Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God,&#8221; showing that a life of love pleases God like a perfume.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a> adds, &#8220;For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ,&#8221; reminding us that believers, by reflecting Christ, carry His pleasing scent into the world.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7-8</a> pictures the royal bridegroom with &#8220;all your garments fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia,&#8221; accenting that true kingship is marked by a winsome, holy attractiveness.<p>Just as a pleasing scent quietly fills a room, the beloved&#8217;s character quietly draws hearts. True godliness cannot be hidden; its beauty naturally spreads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your name is like perfume poured out</b><p>&#8220;Your name is like perfume poured out&#8221; moves from scent to reputation. In Scripture, a &#8220;name&#8221; stands for the whole person&#8212;character, deeds, authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a> notes, &#8220;A good name is more desirable than great riches,&#8221; underscoring that a worthy reputation outlasts wealth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-10</a> tells how God &#8220;gave Him the name above all names,&#8221; so that &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,&#8221; revealing the supreme worth bound up in Christ&#8217;s name.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> proclaims, &#8220;There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved,&#8221; confirming that the poured-out worth of Jesus is life to all who believe.<p>The image of perfume &#8220;poured out&#8221; suggests generosity&#8212;nothing grudging, nothing held back.

Genuine holiness invites genuine affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/1-3.htm">Song of Solomon 1:3</a> paints a threefold portrait of the beloved: His pleasing presence, his matchless reputation, and the natural attraction these create. Like rich perfume, the aroma of Christ&#8217;s sacrificial love quietly fills the lives of those who draw near. His name&#8212;representing every aspect of His perfect character&#8212;has been lavishly poured out for the salvation of His people. Consequently, hearts awakened to His worth respond with adoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Because of the savour.</span>--The general sense of this verse is plain, though grammatical difficulties render the literal translation doubtful. It should be divided into three clauses, not into two only, as in the Authorised Version: "Because of their odour (or, with regard to their fragrance) thy ointments (are) sweet." There is no authority for taking <span class= "ital">riach = </span>sense of smell, or we should naturally translate "to the smell thy ointments are sweet." The rendering of the next clause, "thy name is (like) oil poured forth," is to be preferred, though it necessitates making either <span class= "ital">shemen </span>= oil, or <span class= "ital">shem = </span>name, feminine, for which there is no example, since the alternative, which takes <span class= "ital">t-rak </span>= poured forth, second masculine instead of third feminine, is harsh: "Thou art poured forth like oil with regard to thy name." The image is an obvious one (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm" title="A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>). There is a play on words in <span class= "ital">shemen </span>and <span class= "ital">shemka.</span><p><span class= "bld">Virgins</span>.--Heb., <span class= "ital">alamoth</span>;<span class= "ital"> young girls. </span>(See Note, <a href="/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>.) Those who understand Solomon to be the object of the desire expressed in these verses understand by <span class= "ital">alamoth </span>"the ladies of the harem." In the original these three verses plainly form a stanza of five lines<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins love thee.</span> There is some slight difference among critics as to the rendering of this verse, but it does not affect the meaning. Lovely and delightful thou art. As thy perfumes are so precious, so is thy name; the more it is spread, the more delight is found in it. The idea is that the person is the sweetest, and that his communications are elevating and inspiring. The "virgins" may be taken generally, "Those who are full of the sensibility of youth appreciate thy attractions." The word <span class="accented">almah</span> is much disputed about, but the meaning is simply that of "young woman," whether virgin or married. "Thou art the delight of all the young."
