The "beloved" is often interpreted as a representation of Christ, and the "garden" symbolizes the church or the soul of the believer. The imagery of a garden is frequently used in Scripture to denote a place of growth, beauty, and cultivation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8-9</a> with the Garden of Eden. The act of going down implies a deliberate action, reflecting Christ's incarnation and His coming into the world to dwell among His people.<p><b>to the beds of spices</b><br>Spices in biblical times were valuable and often used for anointing and worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>. The "beds of spices" can symbolize the richness and diversity of the church, filled with the fragrance of faith and good works. This imagery also connects to the anointing of Jesus with costly perfume in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>, highlighting the preciousness of devotion and worship.<p><b>to pasture his flock in the gardens</b><br>The pastoral imagery here is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd. The "gardens" suggest a place of nourishment and care, indicating Christ's role as the Good Shepherd who tends to His people, providing spiritual sustenance and guidance. This reflects the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers, as seen in <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a>.<p><b>and to gather lilies</b><br>Lilies are often associated with purity and beauty, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>, where Jesus speaks of the lilies of the field. In the context of the Song of Solomon, lilies can represent the virtues and graces of the church or the individual believer. The act of gathering implies selection and care, symbolizing Christ's gathering of His people, His bride, to Himself, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, where the church is presented as a pure and spotless bride.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the context of the Song of Solomon, the "beloved" often refers to the male lover, traditionally understood as King Solomon. In a broader spiritual sense, he can be seen as a representation of Christ, the Bridegroom of the Church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden.htm">The Garden</a></b><br>Symbolically, the garden represents a place of intimacy and beauty. It is a private space where the beloved and the lover meet, akin to the spiritual relationship between Christ and the believer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beds_of_spices.htm">Beds of Spices</a></b><br>These are areas within the garden filled with aromatic plants. They symbolize the richness and variety of the relationship, as well as the spiritual fruits and virtues cultivated in the life of a believer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lilies.htm">Lilies</a></b><br>Lilies are often associated with purity and beauty. In the context of the Song of Solomon, they can symbolize the purity and beauty of love, as well as the virtues of the Church or the believer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_christ.htm">Intimacy with Christ</a></b><br>Just as the beloved goes to the garden, believers are called to seek intimate fellowship with Christ. This involves setting aside time for prayer, worship, and meditation on His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_spiritual_fruits.htm">Cultivating Spiritual Fruits</a></b><br>The beds of spices and lilies represent the virtues and fruits of the Spirit that should be cultivated in a believer's life. Regular self-examination and reliance on the Holy Spirit are essential for growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_beauty_of_holiness.htm">The Beauty of Holiness</a></b><br>Lilies symbolize purity and beauty, reminding believers of the call to live holy lives that reflect the character of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit_of_love.htm">The Pursuit of Love</a></b><br>The beloved's journey to the garden is a pursuit of love.

Literally, Solomon visits the Shulammite&#8217;s realm of love; spiritually, Christ enters the life of His church to shepherd and rejoice in her purity. The verse celebrates intentional presence, tender care, and mutual delight&#8212;foundations for godly marriage and a vivid picture of the Savior&#8217;s faithful love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</span> In <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5, 6</a> Solomon says, "I planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared." In <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> it is said, "The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their Shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of water of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes." We can scarcely doubt that the meaning is - The bridegroom is not gone far; he is where he is congenially employed; where his pure and lovely nature finds that which is like itself - beauty and fragrance and innocence. It is his resort, and it corresponds with his perfection. Delitzsch thinks "thoughtfulness and depth of feeling are intended" (cf. <a href="/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>). "His thoughts are very deep." But it would seem more fitting, in the lips of the bride, that she should dwell on the aspects of her beloved which correspond with her own feelings. She is one of the lilies. The king is coming into his garden, and I am ready to receive him. The shepherd among his flock. They are all like lilies, pure and beautiful. The bride has nothing but chaste thoughts of her husband: because she knows that he is hers, and she is his. Surely such language is not inaptly applied to spiritual uses. Tennyson's lovely poem, 'St. Agnes' Eve,' has caught the spirit of Shulamith. A few of his lines will illustrate this - <p><span class="accented">"The shadows of the convent towers<br />Slant down the snowy sward,<br />Still creeping with the creeping hours<br />That lead me to my Lord.</span> <p><span class="accented">Make thou my spirit pure and clear<br />As are the frosty skies,<br />Or this first snowdrop of the year<br />That in my bosom lies.</span> <p><span class="accented">He lifts me to the golden doors;<br />The flashes come and go;<br />All Heaven bursts her starry floors,<br />And strews her lights below,</span>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
