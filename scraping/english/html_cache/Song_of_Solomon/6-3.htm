In the context of the Song of Solomon, it reflects the intimate and exclusive relationship between the bride and the bridegroom. Historically, this can be seen as a reflection of the covenant relationship between God and His people, Israel, where God often refers to Israel as His bride (<a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). In a broader theological context, it symbolizes the relationship between Christ and the Church, where believers are seen as the bride of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The language of belonging suggests a deep, personal connection and commitment, which is central to the covenantal relationships found throughout Scripture.<p><b>and he belongs to me;</b><br>This continuation of mutual belonging underscores the reciprocal nature of love and commitment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, marriage was often seen as a partnership where both parties had responsibilities and rights. This mutual belonging can also be seen as a type of the relationship between Christ and the Church, where Christ is devoted to His Church, and the Church is devoted to Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). Theologically, it highlights the security and assurance believers have in their relationship with Christ, knowing that He is committed to them as they are to Him.<p><b>he pastures his flock among the lilies.</b><br>This imagery of pasturing among the lilies suggests a setting of peace, beauty, and abundance. Lilies are often associated with purity and beauty in Scripture (<a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>). The pastoral imagery is reminiscent of the Good Shepherd motif found in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd who cares for His sheep. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the care and provision that Christ provides for His people, leading them to places of spiritual nourishment and rest. The pastoral setting also evokes the idyllic and harmonious relationship between the beloved and the speaker, reflecting the ideal relationship between Christ and His Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>In the Song of Solomon, the beloved is often interpreted as Solomon or a representation of Christ in allegorical readings.

There is no room for rivals.<p>&#8226; In the broader biblical pattern, belonging brings security and worth. Believers are &#8220;bought with a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>) and are God&#8217;s &#8220;peculiar people&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), showing the abiding principle that covenant love claims the whole person.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he belongs to me</b><p>&#8226; Mutual possession balances the relationship. The bride is cherished, and the bridegroom is equally committed (Songs 4:9-10).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this reciprocity when he says, &#8220;The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Such language celebrates equality of value within distinct roles. Husbands are called to loving headship (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-29</a>), yet they are not distant owners; they give themselves fully, just as Christ gave Himself for the church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he pastures his flock among the lilies</b><p>&#8226; The shepherd imagery conveys tender care. Solomon (the earthly shepherd-king) leads his bride to places of beauty and rest, not to barren ground (Songs 2:16; <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Lilies picture purity and delight (<a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>). The bridegroom does not merely possess; he provides&#8212;sustaining and nurturing.<p>&#8226; Prophetic overtones emerge: the coming Messiah would stand as &#8220;the Good Shepherd&#8221; who &#8220;lays down His life for the sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The scene in Song points ahead to the Shepherd-King whose flock enjoys abundant, fragrant pasture (<a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Song 6:3 celebrates covenant intimacy that is both exclusive and mutual. The bride joyfully belongs to her beloved, and he just as joyfully belongs to her. Their love is safeguarded by the shepherd-like care of the bridegroom, who leads her into places of purity, provision, and peace. The verse paints a literal portrait of marital devotion while reflecting the larger biblical theme of the Lord&#8217;s faithful, nourishing love for His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">belong to my beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
