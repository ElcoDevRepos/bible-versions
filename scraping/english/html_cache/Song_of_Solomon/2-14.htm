In the context of Song of Solomon, the dove represents the beloved, who is cherished and gentle. The "clefts of the rock" suggest a place of safety and refuge, reminiscent of God providing protection, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a> when God places Moses in the cleft of the rock. This phrase evokes the idea of intimacy and security within a relationship, where the beloved is hidden yet cherished.<p><b>in the crevices of the cliff</b><br>The "crevices of the cliff" further emphasize the idea of seclusion and protection. In ancient times, cliffs and rocks were natural fortresses, offering safety from enemies. This setting can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual refuge found in God, as well as the intimate and protected relationship between the lovers. The imagery also suggests a sense of mystery and allure, as the beloved is partially hidden from view.<p><b>let me see your face</b><br>The desire to see the beloved's face indicates a longing for closeness and personal connection. In biblical terms, seeing someone's face often signifies favor and acceptance, as in <a href="/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>, where the Lord's face shining upon someone is a blessing. This request reflects the deep yearning for communion and the unveiling of the beloved's presence.<p><b>let me hear your voice</b><br>Hearing the beloved's voice is a metaphor for communication and understanding. In the biblical context, the voice is powerful and significant, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks creation into existence. The request to hear the voice underscores the importance of dialogue and the joy found in the beloved's words, reflecting the intimate exchange between the lovers.<p><b>for your voice is sweet</b><br>The sweetness of the voice highlights the pleasure and delight found in the beloved's words. This can be compared to the psalmist's description of God's words as "sweeter than honey" (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>). The sweetness signifies the deep affection and satisfaction derived from the relationship, emphasizing the beauty and desirability of the beloved's communication.<p><b>and your countenance is lovely</b><br>The loveliness of the countenance speaks to the overall beauty and grace of the beloved. In biblical literature, physical beauty often symbolizes inner virtue and favor, as seen in the description of Rachel in <a href="/genesis/29-17.htm">Genesis 29:17</a>.

The bridegroom is still addressing his beloved one, who has not yet come forth from the house in the rocks, though she has shown herself at the window. The language is highly poetical, and may be compared with similar words in Homer and Virgil (cf. 'Iliad.' 21:493; 'Aeneid.' 5:213, etc.). The Lord loveth the sight of his people. He delightcth in their songs and in their prayers. He is in the midst of their assemblies. Secret religion is not the highest religion. The highest emotions of the soul do not decrease in their power as they are expressed. They become more and more a ruling principle of life. There are many who need this encouragement to come forth out of secrecy, out of solitude, out of their own private home and individual thoughts, and realize the blessing of fellowship with the Lord and with his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">O my dove</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
