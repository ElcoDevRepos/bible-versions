It reflects the believer's state of being in the world but not of it, as seen in <a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>, where Jesus tells His disciples to watch and pray. The heart's wakefulness suggests a readiness to respond to the divine call, reminiscent of the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, emphasizing the importance of spiritual vigilance.<p><b>A sound! My beloved is knocking:</b><br>The knocking of the beloved symbolizes Christ's call to the church, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>, where Jesus stands at the door and knocks, inviting believers to fellowship with Him. This imagery also recalls the urgency and persistence of divine love, urging immediate response and intimacy with the Savior.<p><b>&#8220;Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one.</b><br>The terms of endearment highlight the deep affection and intimate relationship between the beloved and the bride, symbolizing Christ's love for the church. "Sister" suggests a familial bond, while "darling" and "dove" convey purity and gentleness. "Flawless one" points to the imputed righteousness of believers through Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, where the church is presented as a radiant bride without blemish.<p><b>My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of dew and night suggests the beloved's earnest pursuit and the challenges faced in seeking communion. Dew often symbolizes blessing and renewal in Scripture, as in <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>. The night represents trials and the persistence of Christ's love despite obstacles, echoing the perseverance of the Good Shepherd in seeking His sheep, as described in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as the Shulammite woman, who represents the Church or the individual believer in allegorical readings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The bridegroom, often seen as a representation of Christ in allegorical interpretations, who seeks intimacy and fellowship with the bride.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_night.htm">The Night</a></b><br>Symbolic of times of spiritual slumber or distance, yet also a time when the beloved seeks entry, indicating a desire for closeness even in darkness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_alertness.htm">Spiritual Alertness</a></b><br>Even when we are at rest, our hearts should remain attuned to the voice of Christ.

Jesus said, &#8220;Keep watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul echoes the call: &#8220;So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even at night the psalmist testified, &#8220;my conscience instructs me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a>), showing how a heart tuned to the Lord stays awake while the body sleeps.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A sound! My beloved is knocking</b><p>&#8226; The sudden exclamation captures the urgency of the visit. The groom pursues his bride; she does not summon him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> gives the parallel invitation from Christ: &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus described servants who &#8220;open for him immediately when he comes and knocks&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>). The readiness He seeks is the readiness the bride is being called to display.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a> warns, &#8220;The Judge is standing at the door,&#8221; underscoring that the knock carries authority as well as affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one</b><p>&#8226; Four titles cascade over the bride:<p>&#8211; Sister &#8211; family bond and shared inheritance (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Darling &#8211; intimate affection (Songs 1:15).<p>&#8211; Dove &#8211; gentleness and single-minded devotion (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Flawless &#8211; the groom sees no defect: &#8220;You are altogether beautiful, my darling; in you there is no flaw&#8221; (Songs 4:7).<p>&#8226; In New-Covenant terms, Christ &#8220;loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8230; that she might be holy and blameless&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The invitation therefore rests on relationship, not performance; the bride is urged to act from an already-given acceptance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night</b><p>&#8226; The groom has traveled through the chill darkness to reach her door.

Literally, it advances Solomon&#8217;s love story; typologically, it portrays Christ&#8217;s persistent call to His people. The groom invites immediate, wholehearted response, because the relationship is already secure and his love has already paid the cost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">I sleep.</span>--This begins the old story under an image already employed (<a href="/songs/3-1.htm" title="By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.">Song of Solomon 3:1</a>). Here it is greatly amplified and elaborated. The poet pictures his lady dreaming of him, and when he seems to visit her, anxious to admit him. But, as is so common in dreams, at first she cannot. The realities which had hindered their union reappear in the fancies of sleep. Then, when the seeming hindrance is withdrawn, she finds him gone, and, as before, searches for him in vain. This gives opportunity to introduce the description of the charms of the lost lover, and so the end of the piece, the union of the pair, is delayed to <a href="/songs/6-3.htm" title="I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feeds among the lilies.">Song of Solomon 6:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">My head is filled with dew.</span>--Anacreon, iii. 10 is often compared to this.<p>"<span class= "ital">' </span>Fear not,' said he, with piteous din,<p>'Pray ope the door and let me in.<p>A poor unshelter'd boy am I,<p>For help who knows not where to fly:<p>Lost in the dark, and with the dews,<p>All cold and wet, that midnight brews.'" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2-ch. 8:4.</span> - Part IV.

In the former case the lover is represented as dismissed for a season, and then the relenting heart of the maiden sought after him and found him. In this case he "stands at the door and knocks," coming in the night; and the maiden rises to open, but finds him gone, and so is drawn after him. The second dream is much more vivid and elaborate, and seems to be an imitation and enlargement of the other, being introduced apparently more for the sake of dwelling on the attractions of the beloved one and his preciousness in the eyes of the maiden than in self-reproach. Is it not possible that the poem originally concluded at <a href="/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a> with the marriage, and that the whole of the latter half was an amplification, either by Solomon himself, the author of the first half, or by some one who has entered into the spirit of the song? This would explain the apparent repetition, with the variations. But, at all events, the second part certainly is more from the standpoint of married life than the first. Hence the bride speaks at great length, which she does not in the earlier portion. Delitzsch thinks that this second love dream is intended to represent what occurred in early married life; but there are two objections to that - <span class="accented">first</span>, that the place is evidently a country residence; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, that such an occurrence is unsuitable to the conditions of a royal bride. It is much more natural to suppose that the bride is recalling what occurred in her dream when the lover, having been sent away until the evening, as on the former occasion, returned, and in the night knocked at the door. "My heart waked" is the same as "My mind was active." The "heart" in Hebrew is the inner man, both intellect and feeling. "I was asleep, but I was thinking" (cf. Cicero, 'De Divinatione,' 1:30). The lover has come off a long journey over the mountains, and arrives in the night time.
