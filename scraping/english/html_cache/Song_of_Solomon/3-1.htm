In biblical times, the night was a period of rest but also of reflection and sometimes anxiety. The bed symbolizes a place of intimacy and personal thoughts. The night can also represent a spiritual darkness or a period of waiting for God's presence, as seen in <a href="/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>, where David meditates on God during the night watches.<p><b>I sought the one I love;</b><br>The act of seeking indicates a deep desire and earnest pursuit. In the context of the Song of Solomon, this reflects the bride's longing for her beloved, symbolizing the soul's yearning for communion with God. This pursuit can be likened to the search for wisdom in <a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>, where seeking is portrayed as a diligent and passionate endeavor. The "one I love" can be seen as a type of Christ, representing the believer's relationship with Jesus, who is the ultimate beloved of the soul.<p><b>I sought him,</b><br>The repetition of seeking emphasizes the intensity and persistence of the search. It reflects a personal and active engagement in the pursuit of the beloved. This mirrors the biblical theme of seeking God with all one's heart, as encouraged in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>. The personal pronoun "him" underscores the intimate and exclusive nature of the relationship, pointing to the personal relationship believers are called to have with Christ.<p><b>but did not find him.</b><br>This phrase introduces a moment of tension and unfulfilled desire. It reflects the reality of spiritual longing and the occasional sense of God's absence, which can be a test of faith and perseverance. This echoes the experience of the psalmist in <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, who cries out to God in a time of perceived abandonment. The absence of the beloved can also be seen as a call to deeper faith and trust, encouraging believers to continue seeking until they find the presence and peace of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, traditionally understood to be the bride or beloved in the Song of Solomon.

Here the bride remembers her beloved, mirroring moments when believers ponder God in solitude (<a href="/psalms/63-6.htm">Psalm 63:6</a>, &#8220;When I remember You on my bed and think of You through the watches of the night&#8221;).<p>&#8226; A bed also pictures rest and security; longing surfaces when rest is incomplete without the loved one, much as the soul discovers that true rest is only found in the presence of the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at night</b><p>&#8226; Night often represents seasons of obscurity or trial (<a href="/psalms/77-6.htm">Psalm 77:6</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>). In the dark, distractions fade, allowing unmet desires to surface.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, night can symbolize times when God&#8217;s face seems hidden, yet those very hours invite deeper seeking (<a href="/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>, &#8220;My soul longs for You in the night&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I sought the one I love</b><p>&#8226; Love drives the search.

Literally, it illustrates the intensity of covenant love between husband and wife&#8212;love that prompts pursuit even when togetherness is momentarily withheld. Spiritually, it reflects the believer&#8217;s longing for closer fellowship with the Lord. Seasons of darkness or perceived distance are allowed to stir deeper desire, perseverance, and eventual joy when communion is restored.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">III.</span><p>(1) A reminiscence (elaborated in <a href="/songs/5-2.htm" title="I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.">Song of Solomon 5:2</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span>) of the intensity of their love before their union, put by the poet into his lady's mouth. She "arises from dreams" of him, and goes to find him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</span> The bride is probably relating a dream. The time referred to is the close of the day on which she had been visited by her lover. She is retired to rest, and dreams that she searches for the beloved object in the neighbouring city (cf. <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>). It is another way of telling her love. She is always longing for the beloved one. She had been waiting for him, and he came not, and retired to rest with a heart troubled and anxious because her lover did not appear as she expected at the evening hour. The meaning may be "night after night (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>)" (cf. <a href="/songs/3-8.htm">Song of Solomon 3:8</a>), or the plural maybe used poetically for the singular. Ginsburg observes that "by night on my bed" is opposed to midday couch (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>), merely to express what came into her thoughts at night in her dreams or as the result of a dream. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the bride intends to represent herself as suffering from self-reproach in having grieved her lover and kept him away from her. In that case the typical meaning would be simple and direct. The soul grieves when it is conscious of estrangement from him whom it loves, and the sense of separation becomes intolerable, impelling to new efforts to deepen the spiritual life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my bed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;k&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
