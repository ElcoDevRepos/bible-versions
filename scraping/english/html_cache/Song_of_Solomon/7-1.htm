The mention of "sandaled feet" suggests a sense of elegance and readiness, as sandals were a common footwear in ancient Israel, often associated with travel and movement. The reference to "daughter of the prince" indicates a person of high status, possibly alluding to the church as the bride of Christ, who is often depicted as a royal bride in scripture (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The imagery of beauty and nobility can also be seen in <a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>, which describes the royal bride adorned in splendor.<p><b>The curves of your thighs are like jewels,</b><br>This phrase uses the metaphor of jewels to describe the beloved's thighs, suggesting value, beauty, and craftsmanship. In biblical times, jewels were precious and rare, symbolizing worth and splendor. The comparison to jewels indicates the beloved's physical beauty and the admiration it inspires. This can be seen as a reflection of the church's beauty in the eyes of Christ, as believers are considered precious and valuable (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The use of such intimate imagery also underscores the deep love and affection present in the relationship.<p><b>the handiwork of a master.</b><br>The phrase "handiwork of a master" implies skillful creation, suggesting that the beloved's beauty is not accidental but crafted with intention and care. This can be seen as a reflection of God's creation, as humanity is described as fearfully and wonderfully made (<a href="/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>). The master craftsman imagery can also be connected to the idea of God as the potter and humans as the clay (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>), emphasizing divine craftsmanship and purpose. In a broader sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate master craftsman, shaping and molding the church into His likeness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is often interpreted as the bridegroom, who is expressing admiration for his bride. This reflects the intimate and loving relationship between the two.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Referred to as "prince&#8217;s daughter," she symbolizes beauty, grace, and nobility.

The reference may be to character rather than descent, just as in the opposite expression, "daughter of Belial" (<a href="/1_samuel/1-16.htm" title="Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.">1Samuel 1:16</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Joints.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">cham-k, </span>from <span class= "ital">chamah--</span>went away, probably refers to the rapid movements in dancing, and the image is suggested by the graceful curves formed by a chain or pendulous ornament when in motion.

The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</span> To the ladies who are looking on the bride appears simply noble and royal. The word <span class="accented">naudhib</span> which is used, translated "prince's daughter," means "noble in disposition," and so in birth and rank, as in <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>; so in <a href="/songs/6-12.htm">Song of Solomon 6:12</a>, "the princely people." The description, which is perfectly chaste, is intended to bring before the eye the lithe and beautiful movements of an elegant dancer; the bendings of the body, full of activity and grace, are compared to the swinging to and fro of jewelled ornaments made in chains. The cunning workman or artist is one who is master of that which abides beautiful. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, like, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "whose truthful work can be trusted." The description passes from the thighs or loins to the middle part of the body, because in the mode of dancing prevailing in the East the breast and the body, are raised, and the outlines of the form appear through the clothing, which is of a light texture. We must not expect to find a symbolical meaning for all the details of such a description. The general intention is to set forth the beauty and glory of the bride. The Church of Christ is most delightful in his sight when it is most full of activity and life, and every portion of it is called forth into manifest excellence. "<span class="accented">Arise</span>, <span class="accented">shine</span>," is the invitation addressed to the whole Church, "shake thyself from the dust," "put on thy beautiful garments," be ready for thy Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">beautiful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3303.htm">Strong's 3303: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fair, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are your sandaled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ban&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
