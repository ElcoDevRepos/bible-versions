It served as the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel before Samaria. The mention of Tirzah highlights the beloved's beauty in a way that would resonate with the original audience, who would understand the city's renown. This comparison elevates the beloved's beauty to a level of national pride and admiration. The use of "my darling" indicates a deep, personal affection, emphasizing the intimate relationship between the speaker and the beloved, which can be seen as a reflection of the intimate relationship between Christ and the Church.<p><b>as lovely as Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel, was revered for its beauty and significance as the city of God. By comparing the beloved to Jerusalem, the speaker not only acknowledges her physical beauty but also her spiritual and moral qualities. Jerusalem was the site of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence, which adds a layer of holiness and reverence to the comparison. This can be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, which is called to be holy and set apart.<p><b>as majestic as troops with banners</b><br>The imagery of "troops with banners" conveys strength, order, and dignity. In ancient times, banners were used in military contexts to signify unity and purpose. This phrase suggests that the beloved possesses a commanding presence and an inner strength that is both awe-inspiring and admirable. The majesty of the beloved can be seen as a reflection of the Church's role in spiritual warfare, standing firm in faith and unity. This imagery also connects to the victorious nature of Christ, who leads His people in triumph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is the bridegroom, often interpreted as Solomon, who is expressing his admiration for his bride.

This fixes the date of the composition of the poem within certain limits (see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>I.). Jeroboam first selected the ancient sanctuary of Shechem for his capital; but, from some unexplained cause, moved the seat of his government, first to Penuel, on the other side Jordan, and then to Tirzah, formerly the seat of a petty Canaanite prince. (See <a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm" title="Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelled therein; and went out from there, and built Penuel.">1Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm" title="And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;">1Kings 14:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelled in Tirzah.">1Kings 15:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-33.htm" title="In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.">1Kings 15:33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-6.htm" title="So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.">1Kings 16:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm" title="In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.">1Kings 16:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.">1Kings 16:15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-18.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.">1Kings 16:18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1Kings 16:23</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-24.htm" title="The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.">Joshua 12:24</a>.) Robinson identified <span class= "ital">Tirzah </span>with <span class= "ital">Tell-zah, </span>not far from Mount Ebal, which agrees with Brocardus, who places <span class= "ital">Thersa </span>on a high mountain, three degrees from Samaria to the east. Tirzah only remained the capital till the reign of Omri, but comes into notice again as the scene of the conspiracy of Menahem against Shallum (<a href="/context/2_kings/15-14.htm" title="For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.">2Kings 15:14-16</a>). The LXX. translate <span class= "ital">Tirzah </span>by <span class= "greekheb">???????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>Vulg. <span class= "ital">suavis</span>; and the ancient versions generally adopt this plan, to avoid, as Dr. Ginsburg thinks, the mention of the two capitals, because this made against the Solomonic authorship. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats that lie along the side of Gilead. Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes which are come up from the washing, whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</span> The king is not far off. The bride knows that he is near. She prepares herself for him with words of love. He is coming among his "rosebud garden. of girls." His voice is heard as he approaches. And as he enters the chamber he bursts forth with lavish praises of his bride. Tirzah and Jerusalem, two of the most beautiful cities of the world, are taken as symbols of the surpassing beauty of the bride - doubtless also with an intended reference to the symbology of Scripture, where the people of God are compared throughout to a city. Tirzah was discovered by Robinson in 1852, on a height in the mountain range to the north of Nablus, under the name <span class="accented">Tulluzah</span>, high and beautiful, in a region of olive trees. The name itself signifies sweetness, which might be so employed even if there were no actual city so called. Jerusalem is said to have been "the perfection of beauty" (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). Cities are generally spoken of as females, as also nations. The Church is the city of God. The new Jerusalem is the bride of the Lamb. If the prophets did not take their language from this Song of Solomon, then the phraseology and symbology which we find here must have been familiarly known and used among the people of Israel from the time of Solomon. The beauty of the bride is overwhelming, it is subduing and all-conquering, like a warrior host with flying banners going forth to victory. Solomon confesses that he is vanquished. This, of course, is the hyperbole of love, but it is full of significance to the spiritual mind. The Church of Christ in the presence and power of the Lord is irresistible. It is not until he appears that the bride is seen in her perfection. She hangs her head and complains while he is absent; but when he comes and reveals himself, delighting in his people, their beauty, which is a reflection of his, will shine forth as the sun forever and ever. The word which is employed, "terrible," is from the root "to be impetuous," "to press impetuously upon," "to infuse terror," LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to make to start up," referring to the flash of the eyes, the overpowering brightness of the countenance. So the purity and excellence of the Church shall delight the Lord, and no earthly power shall be able to stand before it. Heaven and earth shall meet in the latter days. Wickedness shall fly before righteousness as a detbated host before a victorious army. Is there not something like a practical commentary on these words in the history of all great revivals of religion and eras of reformation? Are there not signs even now that the beauty of the Church is becoming more and more army-like, and bearing down opposition? The remainder of the description is little more than a repetition of what has gone before, with some differences. Mount Gilead is here simply Gilead. The flock of shorn sheep is here the flock of ewes with their young. Perhaps there is intended to be a special significance in the use of the same description. The bride is the same, and therefore the same terms apply to her; but she is more beautiful than ever in the eyes of the bridegroom. Is it not a delicate mode of saying, "Though my absence from thee has made thee complain for a while, thou art still the same to me"? There is scope here for variety of interpretation which there is no need to follow. Some would say the reference is to the state of the Church at different periods - as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to the primitive Church in its simplicity and purity, to the Church of the empire in its splendour and growing dominion. The Jewish expositors apply it to the different stages in the history of Israel, "the congregation" being the bride, as under the first temple and under the second temple. Ibn Ezra, and indeed all expositors, recognize the reason for the repetition as in the sameness of affection. "The beloved repeats the same things here to show that it is still his own true bride to whom he speaks, the sameness in the features proving it." So the Targum. The flock of goats, the flock of ewes, the piece of pomegranate, all suggest the simple purity of country life in which the king found so much satisfaction, he is wrapt up in his northern beauty, and idolizes her. One cannot help thinking of the early Jewish Church coming forth from Galilee, when all spoke of the freshness and genuineness of a simple-hearted piety drawn forth by the preaching of the Son of Mary - the virgin-born Bridegroom whose bride was like the streams and flowers, the birds and flocks, of beautiful Galilee; a society of believing peasants untouched by the conventionalities of Judaea, and ready to respond to the grand mountain like earnestness and heavenly purity of the new Prophet, the Shepherd of Israel, "who feedeth his flock among the lilies." There is a correspondence in the early Church, before corruption crept in and sophistication obscured the simplicity of faith and life among Christians, to this description of the bride, the Lamb's wife. There must be a return to that primitive ideal before there can be the rapturous joy of the Church which is promised. We are too much turned aside from the Bridegroom to false and worthless attractions which do not delight the Beloved One. When he sees his bride as he first saw her, he will renew his praises and lift her up to himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are beautiful,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3303.htm">Strong's 3303: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fair, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my darling,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#8216;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
