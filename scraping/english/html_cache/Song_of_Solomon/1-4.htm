In the context of the Song of Solomon, this can be seen as an expression of the desire for intimacy and union. The urgency ("let us hurry") suggests a passionate and eager love. Biblically, this can be compared to the believer's longing for a closer relationship with Christ, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, where Paul expresses a desire to know Christ more deeply. The imagery of being taken away can also be reminiscent of the Exodus, where God led His people out of Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and a journey towards a promised relationship.<p><b>May the king bring me to his chambers.</b><br>The reference to "the king" elevates the bridegroom to a royal status, which can be seen as a type of Christ, the King of Kings. The "chambers" symbolize a place of intimacy and privacy, suggesting a deep, personal relationship. Historically, royal chambers were places of privilege and honor, indicating the special status of the bride. This can be paralleled with <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where Jesus speaks of preparing a place for believers, highlighting the intimate and eternal relationship between Christ and His church.<p><b>We will rejoice and delight in you;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes communal joy and celebration in the presence of the beloved. In the context of the church, this can be seen as the collective worship and adoration of Christ by believers. The joy and delight reflect the fruits of a relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>, where joy is listed as a fruit of the Spirit. The communal aspect ("we") underscores the unity and fellowship among believers, as encouraged in <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>.<p><b>we will praise your love more than wine.</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a symbol of joy, celebration, and abundance. To praise love more than wine suggests that the love of the bridegroom is more fulfilling and satisfying than the greatest earthly pleasures. This can be connected to <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>, where believers are encouraged to be filled with the Spirit rather than wine, indicating the superior joy found in a relationship with Christ. The comparison elevates divine love above all earthly experiences.<p><b>It is only right that they adore you.</b><br>This final phrase acknowledges the worthiness of the beloved to be adored. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the rightful worship and adoration due to God. <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> echoes this sentiment, declaring the worthiness of God to receive glory and honor. The phrase suggests a natural and appropriate response to the beloved's character and actions, paralleling the believer's response to the love and sacrifice of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shulammite_woman.htm">The Shulammite Woman</a></b><br>The primary female character in the Song of Solomon, often interpreted as a representation of the bride or the church in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as Solomon, representing the bridegroom or Christ in allegorical interpretations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chambers.htm">The Chambers</a></b><br>Symbolic of intimacy and closeness, often interpreted as a place of deep personal relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_jerusalem.htm">The Daughters of Jerusalem</a></b><br>They are the onlookers or chorus in the account, representing the community of believers or those observing the relationship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_love.htm">The Love</a></b><br>Represents the deep, abiding love between the bride and bridegroom, often seen as a metaphor for the love between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_god.htm">Intimacy with God</a></b><br>The call to be "drawn away" signifies a desire for deeper intimacy with God.

The clause, "the king hath brought," &c, is--in accordance with a common Hebrew idiom, where an hypothesis is expressed by a simple perfect or future without a particle (comp. <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm" title="See you a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.">Proverbs 22:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-16.htm" title="Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.">Proverbs 25:16</a>)--to be understood, "Even should the king have brought me into his chambers, yet our transport and our joys are for <span class= "ital">thee </span>alone; even then we would recall thy caresses, those caresses which are sweeter than wine."<p><span class= "bld">The upright love thee.</span>--Marg., <span class= "ital">they love thee uprightly; </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">meysharim, </span>used in other places either (1) in the abstract, "righteousness," &c, <a href="/psalms/17-2.htm" title="Let my sentence come forth from your presence; let your eyes behold the things that are equal.">Psalm 17:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-4.htm" title="The king's strength also loves judgment; you do establish equity, you execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.">Psalm 99:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-6.htm" title="Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.">Proverbs 8:6</a> (so LXX. here); or (2) adverbially, <a href="/psalms/58-2.htm" title="Yes, in heart you work wickedness; you weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm" title="The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.">Psalm 75:3</a> (and <a href="/songs/7-9.htm" title="And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.">Song of Solomon 7:9</a> below; but there the <span class= "ital">Lamed </span>prefixed fixes the adverbial use). The Authorised Version follows the Vulg., <span class= "ital">Recti diligunt te, </span>and is to be preferred, as bringing the clause into parallelism with the concluding clause of <a href="/songs/1-3.htm" title="Because of the smell of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you.">Song of Solomon 1:3</a> : "Thou who hast won the love of all maidens by thy personal attractions, hast gained that of the sincere and upright ones by thy character and thy great name." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will make mention of thy love more than of wine: rightly do they love thee.</span> This is best taken as all spoken by the bride. It is the language of the purest affection and adoring admiration. "I drew them," God says (<a href="/hosea/11-4.htm">Hosea 11:4</a>), "with cords of a man, with bands of love." "The Lord appeared of old unto me," says Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>), "saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee." In the same sense the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is used by our Lord himself of the Father <span class="accented">drawing</span> to the Son, and of the Son, uplifted on the cross, "drawing" all men unto him (cf. <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>; <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>). If the spiritual meaning of the whole poem is admitted, such language is quite natural. The king's chambers are the king's own rooms in the palace, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his sleeping, rooms and sitting rooms - the <span class="accented">penetralia regis.</span> We may take the preterite as equivalent to the present; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "The king is bringing me into closest fellowship with himself, not merely as a member of his household, but as his chosen bride." The concluding words have caused much discussion. The meaning, however, is the same whether we say, "The upright love thee," or "Thou art rightly loved." The intention is to set forth the object of love as perfect. The plural, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, is used to signify the abstract of the word, thought, or act; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "righteous," for "rightly" (cf. <a href="/psalms/58-2.htm">Psalm 58:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-3.htm">Psalm 75:3</a>); but the best critics think it could not be the abstract for the concrete plural, as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Recti diligunt re.</span> The same use of the word is seen in eh. 7:9, "The best wine that teeth down <span class="accented">smoothly</span> for my beloved" (cf. <a href="/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a>). Before going further in the song, it is well to observe how chaste, pure, and delicate is the language of love; and yet, as Delitzsch has pointed out, there is a mystical, cloudy brightness. We seem to be in the region of the ideal. It is not a mere love song, though it may have been the commemoration of an actual past. The Eastern form of the words may be less suited to our taste than it would be to those who first embraced Christianity, and to the nineteenth century than to the first; but the loving rapture of the Church in fellowship with the Saviour is certainly seeking a more vivid expression in song, and there are many of the most simple-minded and devoted Christians whose joy in Christ pours itself out freely in strains not much less fervid and almost as sensuous as anything to be found in Solomon's Song. Some are beginning to remonstrate against this freedom of devotional language, but the instinct of the Church seems to justify it as the demand of the heart under the influence of the Word of God itself. Perhaps there is a state of religious feeling coming into the experience of Christians which will remove the veil from such a book as the Song of Songs, and we shall yet find that its language is needful and is not extravagant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1430;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular &#124;
