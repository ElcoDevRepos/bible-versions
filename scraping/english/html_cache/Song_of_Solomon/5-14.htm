Gold, often associated with divinity and kingship in the Bible, suggests the beloved's noble and precious nature. Beryl, a precious stone mentioned in the priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), symbolizes beauty and rarity. The arms, described as rods, indicate strength and stability, qualities admired in a leader or protector. This imagery can be seen as a type of Christ, whose strength and divine nature are central to His role as Savior and King. The use of precious materials reflects the high esteem and love the bride has for her beloved, paralleling the church's adoration for Christ.<p><b>His body is polished ivory bedecked with sapphires.</b><br>Ivory, known for its smoothness and rarity, signifies purity and value. In ancient times, ivory was a luxury item, often used in royal settings, indicating the beloved's esteemed status. The polished nature of the ivory suggests refinement and perfection. Sapphires, another precious stone, are associated with heavenly realms and divine favor (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). The combination of ivory and sapphires in this description highlights the beloved's beauty and worth, both physically and spiritually. This can be seen as a reflection of Christ's purity and the heavenly nature of His kingdom. The imagery evokes a sense of awe and reverence, akin to the church's view of Christ as the perfect and divine bridegroom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The male figure in the Song of Solomon, often interpreted as King Solomon or a representation of Christ in allegorical readings.

Gold in Scripture often signals purity, enduring worth, and royalty (<a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). Here the bride delights in a husband whose strength is both protective and priceless. Beryl, a brilliant gem, adds sparkle to the image. Think of:<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>, where beryl is fixed into the high priest&#8217;s breastpiece, symbolizing dignity and intercession.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>, &#8220;See, the Lord GOD comes with power, and His arm rules for Him&#8221;. The groom&#8217;s &#8220;golden&#8221; arms mirror the Lord&#8217;s mighty, saving arm&#8212;strength exercised for the beloved&#8217;s good.<p>For marriage, this calls husbands to wield strength that is valuable, not oppressive; for believers, it points to Christ whose power is pure, protective, and infinitely precious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His body is polished ivory</b><p>Ivory is prized for its smoothness, whiteness, and rarity. A body &#8220;polished&#8221; suggests flawless beauty, deliberately cared for and fully exposed to the bride without blemish. Compare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, where Christ presents the church to Himself &#8220;without spot or wrinkle.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>, a messianic wedding psalm describing the King whose robes are fragrant, emphasizing both attractiveness and holiness.<p>Ivory does not decay quickly; it keeps its luster. The groom&#8217;s physique hints at enduring vitality, foreshadowing Christ whose resurrected body can never see corruption (<a href="/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>). For a believing couple, it urges physical honor, valuing each other&#8217;s God-given bodies without shame.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bedecked with sapphires</b><p>Sapphires, with their deep blue hue, evoke the heavens and royal majesty. <a href="/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a> notes that under God&#8217;s feet the pavement &#8220;was like a sapphire stone, clear as the sky itself&#8221;; <a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a> lists sapphire as a foundation stone of the New Jerusalem. Draping the polished ivory with sapphires highlights:<p>&#8226; Majestic beauty&#8212;an outward splendor that matches inward purity.<p>&#8226; Heavenly orientation&#8212;the bride sees something of eternity in her husband, just as the church sees heaven&#8217;s glory in Christ.<p>&#8226; Covenant depth&#8212;the groom&#8217;s beauty is not fleeting fashion but jewel-anchored stability, echoing God&#8217;s unbreakable promises (<a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/songs/5-14.htm">Song of Solomon 5:14</a> paints a husband whose strength is as valuable as gold, whose purity is as smooth and enduring as polished ivory, and whose beauty reflects heavenly sapphire splendor. Literally, it celebrates the delight, honor, and security a wife finds in her beloved. Spiritually, it points to Jesus Christ&#8212;powerful yet pure, flawless yet approachable, regal yet relational&#8212;inviting believers to adore Him and to let His character shape every marriage and every heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/songs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">His hands </span>. . .--Galil, translated <span class= "ital">ring</span>, is more probably a <span class= "ital">cylinder </span>(from <span class= "ital">galal, </span>to roll), referring to the rounded arm, ending in a well-shaped hand with beautiful nails.<p><span class= "bld">Beryl.</span>--Heb. <span class= "ital">tarshish</span>; LXX. <span class= "greekheb">??????</span><span class= "ital">. </span>Possibly "stones of Tarshish," and if so, either chrysolite or topaz, both said to have been first found in Tartessus, an ancient city of Spain, between the two mouths of the B?tis (Guadalquiver).
