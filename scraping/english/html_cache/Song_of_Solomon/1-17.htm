The use of cedar wood in construction is a symbol of strength and permanence. In biblical times, cedar was often imported from Lebanon, as it was considered the finest wood available. This phrase may evoke the grandeur of Solomon's Temple, which was built using cedar wood (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). The mention of "our house" suggests a shared dwelling, symbolizing unity and stability in the relationship. The cedar beams can also be seen as a metaphor for the strength and enduring nature of love, reflecting the divine love that is unchanging and eternal.<p><b>our rafters are fragrant firs.</b><br>Firs, like cedars, were also used in construction and were known for their pleasant scent. The fragrance of the firs adds an element of beauty and delight to the home, suggesting that the relationship is not only strong but also filled with joy and pleasure. In the context of the Song of Solomon, which celebrates romantic love, the fragrant firs can symbolize the refreshing and life-giving aspects of love. The use of natural imagery highlights the connection between creation and the Creator, pointing to the beauty and order God has established in relationships. The mention of "fragrant" may also allude to the pleasing aroma of a life lived in accordance with God's will, as seen in other scriptures where fragrance is associated with worship and sacrifice (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of the Song of Solomon, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom and wealth.
