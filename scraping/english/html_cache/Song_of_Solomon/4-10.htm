The use of "sister" and "bride" reflects the dual nature of the relationship, emphasizing both familial closeness and marital intimacy. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such terms were often used to express deep bonds and commitment. Theologically, this can be seen as a reflection of Christ's love for the Church, where believers are both His family and His bride (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p><b>Your love is much better than wine,</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a symbol of joy, celebration, and abundance. By stating that her love is better than wine, the speaker elevates the beloved's affection above all earthly pleasures and delights. This comparison can be linked to the spiritual joy and fulfillment found in a relationship with God, which surpasses all worldly experiences (<a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>). It also echoes the idea of the new wine of the Kingdom, representing the new covenant in Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>).<p><b>and the fragrance of your perfume than all spices.</b><br>Perfume and spices were highly valued in the ancient world, often used in religious rituals, royal ceremonies, and personal adornment. The mention of fragrance suggests an alluring and captivating presence, much like the incense used in the temple worship (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). This can symbolize the pleasing aroma of a life devoted to God, as seen in the New Testament where believers are described as the fragrance of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>). The comparison to "all spices" indicates the surpassing worth and uniqueness of the beloved's presence and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved.htm">The Beloved</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, often interpreted as Solomon, who is expressing his admiration and love for his bride.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>The recipient of the beloved's affection, representing the church or the individual believer in a spiritual allegory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of the Song of Solomon, representing wisdom and the pursuit of love.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical backdrop of the Song of Solomon, reflecting the customs and poetic expressions of love in the ancient Near East.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding.htm">The Wedding</a></b><br>The context of the celebration of love and union, symbolizing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_supremacy_of_love.htm">The Supremacy of Love</a></b><br>The verse highlights the superiority of love over material pleasures, such as wine.

The Bridegroom opens with sheer enjoyment: &#8220;How delightful is your love.&#8221; Delight is the first note God struck in Eden when He declared creation &#8220;very good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Marriage, when lived in covenant faithfulness, is designed to be a source of gladness&#8212;&#8220;Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also hints at God&#8217;s own joy in His people: &#8220;The LORD your God&#8230;will rejoice over you with singing&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ loves His bride exactly this way: &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my sister, my bride!</b><p>&#8226; The double title blends affection (&#8220;sister&#8221; speaks of family closeness) with covenant commitment (&#8220;bride&#8221; marks the marital bond).<p>&#8226; Scripture often combines these ideas: believers are at once family members and covenant partners with the Lord&#8212;&#8220;Both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same family&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus applied similar language to discipleship: &#8220;Whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-35.htm">Mark 3:35</a>).<p>&#8226; In marriage the terms remind spouses to nurture friendship as well as romance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your love is much better than wine</b><p>&#8226; Wine represents festive pleasure (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Yet the groom says his bride&#8217;s love surpasses it.<p>&#8226; This echoes Songs 1:2: &#8220;Your love is more pleasing than wine.&#8221; The statement intensifies now that the relationship is secure.<p>&#8226; Deep, covenant love brings a joy that outlasts the fleeting lift of wine&#8212;&#8220;You have put more joy in my heart than they have when grain and new wine abound&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, Christ&#8217;s love is the ultimate satisfaction; every earthly marriage points to that greater reality (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the fragrance of your perfume than all spices</b><p>&#8226; Perfume in Scripture signals costly devotion&#8212;think of Mary anointing Jesus: &#8220;The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The bride&#8217;s presence leaves a lingering, pleasing aroma. Likewise, the church is called &#8220;the fragrance of Christ&#8221; in the world (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Aromatic spices once perfumed the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>). The language suggests worship: the union of bride and groom becomes a living sanctuary of praise.<p>&#8226; A God-honoring marriage gives off a spiritual scent more alluring than anything the world can blend.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/songs/4-10.htm">Song of Solomon 4:10</a> paints the bridegroom&#8217;s exuberant praise for his bride: her love brings delight, binds them as intimate family, surpasses every earthly pleasure, and spreads an aroma of costly devotion. In literal marriage the verse calls spouses to cherish, celebrate, and protect covenant love. Spiritually, it foreshadows Christ&#8217;s joyous, surpassing, fragrant love for His redeemed people&#8212;a love in which every believer is invited to rejoice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices! Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</span> The expression of thy love, that is, the endearments, the embraces, are delightful. The allusion to the lips may be a mere amplification of the word "love," but it may also refer to speech, and we think of the nineteenth psalm and the description of the words and testimony of the Lord, "more to be desired than gold, and sweeter than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb" (cf. <a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-7.htm">Hosea 4:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>). The words of pure, inward joy flowing forth from the lips may be so described. So the Lord has said, in <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>, that he rejoiceth over his people as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">delightful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3302.htm">Strong's 3302: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bright, beautiful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] your love,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1465;&#1491;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#333;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yi&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
