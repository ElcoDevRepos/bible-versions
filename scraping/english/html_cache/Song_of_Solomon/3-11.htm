In biblical literature, Zion is a poetic term for Jerusalem, the city of God. The call to "come out" suggests an invitation to witness a significant event, emphasizing the communal aspect of celebration in ancient Israelite culture. The daughters of Zion are often seen as representatives of the people of Israel, and their presence signifies the importance of the occasion.<p><b>and gaze at King Solomon</b><br>King Solomon, the son of David, is a central figure in the Old Testament known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem. The invitation to "gaze" implies admiration and reverence, highlighting Solomon's esteemed status. This moment reflects the grandeur and splendor associated with his reign, which is often seen as a high point in Israel's history. Solomon's kingship is also a type of Christ, representing wisdom and peace.<p><b>wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him</b><br>The mention of Solomon's mother, Bathsheba, crowning him adds a personal and familial dimension to the scene. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the crowning of a king was a significant event, often involving family members. This act symbolizes legitimacy and continuity of the Davidic line. Bathsheba's role underscores the importance of maternal influence and support in royal succession. The crown itself is a symbol of authority and honor.<p><b>on the day of his wedding</b><br>The wedding day is a time of joy and celebration, marking the union of two individuals and the beginning of a new chapter. In the context of Solomon, this could refer to his marriage to Pharaoh's daughter or another significant union. Weddings in ancient Israel were communal events, often lasting several days, and were seen as a reflection of God's covenant relationship with His people. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate marriage between Christ and His Church.<p><b>the day of his heart&#8217;s rejoicing</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the joy and fulfillment found in the covenant of marriage. It reflects the deep emotional and spiritual satisfaction that comes from such a union. In biblical theology, the heart is the center of one's being, encompassing emotions, will, and intellect. Solomon's rejoicing can be seen as a foreshadowing of the joy Christ experiences in His relationship with the Church, His bride. This joy is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughters_of_zion.htm">Daughters of Zion</a></b><br>This term refers to the women of Jerusalem, often symbolizing the people of God.

The Berean Standard Bible says, &#8220;gaze at King Solomon.&#8221;<p>&#8226; To &#8220;gaze&#8221; goes beyond a quick glance&#8212;linger, study, admire. In <a href="/2_chronicles/9-3.htm">2 Chronicles 9:3&#8211;8</a>, the Queen of Sheba gazed at Solomon&#8217;s wisdom and splendor until she was &#8220;overwhelmed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Solomon, Israel&#8217;s wise and glorious king, foreshadows Christ, the greater King (<a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>). <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a> opens with a similar directive: &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God.&#8221; We are called to fix our eyes on Jesus with the same attentive wonder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him</b><p>&#8226; A crown signifies authority and honor (<a href="/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>).

Likewise, the Father publicly affirms the Son at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, seeing the King crowned assures us that God&#8217;s promises of an eternal throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>) stand firm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the day of his wedding</b><p>&#8226; The scene shifts to a wedding, blending royal coronation with marital union.

The verse fuels worship, assuring us that God&#8217;s promises are visible, joyful, and meant to be marveled at together.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/songs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon, with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart</span>. This seems to be an appeal to a larger company of those who will rejoice in the bride and her happiness. The daughters of Zion are perhaps intended to represent the people generally as distinguished from the ladies of the court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let all the people rejoice in their king and in his royal bride. The mention of the royal mother seems to point to the beginning of Solomon's reign as the time referred to. The crown, or chaplet, with which the proud mother adorned her son, was the fresh wreath round a young king's head, a wedding coronet, no doubt made of gold and silver. It was not the crown placed on the head of Pharaoh's daughter, which would not be so spoken cf. According to the Talmud, the custom remained even to later times. There can be no doubt of Bathsheba's special delight in Solomon (see <a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13</a>). We must not, of course, push too far the typical interpretation of such language, which may be taken as the poetical form rather than the spiritual substance. And yet there may be an allusion, in the joy and pride of Bathsheba in her son's gladness, and the consummation of his nuptial bliss, to the Incarnation and the crowning glory of a Divine humanity, which is at once the essential fact of redemption, and the bright expectation which, on the head of the Saviour, lights up eternity to the faith of his people. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/songs/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Come out,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1447;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;
