The Cushites were known for their formidable military strength. This event occurs during the reign of Asa, king of Judah, highlighting a period of relative peace and reform in Judah that is suddenly threatened by an external force. The mention of Zerah underscores the historical reality of foreign invasions faced by the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<p><b>with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots</b><br>The size of Zerah's army is described as immense, emphasizing the overwhelming odds faced by Asa and his forces. The use of chariots indicates advanced military technology, as chariots were a significant advantage in ancient warfare, providing speed and power. This detail highlights the severity of the threat and sets the stage for a miraculous deliverance, as seen in other biblical narratives where God intervenes on behalf of His people against overwhelming odds (e.g., Gideon's victory in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>).<p><b>and they advanced as far as Mareshah</b><br>Mareshah was a city in the lowlands of Judah, strategically located on a major route connecting the coastal plain with the hill country.

The geographical reference underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for divine intervention.

His incursion will spotlight the faith of Asa and the faithfulness of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came against them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; refers to Judah and King Asa&#8217;s forces, who had just fortified their cities (2 Chron 14:7). The timing highlights how obedience and preparation do not exempt God&#8217;s people from attack (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;came against&#8221; paints a purposeful invasion, like the earlier assault of Shishak (2 Chron 12:2&#8211;3). This is spiritual as well as military opposition, echoing <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p>&#8226; God permits the conflict to test and refine His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>), proving that His past deliverances are foundations for fresh faith, not relics to be admired from a distance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots</b><p>&#8226; One million soldiers and three hundred chariots dwarf Judah&#8217;s combined 580,000 troops (2 Chron 14:8). The writer wants us to feel the impossibility&#8212;much like Gideon versus the Midianites &#8220;as numerous as locusts&#8221; (<a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>) or Hezekiah against Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Chariots were the ancient equivalent of armored divisions (<a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>). Against foot soldiers, 300 chariots signal crushing speed and power.<p>&#8226; Scripture records such staggering numbers to magnify the Lord&#8217;s deliverance. When Asa prays, &#8220;LORD, there is no one besides You to help the powerless against the mighty&#8221; (2 Chron 14:11), the statistics prove his point&#8212;only God can tip these scales.<p>&#8226; Later, the prophet Hanani will remind Asa, &#8220;Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD, He delivered them into your hand&#8221; (2 Chron 16:8). History is meant to coach future trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they advanced as far as Mareshah</b><p>&#8226; Mareshah sat on Judah&#8217;s western frontier (2 Chron 11:8), controlling key trade routes. The enemy&#8217;s reach to this fortified city shows how deeply the incursion penetrated.<p>&#8226; God allows Judah&#8217;s defenses to be tested at Mareshah so Asa must leave the safety of fortified walls and meet Zerah in open battle at the Valley of Zephathah (2 Chron 14:10). Faith often requires stepping onto the field, not hiding behind preparations (<a href="/2_samuel/23-9.htm">2 Samuel 23:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The march to Mareshah anticipates Micah&#8217;s later lament, &#8220;I will bring a conqueror against you, residents of Mareshah&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>). Geography becomes theology: places of apparent strength can fall unless the Lord shields them (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9</a> portrays a very real crisis: a distant Ethiopian commander, a colossal army, iron chariots, and an advance to the strategic city of Mareshah. By recording the overwhelming odds, Scripture sets the stage for God&#8217;s overpowering rescue. The verse teaches that threats may come suddenly, size and technology may favor the enemy, and even fortified places can be breached&#8212;but when God&#8217;s people rely on Him, numbers and chariots cannot stand against His might.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Against them.</span>--Against the army described in last verse.

Zerah is identified with Osorchon II., hieroglyphic Uasarken, who succeeded Shishak as king of Egypt. The name of this king is curiously like that of Sargon, the great Assyrian conqueror of the eighth century. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,">2Chronicles 12:2</a><span class= "ital">.</span>) The object of the expedition appears to have been to bring Judah again under the yoke of Egypt. Shishak had made Rehoboam tributary (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-8.htm" title="Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.">2Chronicles 12:8</a>), after reducing his fortresses and plundering Jerusalem. But now Asa had restored the defences of his country, and apparently reorganised the fighting material; steps indicating a desire for national independence. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-15.</span> - The remaining seven verses of this chapter are occupied with the account of the invasion of <span class="accented">Zerah the Ethiopian</span>, and the successful defence and reprisals of Asa. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zerah the Ethiopian</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, the "Ethiopian," Greek and Septuagint rendering for "Cushite." In its vaguest dimensions Ethiopia, or Cush, designated Africa south of Egypt, but more concisely it meant the lands we now call Nubia, Sennaar, Kordefan, and part of Abyssinia. And these, roughly speaking, were bounded north, south, east, and west respectively by Egypt and Syene, Abyssinia, Red Sea, and Libyan Desert. When, however, Ethiopia proper is spoken of, the name probably designates the kingdom of Meroe (<span class="accented">Seba</span>, <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); and the Assyrian inscriptions make the Cushite name of the deified Nimrod <span class="accented">one with</span> Meroe), which was so closely associated at different times with Egypt, that sometimes an Egypt king swayed it (as e.g. some eighteen hundred years before <span class="accented">Shishak</span>, Sesostris fourth king of the twelfth dynasty), and sometimes <span class="accented">vice versa</span> (as e.g. the three Ethiopian kings of the twenty-fifth dynasty - Shabak (<span class="accented">Sabakhou</span>), Sethos (<span class="accented">Sebechos</span>), and Tarkos (<span class="accented">Tirhakah</span>), whose reigning dates as between Ethiopia and Egypt are not yet certified). The name thus confined covers an irregular circular bulk of country between "the modern Khartoum, where the <span class="accented">Astapus</span> joins the true Nile, and the influx of the <span class="accented">Astaboras</span>, into their united stream." From the language of Diodorus (1:23), harmonized conjecturally with Strabo (18:821), the region may be counted as 375 miles in circumference and 125 miles in the diameter of the erratic circle, its extreme south point being variously stated, distant from Syene, 873 miles (Pliny, 6:29. &sect; 33); or, according to Mannert's book ('Geogr. d. Alt.,' 10:183), 600 miles by the assertion of Artemidorns, or 625 by that of Eratosthenes. Thence the "Cushite" extended probably to the Euphrates and the Tigris, and through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia. Some, however, think that the Cushite now intended was the Ethiopian of <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, who had settlement near Gerar (Dr. Jamieson, in 'Comm.') as a nomadic horde. Dr. Jamieson quotes Bruce's 'Travels' to support this view, which seems a most improbable, not to say impossible, one nevertheless. The question as to the people intended will perhaps best be found in the solution of the question for whom the name of their king stands (see following note). Zerah. Hebrew as above. It is noteworthy that the four previous occurrences of this name - <a href="/genesis/36-13.htm">Genesis 36:13</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-37.htm">1 Chronicles 1:37</a>, son of Reuel, grandson of Esau; <a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, son of Judah and Tumor; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, son of Simeon; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-6.htm">1 Chronicles 5:6, 26</a>, Hebrew text, son of Iddo, a Gershonite Levite - show it as the name of an Israelite, or descendant of Shem. Our present <span class="accented">Zerah</span> is a <span class="accented">Cushite</span>, or descendant of Ham. The Septuagint forms of the name are <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or (Alexandrian) <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Although Professor Dr. Murphy says ('Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 116) that "it is plain that Zerah was a sovereign of Kush, who in the reign of Takeloth, about <span class="date">B.C. 944</span>, invaded Egypt and penetrated into Asia," the balance of probability, both from the names themselves and the synchronisms of history, corroborated by the composition of Zerah's army (Cushim and Lubim, <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>) and some other tributary considerations, is that our <span class="accented">Zerah</span> was Usarken II., the fourth king of the twenty-second dynasty (or possibly Usarken I., the second king of the dynasty). The invasion of the text was probably in Asa's fourteenth year, his reign thus far being dated <span class="date">B.C. 953-940</span> (or <span class="date">B.C. 933-920</span> if Manasseh's be taken at only thirty-five instead of fifty-five years). The alleged army of this Zerah was an Egyptian army, largely made of mercenaries (compare the description of Shishak's army, ch. 12:3). The present defeat of Zerah would go far to explain the known decline of the Egyptian power at just this date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some twenty-five to thirty years after Shishak. At the same time, it must be admitted that it is not possible to identify with certainty Zerah with either Usarken. Whether he is an unknown Arabian Cushite, or an unknown African Cushite of Ethiopia-above-Egypt, or one of the Usarkens, has yet to be pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">Mareshah</span> (see our note, <a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). It lay the "second mile" (Eusebius and Jerome) south of Eleutheropolis and between Hebron (1 Maccabees 5:36; 2 Maccabees 12:35) and Ashdod (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. &sect; 6). The mention of the valley of Zephathah in the following verse will half identify its exact position. It is probable that Dr. Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:67) and Toblev in his interesting , Dritto Wand.' (pp. 129, 142), have reliably fixed the site one Roman mile south-west of the modern <span class="accented">Beit-Jibrin.</span> Mareshah is again mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a> and <a href="/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>, as quoted already, in references interesting to be consulted. A thousand thousand. Whether this number be correct or not, it may be noted that it is the largest alleged number of an army given in the Old Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Zerah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(ze&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2226.htm">Strong's 2226: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zerah -- three Israelites, also an Edomite, also an Ethiopian</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Cushite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#363;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
