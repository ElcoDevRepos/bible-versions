The use of "LORD God" reflects the Hebrew names Yahweh and Elohim, emphasizing God's eternal nature and His role as Creator and Sustainer. This invocation is a common way to address God in prayer, showing reverence and submission.<p><b>let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled</b><br>This refers to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule Israel forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon, as David's son, is invoking this promise, seeking its continuation and fulfillment. This covenant is significant in biblical history as it points to the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the promise of an eternal kingdom.<p><b>For You have made me king</b><br>Solomon acknowledges that his kingship is ordained by God, not by human effort or merit. This reflects the biblical principle that all authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Solomon's recognition of God's sovereignty over his position sets a tone of humility and dependence on divine guidance.<p><b>over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth</b><br>This phrase echoes God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth. It highlights the fulfillment of God's promises and the growth of the nation of Israel.

His first word is &#8220;Now,&#8221; signaling that he is stepping into God&#8217;s presence in real time&#8212;no delay, no formality, just immediate dependence. He addresses the covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (Yahweh) and affirms God as &#8220;God,&#8221; the supreme Ruler.<p>- This echoes David&#8217;s own prayers (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-10.htm">1 Chronicles 29:10&#8211;12</a>) where David blessed &#8220;the LORD, the God of Israel.&#8221;<p>- Solomon follows the pattern of Moses, who also began intercession by focusing on who God is before asking anything (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11</a>).<p>- In humble recognition, Solomon mirrors the psalmist&#8217;s awe: &#8220;O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>).<p>Acknowledging God first sets the tone: every request that follows rests on God&#8217;s character and faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s request is anchored in covenant history, not personal ambition. He does not ask for a new promise; he asks God to honor the one already spoken to David.<p>- God had sworn, &#8220;I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). Solomon claims that word.<p>- David reminded Solomon of the same pledge as his final charge (<a href="/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>).<p>- By basing his plea on God&#8217;s earlier commitment, Solomon shows confidence that what God has said, God will do (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>This section teaches that prayer becomes powerful when it rests on promises God has already revealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For You have made me king</b><p>Solomon recognizes his throne is God-given, not man-made.<p>- Nathan the prophet had anointed him at God&#8217;s direction (<a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm">1 Kings 1:34</a>), making divine appointment unmistakable.<p>- Scripture insists, &#8220;There is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Solomon embraces that truth.<p>- He also echoes his earlier admission, &#8220;I am but a little child&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>), underscoring dependence on God for wisdom and strength.<p>By acknowledging God&#8217;s hand in his position, Solomon models humility for every leader.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth</b><p>The king sees Israel&#8217;s vast population as fulfillment of ancient promise.<p>- God told Abraham, &#8220;I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>), and repeated it to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p>- Moses observed, &#8220;The LORD your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as numerous as the stars in the sky&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a> celebrates that what God promised Abraham has come to pass. Solomon now carries that promise forward.<p>Recognizing Israel&#8217;s size reminds Solomon that leading such a multitude requires divine wisdom&#8212;setting up the very next verses where he requests it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/1-9.htm">2 Chronicles 1:9</a> captures Solomon&#8217;s heart at the dawn of his reign. He approaches God first, stands on God&#8217;s promises, acknowledges God&#8217;s placement, and recognizes the magnitude of the people entrusted to him. The verse teaches us to ground every request in who God is, what He has pledged, and the responsibilities He has assigned, confident that the faithful God who kept His word to David and Abraham will keep it still.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established.</span>--A reminiscence of <a href="/1_chronicles/17-23.htm" title="Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as you have said.">1Chronicles 17:23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span>--<span class= "ital">Over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.</span> This last clause freely corresponds with <a href="/1_kings/3-8.htm" title="And your servant is in the middle of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.">1Kings 3:8</a>.
