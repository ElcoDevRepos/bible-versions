The priests mentioned here were those who served at the high places, which were unauthorized worship sites often associated with idol worship. By burning their bones on the altars, Josiah was fulfilling the prophecy given by a man of God during the reign of Jeroboam I (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). This act symbolized the complete desecration and defilement of these altars, rendering them unusable for future idolatrous practices. It was a radical step to ensure that the worship of Yahweh was not mixed with pagan practices. This action also highlights the seriousness with which Josiah approached the covenantal laws, emphasizing the need for exclusive worship of the God of Israel.<p><b>So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</b><br>The cleansing of Judah and Jerusalem signifies a comprehensive religious reform that Josiah undertook to restore proper worship. This involved not only the destruction of idolatrous altars and high places but also the removal of all elements associated with pagan worship, including idols, Asherah poles, and other cultic objects. Josiah's reforms were in line with the Deuteronomic law, which called for the centralization of worship in Jerusalem and the eradication of idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>). This cleansing was both physical and spiritual, aiming to renew the covenant relationship between God and His people. It also prefigures the ultimate cleansing from sin that would be accomplished through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets. Josiah's actions serve as a type of Christ, pointing to the future Messiah who would purify His people and establish true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and cleanse the land of idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, where Josiah focused his reform efforts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatrous_priests.htm">Idolatrous Priests</a></b><br>The priests who served at the high places and altars dedicated to false gods, whose bones were burned by Josiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>The places of worship for idols, which Josiah desecrated by burning the bones of the idolatrous priests upon them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/religious_reforms.htm">Religious Reforms</a></b><br>The actions taken by Josiah to purify the worship practices in Judah and Jerusalem, including the destruction of idolatrous sites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_purity.htm">Zeal for Purity</a></b><br>Josiah's actions demonstrate a fervent commitment to purifying worship and eradicating idolatry.
