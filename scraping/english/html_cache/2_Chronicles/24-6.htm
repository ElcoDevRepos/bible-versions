Jehoiada played a crucial role in Joash's rise to power, having protected him as a child and orchestrated his coronation. This relationship underscores the king's reliance on Jehoiada for spiritual and religious guidance. The high priest held significant influence in religious and political matters, reflecting the theocratic nature of Israelite society where religious leaders often guided kings.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties, including the care of the temple and conducting sacrifices. They were responsible for collecting offerings and tithes from the people. Judah and Jerusalem, being the southern kingdom and its capital, were central to the religious life of the Israelites. The king's question implies a lapse in religious duties, highlighting the importance of maintaining temple worship and the support of the Levites, which was essential for the spiritual health of the nation.<p><b>the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD</b><br>This refers to the half-shekel tax instituted by Moses in <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, intended for the maintenance of the Tabernacle, which later applied to the Temple. Moses, as the servant of the LORD, established laws that were foundational for Israelite worship and community life. This tax was a means of ensuring that the worship of God remained central and that the physical structure of worship was maintained. It also served as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and by the assembly of Israel</b><br>The assembly of Israel refers to the collective decision-making body of the Israelites, often involving elders and leaders. This indicates that the tax was not only a divine command but also had communal approval and support. It reflects the cooperative nature of Israelite society in matters of worship and religious duty, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the people to uphold God's commands.<p><b>for the Tent of the Testimony?&#8221;</b><br>The Tent of the Testimony, or the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites before the construction of the Temple. It housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the tablets of the Law. The reference to the Tent of the Testimony connects the current temple practices back to the wilderness period, emphasizing continuity in worship and the enduring presence of God with His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the true Tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the restoration of the temple.

In each of those instances the Hebrew text shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and the Authorized Version "chief" except inconsistently in our ver. 11. Revised Version "chief" in all the instances. The name "priest" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title "high" or "chief priest" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, the last <a href="/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences.

In these last two cases, however (<a href="/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24, 29</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), it is not "high priests" nor "chief priests" that are perhaps even really intended, but the "princes" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were <span class="accented">chief. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem</span>. The statement here is precise, that the call of money was to be made both in the cities of Judah and in the metropolis Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">collection</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; Revised Version, better, <span class="accented">the tax of, etc.</span> Of this we read in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-15</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-30.htm">Numbers 1:30</a>.

This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply <span class="accented">recusant</span> priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by "scribe" and high priest" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/24-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
