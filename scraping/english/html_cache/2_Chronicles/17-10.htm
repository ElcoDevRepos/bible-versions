The "dread of the LORD" refers to a supernatural fear instilled by God, reminiscent of the fear that fell upon the Canaanites during Israel's conquest of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). This fear is not merely psychological but a manifestation of God's power and presence, ensuring peace for Judah. Historically, the surrounding kingdoms included nations like Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia, which often posed threats to Israel and Judah. Theologically, this demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to protect His people without the need for military intervention.<p><b>so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat</b><br>Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, was known for his religious reforms and dedication to following God's commandments (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>). His reign was marked by a period of peace and prosperity, largely attributed to his faithfulness and God's favor. The absence of war during his reign is significant, as it allowed for spiritual and economic growth within Judah. This peace can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to protect and bless those who are obedient to Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-7</a>). Theologically, Jehoshaphat's experience prefigures the peace that Christ, the Prince of Peace, brings to His followers, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of the Israelites, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/surrounding_kingdoms.htm">Surrounding Kingdoms</a></b><br>Neighboring nations around Judah, which were often in conflict with Israel and Judah but were deterred from attacking during Jehoshaphat's reign due to the fear of the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Power of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's commitment to God led to divine protection.
