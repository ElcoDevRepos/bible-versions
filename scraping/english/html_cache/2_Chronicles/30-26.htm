This rejoicing is tied to the celebration of the Passover, which King Hezekiah reinstated after a period of neglect. The Passover was a pivotal feast in Jewish tradition, commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. The great rejoicing suggests a spiritual revival and a return to covenant faithfulness. The city of Jerusalem, as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, was the appropriate setting for such a celebration, emphasizing the importance of communal worship and unity.<p><b>for nothing like this had happened there since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the extraordinary nature of the event by comparing it to the time of Solomon, known for his wisdom and the construction of the First Temple. Solomon's reign was marked by peace and prosperity, and the dedication of the Temple was a high point in Israel's history. The comparison suggests that the Passover celebration under Hezekiah was unparalleled in its grandeur and spiritual significance since that golden age. It underscores Hezekiah's role in restoring proper worship and the people's enthusiastic response. This also reflects a longing for the unity and faithfulness of the united monarchy under David and Solomon, contrasting with the divided kingdom's struggles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship for the Israelites, where the temple was located.
