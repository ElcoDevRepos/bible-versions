The queen of Sheba, likely from the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia, represents the far-reaching influence of Solomon's reputation. Her journey signifies the international recognition of Solomon's God-given wisdom, which was not only intellectual but also practical, as seen in his governance and judicial decisions. This encounter fulfills the promise of God to Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, where God grants him unparalleled wisdom. The queen's visit also prefigures the Gentiles' recognition of the wisdom of Christ, as Jesus refers to this event in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, indicating that He is greater than Solomon.<p><b>the palace he had built</b><br>Solomon's palace, part of a larger complex that included the Temple, was a testament to his wealth, architectural skill, and the prosperity of Israel during his reign. The construction of the palace took thirteen years, as detailed in <a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7:1-12</a>, and it was known for its grandeur and opulence. The palace served as a symbol of the stability and peace that characterized Solomon's rule, fulfilling the promise of rest from enemies given to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>. The architectural achievements of Solomon's era reflect the cultural and economic zenith of Israel, and the palace itself can be seen as a type of the heavenly kingdom, with its splendor pointing to the eternal reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from a wealthy and distant land, often associated with the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.
