This timing is significant because the Passover was traditionally celebrated in the first month, Nisan. However, due to the unpreparedness of the people and the priests, King Hezekiah decided to hold the Passover in the second month, as allowed by the law in <a href="/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10-11</a> for those who were unclean or on a journey during the first month. This decision reflects Hezekiah's desire to restore proper worship and his understanding of the law's provisions for exceptional circumstances.<p><b>a very great assembly</b><br>The phrase indicates a large gathering of people, suggesting widespread participation and interest in the religious reforms initiated by King Hezekiah. This assembly included not only the people of Judah but also remnants from the northern kingdom of Israel, which had recently fallen to Assyria. The gathering signifies a moment of unity and revival among the Israelites, transcending the division between the northern and southern kingdoms. It highlights the people's collective desire to return to the worship of Yahweh and to seek His favor.<p><b>gathered in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, was the designated place for the celebration of the major feasts according to <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>. The city's significance is rooted in its status as the location of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The gathering in Jerusalem underscores the centrality of the Temple in Israelite worship and the importance of communal participation in religious observances. It also foreshadows the eschatological gathering of all nations to Jerusalem, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>.<p><b>to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread</b><br>The Feast of Unleavened Bread is closely associated with Passover, commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their deliverance from slavery. It is a seven-day festival that begins on the 15th day of Nisan, immediately following Passover. The feast involves the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing the purging of sin and the pursuit of holiness. In this context, the celebration represents a renewal of covenant faithfulness and a return to the foundational events of Israel's identity as God's chosen people. The feast also typologically points to Jesus Christ, the sinless "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), who delivers believers from the bondage of sin through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the celebration of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, seeking to restore proper worship and obedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the temple was located and where the assembly gathered for the feast.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">The Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival that follows Passover, commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>A large gathering of people from Judah and Israel who responded to Hezekiah's call to return to the Lord and celebrate the feast.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_month.htm">The Second Month</a></b><br>The timing of the celebration, which was unusual as Passover was typically celebrated in the first month, but allowances were made due to the unpreparedness of the priests and the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_of_worship.htm">Restoration of Worship</a></b><br>Hezekiah's actions demonstrate the importance of returning to true worship and obedience to God's commands.
