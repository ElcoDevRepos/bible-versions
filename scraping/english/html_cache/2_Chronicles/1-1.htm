His lineage is significant as it fulfills God's promise to David that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon's birth is a testament to God's grace, as he was born after the tumultuous events surrounding David and Bathsheba. His name, meaning "peace," reflects the era of peace and prosperity that characterized his reign. Solomon is also a type of Christ, as both are seen as kings of peace and wisdom.<p><b>established himself securely over his kingdom</b><br>Solomon's establishment over the kingdom signifies a period of stability and consolidation of power. This was not an automatic process; it involved political acumen and divine favor. The transition of power from David to Solomon was marked by challenges, including rival claims to the throne by Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-53</a>). Solomon's secure establishment is a fulfillment of God's promise to David and a reflection of divine providence in the governance of Israel.<p><b>and the LORD his God was with him</b><br>The presence of the LORD with Solomon is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, indicating divine approval and support. This phrase echoes the covenantal relationship between God and the kings of Israel, where obedience to God's commandments results in divine favor. The LORD's presence with Solomon is reminiscent of God's promise to be with David and his descendants (<a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3-4</a>). It underscores the importance of faithfulness to God for the success of a ruler.<p><b>and highly exalted him</b><br>Solomon's exaltation is both a divine act and a recognition of his wisdom and leadership. His exaltation is seen in the wealth, wisdom, and influence he attained, making him renowned among the nations (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-24</a>). This exaltation is a precursor to the ultimate exaltation of Jesus Christ, who is the greater Son of David, exalted above all (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).

But the verb in its present form (hithp. conjugation) is found in Chronicles, omitting other books, just fifteen times, and rarely, if ever, to the level of the mere passive voice.
