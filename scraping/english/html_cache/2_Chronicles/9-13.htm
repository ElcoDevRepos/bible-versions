Solomon's annual income of gold signifies the peak of Israel's economic power and influence during his rule. The accumulation of wealth was a fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>, where God grants him riches and honor. This wealth also reflects the extensive trade networks and alliances Solomon established, particularly with nations like Tyre and Sheba, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/9.htm">2 Chronicles 9</a>.<p><b>was 666 talents,</b><br>The specific number, 666 talents, is significant and has sparked much discussion. A talent was a large unit of weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, making 666 talents an enormous amount of gold. This figure underscores Solomon's unparalleled wealth but also serves as a point of caution. The number 666 is later associated with imperfection and human fallibility in <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>, where it is the number of the beast. This connection may suggest a subtle warning about the potential for wealth and power to lead to spiritual decline, as seen in Solomon's later years when he turned away from God (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). Solomon's wealth, while a blessing, also foreshadows the dangers of materialism and idolatry, themes that resonate throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.
