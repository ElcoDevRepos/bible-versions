The term "worthless and wicked" is often used in the Old Testament to describe individuals who act against God's will, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a> regarding Eli's sons. These men likely sought personal gain and power, exploiting the political instability following Solomon's death. Their gathering around Jeroboam suggests a deliberate and organized rebellion, reminiscent of other biblical accounts where leaders are surrounded by corrupt advisors, such as Absalom's rebellion against David.<p><b>to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon</b><br>Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, inherited the throne of Judah. His reign marked the division of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. The resistance against Rehoboam was a significant event, as it fulfilled the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah in <a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>, where the kingdom would be torn from Solomon's line due to idolatry. This resistance was not merely political but also spiritual, as it reflected the people's turning away from the Davidic covenant.<p><b>when he was young, inexperienced, and unable to resist them</b><br>Rehoboam's youth and inexperience are critical factors in understanding his failure to maintain the unity of the kingdom. His inability to resist the rebellion is contrasted with the wisdom and strength of his father, Solomon. This situation underscores the importance of wise counsel and leadership, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which states that victory is found in an abundance of counselors. Rehoboam's failure to heed the advice of the elders, opting instead for the counsel of his peers, led to the division of the kingdom, illustrating the consequences of poor leadership and decision-making.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by division and conflict.

The verse urges us to value righteous companions, respect legitimate leaders, and cultivate maturity so we&#8217;re not &#8220;unable to resist&#8221; when evil gathers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And there are gathered.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">are.</span><p><span class= "bld">Vain men</span> (<span class= "ital">r?qim,</span> <a href="/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4</a>; <a href="/judges/11-3.htm" title="Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelled in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.">Judges 11:3</a>).--Said of the followers of Abimelech and the freebooter Jephthah. Neither this nor the following phrase, "the children of Belial" (literally, <span class= "ital">sons of worthlessness, i.e.,</span> men of low character and estimation) occurs again in the Chronicles. (See <a href="/judges/19-22.htm" title="Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him.">Judges 19:22</a>; <a href="/judges/20-13.htm" title="Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.

The aorist tense is needed for the rendering in both these cases; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "And vain men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against him." <span class="cmt_word">Vain men</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This word, and one very slightly different in form, and their adverb, occur in all forty-one times; rendered in the Authorized Version "empty" nineteen times, "vain" eighteen times, and "without cause," "to no purpose," and "void" the remaining four times. It is the word that is used of the "empty" pit of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>); of the "empty ears" of corn (<a href="/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>); of "empty" pitchers and other vessels (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>). And in all the other cases expresses metaphorically the emptiness of head, of heart, or of reason, with the same simple force of language appropriate, it appears, then as now. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Belial</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>. This word is found twenty-seven times, and, including seven marginal options, is rendered in the Authorized Version "Belial" twenty-three times; the four exceptions being "wicked" three times, and "naughty" once. The derivation of it marks the one expressive meaning of "without profit." <span class="cmt_word">Young and tender-hearted</span>. Hard as it is to put these objections to the credit of a man forty-one years of age (see our note, <a href="/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>) at all, yet, if so, they can only be explained as some do explain them, of a blamable ignorance, inexperience, and instability. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then worthless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7386.htm">Strong's 7386: </a> </span><span class="str2">Empty, worthless</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1100.htm">Strong's 1100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Without profit, worthlessness, destruction, wickedness </span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gathered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
