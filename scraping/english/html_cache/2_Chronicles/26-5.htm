This highlights the importance of godly mentorship and leadership. Zechariah's role was crucial in guiding Uzziah, emphasizing the biblical principle that leaders should seek wise counsel (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). The historical context shows that during this period, Judah experienced relative peace and prosperity, which can be attributed to Uzziah's faithfulness in seeking God.<p><b>who instructed him in the fear of God</b><br>Zechariah's instruction in the fear of God underscores the biblical theme that wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not about being afraid but having reverence and awe for God's holiness and authority. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed high value on the role of prophets and priests in teaching and maintaining the covenant relationship with God. This instruction would have included adherence to the Law and the importance of worship and obedience.<p><b>And as long as he sought the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates a conditional relationship between Uzziah's actions and God's blessings. The biblical narrative often shows that seeking God leads to divine favor and guidance (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>). The historical context of Uzziah's reign, which was marked by military success and economic growth, reflects the blessings that come from seeking God. This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, where seeking God is associated with finding life and prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>).<p><b>God gave him success</b><br>The success given by God to Uzziah is a testament to the covenantal promises found in the Old Testament, where obedience to God results in blessings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). Uzziah's success included military victories, architectural achievements, and agricultural advancements, which are documented in the surrounding chapters. This success can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly sought the Father and achieved ultimate victory over sin and death, offering spiritual success to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who began his reign at the age of 16 and ruled for 52 years.

The moment the king ceased to seek, the blessings ceased.

"who had understanding (or <span class= "ital">gave instruction</span>) in the fear of God." So the famous Rabbis, Rashi and Kimchi, long since suggested. Zechariah was thus the guide and counsellor of king Uzziah, and that not only in religious matters, but in what we should call the political sphere; for in those days the distinction between things sacred and secular, civil and ecclesiastical, between Church and State, religion and common life, was wholly unknown.<p><span class= "bld">And as long as he sought.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">in the days of his seeking.</span><p><span class= "bld">The Lord, God</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Such a mode of speech reveals the chronicler's own hand.<p>Instead of this verse, <a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm" title="Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.">2Kings 15:4</a> makes the deduction usual in its estimate of the character of a reign: "Only the high places were not taken away; the people still used to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places."<p>The power and prosperity of Uzziah are accounted for by the chronicler on the ground that he sought God during the life of Zechariah; although afterwards he offended by rashly intruding upon the priest's office, and was punished with leprosy (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2Chronicles 26:16-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Zechariah</span>.
