In the context of ancient Judah, such an assembly would have included not only soldiers but also civilians, reflecting a united front against the Assyrian threat. This unity is reminiscent of other biblical instances where the people of God come together for a common purpose, such as in Nehemiah's rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem.<p><b>and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land.</b><br>The strategic decision to stop up water sources was a common military tactic in ancient times to deprive invading armies of essential resources. Archaeological evidence from the region supports the existence of numerous water systems, including Hezekiah's Tunnel, which was part of the broader effort to secure water for Jerusalem while denying it to the Assyrians. This act of blocking water sources is a demonstration of wisdom and foresight, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, which emphasizes preparation in the face of conflict.<p><b>&#8220;Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?&#8221; they said.</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the strategic thinking of King Hezekiah and his advisors. The Assyrian Empire, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies, relied heavily on local resources during campaigns. By denying them water, Judah aimed to weaken the Assyrian forces. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God providing wisdom to His people to outmaneuver their enemies, as seen in the story of Gideon in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.
