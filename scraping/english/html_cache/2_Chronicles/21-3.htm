The gifts of silver, gold, and precious things signify wealth and status, reflecting the prosperity of the kingdom under Jehoshaphat's reign. This distribution of wealth can be seen as a means to ensure the loyalty and support of the king's other sons, potentially preventing disputes over succession. The mention of "silver and gold" echoes the wealth of Solomon's era (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-25</a>), indicating a continuity of prosperity in Judah.<p><b>as well as the fortified cities in Judah</b><br>The allocation of fortified cities to Jehoshaphat's sons suggests a strategic move to maintain control and defense over the region. Fortified cities were crucial for protection against invasions and internal rebellions. This practice of assigning cities to royal family members can be seen in other biblical accounts, such as the division of land among the tribes of Israel (Joshua 19). The fortified cities in Judah would have been significant centers of power and influence, underscoring the importance of maintaining a strong defense network.<p><b>but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn</b><br>The transfer of the kingdom to Jehoram as the firstborn reflects the principle of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits the throne. This practice was common in ancient monarchies and is seen throughout the biblical narrative, though not without exceptions (e.g., Jacob over Esau, <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Jehoram's ascension to the throne aligns with the cultural and legal expectations of the time, despite his later actions that led to negative consequences for Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4-20</a>).
