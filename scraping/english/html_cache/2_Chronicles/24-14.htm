The restoration was initiated by King Joash under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest. This completion signifies a return to proper worship and reverence for God&#8217;s house, highlighting the importance of maintaining the sanctity of places dedicated to God.<p><b>they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada</b><br>The collection of money was initially gathered for the repair of the temple. The fact that there was money left over indicates careful management and possibly the generosity of the people. King Joash and Jehoiada, the high priest, were responsible for overseeing the use of these funds, demonstrating a partnership between the monarchy and the priesthood in spiritual and civic matters.<p><b>and with it were made articles for the house of the LORD</b><br>The remaining funds were used to create new articles for the temple, replacing those that had been lost or desecrated. This act of restoration not only repaired the physical structure but also restored the proper tools for worship, emphasizing the importance of having dedicated and consecrated items for the service of God.<p><b>utensils for the service and for the burnt offerings</b><br>These utensils were essential for the daily operations and rituals conducted in the temple. The burnt offerings were a central aspect of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. The restoration of these utensils signifies a renewal of proper worship practices and adherence to the laws given in the Torah.<p><b>dishes, and other objects of gold and silver</b><br>The use of gold and silver for these objects reflects the value and honor given to the worship of God. These materials were often used in the construction of sacred items, as seen in the tabernacle and Solomon&#8217;s temple, symbolizing purity and divine glory.<p><b>Throughout the days of Jehoiada</b><br>Jehoiada&#8217;s influence was significant during his lifetime, as he was a godly leader who guided King Joash in the ways of the Lord. His presence ensured that the worship practices were maintained according to God&#8217;s commandments. This highlights the impact of righteous leadership on the spiritual health of a nation.<p><b>burnt offerings were presented regularly in the house of the LORD</b><br>Regular burnt offerings were a sign of ongoing devotion and obedience to God&#8217;s commands. This regularity indicates a period of spiritual renewal and faithfulness among the people of Judah.

For "vessels of ministering," comp. <a href="/numbers/4-12.htm" title="And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:">Numbers 4:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Spoons.</span>--Cups or <span class= "ital">bowls</span> (<span class= "ital">kappoth,</span> <a href="/exodus/25-29.htm" title="And you shall make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover with: of pure gold shall you make them.">Exodus 25:29</a>).<p>The chronicler apparently reverses the statement of <a href="/context/2_kings/12-13.htm" title="However, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:">2Kings 12:13-14</a>, "<span class= "ital">Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord,</span> bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, <span class= "ital">any vessels of gold or vessels of silver</span> of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord. But they gave (<span class= "ital">used to give</span>) that to the workmen, and repaired (<span class= "ital">used to repair</span>) therewith the house of the Lord." The solution of the difficulty may be found in the fact that the writer of Kings is relating what was done with the money so long as the repairs of the Temple were in progress, while the chronicler is accounting for the surplus after the restoration was complete. Still the appearance of contradiction is sufficiently curious, and suggests the influence of the <span class= "ital">didactic</span> aims of the later historian.<p><span class= "bld">And they offered.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they were offering, i.e.,</span> offered habitually, as a matter of regular observance (the same construction as in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-12.htm" title="And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:12</a>, "they were hiring"). The legal ritual was duly carried out in the Temple so long as the influence of Jehoiada was paramount--a remark peculiar to the chronicler. On the other hand, the present writer omits what is stated in closing the account of the Temple repairs (<a href="/context/2_kings/12-15.htm" title="Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.">2Kings 12:15-16</a>). There we are told that no reckoning was made with the overseers of the workmen in respect of the moneys entrusted to them, "for they dealt faithfully." It is added that the priests still received the trespass and sin money. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to offer</span> withal.
