The foreign men, or "aliens," were non-Israelites residing in the land, often as laborers or servants. This census was likely for organizing labor for Solomon's extensive building projects, including the Temple. The presence of foreign workers highlights Israel's interactions with surrounding nations and the integration of diverse peoples within its borders.<p><b>following the census his father David had conducted</b><br>David's earlier census, recorded in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, was also aimed at organizing labor for the preparation of the Temple. However, David's census in <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a> was met with divine disapproval due to his motives, which were seen as prideful. In contrast, Solomon's census appears to be more pragmatic, focusing on the practical needs of his kingdom. This distinction underscores the importance of intention and purpose in leadership and governance.<p><b>and there were found to be 153,600 in all</b><br>The specific number of 153,600 foreign men indicates a significant population of non-Israelites contributing to the kingdom's workforce. This figure includes 70,000 burden-bearers, 80,000 stonecutters, and 3,600 overseers, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a>. The large number reflects the scale of Solomon's building projects and the economic and social structures of the time.

Numbering people is not mere bookkeeping; it is purposeful stewardship. Just as a shepherd &#8220;knows the number of his sheep&#8221; (see <a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>), Solomon assesses available labor for the massive temple project (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-2.htm">2 Chronicles 2:2</a>). By counting, the king acknowledges that every worker, even a foreigner, is under God&#8217;s sovereign oversight (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The census shows order, planning, and accountability.<p>&#8226; It also underscores that building God&#8217;s house must be done intentionally, never haphazardly (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the foreign men</b><p>These are non-Israelite residents&#8212;descendants of the Canaanite peoples left in the land (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-22</a>). Scripture repeatedly distinguishes between native Israelites and sojourners, yet it also calls for fair treatment of the latter (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48-49</a>). Here, foreigners are conscripted as laborers rather than warriors, reflecting both their outsider status and their value to the kingdom&#8217;s work (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant people lead, but God still employs outsiders in His purposes (cf. Rahab in <a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>; the Gibeonites in <a href="/bsb/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>).<p>&#8226; The inclusion of foreigners foreshadows the day when &#8220;all nations will stream&#8221; to worship the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Israel</b><p>The census concerns those physically residing &#8220;in the land,&#8221; underscoring that God&#8217;s promises and commands are tied to a concrete place (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>). Work for the temple must be sourced locally, reminding us that service to God is lived out where we actually are (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The land is God&#8217;s gift (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>); its occupants, native or not, fall under His authority.<p>&#8226; The presence of foreigners highlights Israel&#8217;s call to model righteousness before the nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>following the census his father David had conducted</b><p>Solomon honors and extends David&#8217;s earlier preparations (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>). Whereas David once sinned by numbering fighting men without God&#8217;s sanction (<a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1-10</a>), his later census of resident aliens was expressly for temple work&#8212;an obedient act Solomon now builds upon. The verse underscores generational continuity: fathers lay groundwork; sons complete the task (<a href="/1_kings/5-3.htm">1 Kings 5:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God redeems even flawed leaders by weaving their obedience, not their failures, into His plan.<p>&#8226; Faithful succession matters; each generation must pick up the tools left by the previous one (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there were found to be 153,600 in all</b><p>Scripture records the final tally to highlight God&#8217;s provision. The very specificity&#8212;153,600&#8212;assures us the chronicler is citing historical fact, not legend. In the next verse Solomon organizes them: 70,000 burden-bearers, 80,000 stonecutters, 3,600 overseers (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a>). The size of the workforce testifies both to the grandeur of the temple and to the meticulous management required (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God equips His people with adequate resources&#8212;human and material&#8212;to accomplish His will (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also reminds us that everyone has a role; varying assignments serve one united purpose (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a> shows Solomon methodically enrolling 153,600 resident foreigners to build the temple. The verse highlights responsible leadership, the rightful inclusion of non-Israelites in God&#8217;s work, respect for the land&#8217;s covenant significance, continuity with David&#8217;s preparations, and the precise sufficiency of God&#8217;s provision.
