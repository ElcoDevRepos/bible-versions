Samuel, the last judge of Israel, lived during a time when the nation was transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy. The reference to Samuel indicates that the Passover had not been celebrated with such devotion and adherence to the Law since the early days of the united monarchy. This suggests a period of spiritual decline and neglect of religious practices. Josiah's reforms, therefore, represent a return to the covenantal faithfulness that characterized the time of Samuel. The emphasis on the Passover also points to its importance as a commemoration of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, a foundational event in their history.<p><b>None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover like the one that Josiah observed</b><br>This statement underscores the unparalleled nature of Josiah's Passover. Despite the many kings who ruled over Israel and Judah, none had celebrated the Passover with such zeal and adherence to the Mosaic Law. Josiah's dedication to restoring proper worship is a testament to his commitment to God and the covenant. This also reflects the spiritual renewal that Josiah sought to bring about in the nation, aligning with the Deuteronomic reforms that emphasized the centralization of worship in Jerusalem and adherence to the Law.<p><b>with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, the Israelites who were present, and the people of Jerusalem.</b><br>This phrase indicates the inclusivity and communal nature of the Passover celebration. The involvement of the priests and Levites highlights the restoration of proper religious order and the importance of their roles in leading worship. The mention of "all Judah" and "the Israelites who were present" suggests that this was a unifying event, bringing together the remnants of the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). The gathering in Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center, signifies the centralization of worship and the fulfillment of the command to celebrate the Passover at the place God chose. This unity and centralization are reminiscent of the ideal worship community envisioned in the Law and foreshadow the ultimate gathering of God's people in the eschatological kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated a significant religious reform and restoration of the Passover celebration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_samuel.htm">Prophet Samuel</a></b><br>A key figure in Israel's history, marking a time of spiritual leadership and transition from judges to kings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for conducting the Passover and maintaining temple worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms, with Judah being the southern kingdom where Josiah reigned, and Israel referring to the northern tribes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/revival_through_obedience.htm">Revival through Obedience</a></b><br>Josiah's observance of the Passover demonstrates the power of returning to God's commands to bring about spiritual revival.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_in_worship.htm">Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's role as a leader underscores the importance of godly leadership in guiding others toward true worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The gathering of all Judah and Israel signifies the unifying power of worship and obedience to God&#8217;s commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_reflection.htm">Historical Reflection</a></b><br>Reflecting on past spiritual milestones, like the days of Samuel, can inspire current and future faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/comprehensive_participation.htm">Comprehensive Participation</a></b><br>The involvement of priests, Levites, and all the people highlights the communal aspect of worship and the need for everyone&#8217;s participation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_35_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 35:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_35_18_s_relevance_to_God_s_commands.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 35:18 emphasize the importance of observing God's commands today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Josiah_s_Passover_for_worship_3.htm">What lessons from Josiah's Passover can we apply to our worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_Passover_vs_Exodus_12_Passover.htm">How does Josiah's Passover connect with the Passover in Exodus 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_celebrate_God_s_past_deliverances.htm">Why is it important to remember and celebrate God's past deliverances in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ensure_worship_sincerity_like_Josiah.htm">How can we ensure our worship is as sincere as Josiah's Passover celebration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_35_18_s_Passover_significance.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 35:18 highlight the significance of Passover in Israel's history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Josiah_s_Passover_unique.htm">Why was Josiah's Passover celebration unparalleled since the days of Samuel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_leadership_in_2_Chron_35_18.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 35:18 reveal about Josiah's leadership and religious reforms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_35.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_2_chr_35_18_ignore_hezekiah's_passover.htm">In 2 Chronicles 35:18, why does the text claim no Passover like Josiah&#8217;s had been celebrated &#8220;since the days of Samuel,&#8221; seemingly ignoring the grand Passover of Hezekiah in 2 Chronicles 30?
