The context is King Asa's victory over the Cushites, a significant event in Judah's history. The "tents of the herdsmen" suggests a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle, common in the ancient Near East. Herdsmen were often vulnerable to raids, as their wealth was in livestock. This action reflects the spoils of war, a common practice in ancient times, where victors would seize goods and livestock from the defeated.<p><b>and carried off many sheep and camels.</b><br>Sheep and camels were valuable assets in the ancient world, representing wealth and sustenance. Sheep provided wool, meat, and milk, while camels were essential for transportation and trade, especially in desert regions. The mention of camels indicates the geographical context, likely involving trade routes or desert fringes. This act of carrying off livestock signifies a complete victory and the transfer of wealth and resources from the defeated to the victors.<p><b>Then they returned to Jerusalem.</b><br>The return to Jerusalem signifies the conclusion of the military campaign and the restoration of peace and order. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Judah, was the logical place for the army to regroup and celebrate their victory. This return also symbolizes the protection and blessing of God over Judah, as Jerusalem was the site of the Temple, representing God's presence among His people.

The expression awakens inevitably, though inaptly, a reminiscence of Scripture language in strangest contrast - the climax in a description also, but of a victory infinitely vaster and grander and for ever (<a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>; <a href="/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>). This return of "Asa and the people that were with him" to Jerusalem dated the commencement of a period of comparative internal peace and reform for the kingdom of Judah, that lasted twenty-one years, and yet more of exemption from Egyptian attack, that lasted about three hundred and thirty years (B.C. circ. 940-609). It was a doubtful benefit, but Judah and Egypt came to be found in alliance against Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20, 21, 24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>). The 'Speaker's Commentary' points out the interesting fact that this was one of the only two occasions known of the Jews meeting in open field either Egypt or Assyria (the other occasion being the unfortunate one of Josiah against Necho, 2 Chronicles 35:30), and adds, "Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, and Ptolemy I., were either unopposed or only opposed from behind wails." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/14-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
