The Levites were divided into families and divisions, each with specific roles and responsibilities in temple service. This organization can be traced back to the time of Moses, where the Levites were set apart for service to God (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>). The division by families ensured that each group knew their duties, promoting efficiency and reverence in worship. This structure is a precursor to the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member has a unique role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>according to the instructions written by David king of Israel</b><br>David's instructions for temple service are detailed in <a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-26</a>, where he organized the Levites into divisions for various duties. David, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), received divine guidance in establishing these orders, which were intended to ensure that worship was conducted in a manner pleasing to God. This reflects the importance of adhering to God-given instructions in worship, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture. David's role as a king who prepared for the temple, though he did not build it, foreshadows Christ, who prepares a place for believers (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<p><b>and Solomon his son</b><br>Solomon, who built the temple, followed his father David's instructions, demonstrating the continuity of God's plan through generations. Solomon's reign is marked by wisdom and the establishment of the temple as a central place of worship (1 Kings 6-8). This continuity underscores the importance of passing down faith and obedience to God's commands from one generation to the next. Solomon's temple, a place where God's presence dwelt, is a type of Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), and in whom the fullness of God dwells (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david,_king_of_israel.htm">David, King of Israel</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for uniting the tribes and establishing Jerusalem as the capital.
