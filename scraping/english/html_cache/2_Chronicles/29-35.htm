In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29</a>, King Hezekiah is leading a revival in Judah, restoring proper worship practices after a period of neglect under his father, King Ahaz. Burnt offerings were a key component of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and complete surrender to God (Leviticus 1). The abundance indicates the people's eagerness to return to God and seek His favor.<p><b>along with the fat of the peace offerings</b><br>Peace offerings, also known as fellowship offerings, were meant to symbolize reconciliation and communion with God (Leviticus 3). The fat, considered the best part, was offered to God, while the rest was shared in a communal meal. This practice highlights the restored relationship between God and His people, emphasizing fellowship and thanksgiving. The inclusion of peace offerings alongside burnt offerings underscores a holistic approach to worship, involving both atonement and celebration.<p><b>and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings</b><br>Drink offerings, typically wine, were poured out as a libation accompanying other sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). They symbolize the outpouring of one's life in service to God, complementing the burnt offerings' theme of total dedication. The integration of drink offerings with burnt offerings reflects a comprehensive worship practice, involving various elements to express devotion and gratitude.<p><b>So the service of the house of the LORD was established</b><br>This phrase indicates the successful reestablishment of temple worship, which had been neglected. King Hezekiah's reforms included cleansing the temple, restoring the priesthood, and reinstituting proper sacrificial practices (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3-36</a>). The "service of the house of the LORD" refers to the regular, organized worship and sacrifices conducted by the priests and Levites. This restoration is a pivotal moment in Judah's history, symbolizing a return to covenant faithfulness and foreshadowing the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends the Old Testament sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship.

Scripture records the sequence so we can trace the unfolding obedience (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20&#8211;24</a>). This connective reminds us:<p>&#8226; God is interested in every step of renewal, not only the dramatic highlights.<p>&#8226; Genuine reform continues &#8220;further&#8221; until the Lord&#8217;s full pattern is honored (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-20.htm">2 Chronicles 31:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the burnt offerings were abundant</b><p>Burnt offerings were wholly consumed on the altar, symbolizing total dedication to God (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).
