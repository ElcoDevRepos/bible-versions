Solomon, the son of David, was tasked with building the Temple, a project that took seven years to complete (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>). The Temple was to be the permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and the center of worship for the Israelites. This completion signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The Temple's completion also represents a shift from the mobile Tabernacle used during the wilderness wanderings to a permanent structure, symbolizing stability and God's enduring presence among His people.<p><b>Then Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated&#8212;</b><br>David, although not permitted by God to build the Temple himself due to his history as a warrior (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), had prepared extensively for its construction. He gathered materials and dedicated items for the Temple, showing his devotion and foresight (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14-16</a>). These items included precious metals and other resources necessary for the Temple's adornment and function. This act of bringing in the dedicated items signifies the continuity of David's vision and Solomon's role in bringing it to fruition, highlighting the importance of generational faithfulness and preparation in fulfilling God's plans.<p><b>the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings&#8212;</b><br>The mention of silver and gold underscores the wealth and splendor of the Temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. These materials were used extensively in the construction and decoration of the Temple, as described in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6 and 7</a>. The furnishings included the altar, the table for the showbread, the lampstands, and other items necessary for worship and sacrifices. The use of such precious materials also points to the value and importance of worship in the life of Israel, as well as the reverence due to God. This opulence can be seen as a type of the heavenly reality, where God's presence is surrounded by glory and majesty (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>).<p><b>and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.</b><br>The treasuries of the Temple served as storage for the wealth and offerings dedicated to God. These treasuries were essential for the maintenance of the Temple and the support of the priests and Levites who served there. The act of placing these items in the treasuries signifies the dedication of resources for God's purposes and the proper stewardship of what has been given to Him. This also reflects the principle of giving God the first and best of what we have, as seen in the practice of tithing and offerings throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>). The treasuries can also be seen as a type of the spiritual treasures believers are to store up in heaven, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, Solomon is the king of Israel who is known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The former king of Israel, David had a deep desire to build a temple for the Lord, but God chose his son Solomon to complete this task.

The temple-building, which had been commenced in Solomon's fourth year, had occupied seven years in construction (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>), but another thirteen years in furnishing (<a href="/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 2</a>). The record of Chronicles is, of course, in some respects somewhat more sketchy than that of Kings; and the correct view of the chronology has in both writers to be sought and read between the lines. It was when the house and "all the work designed for the house of the Lord was finished," that (ver. 2) "Solomon assembled the elders," etc., and arranged for the solemn dedication; that is, when four years of his reign, and seven years of building and thirteen years of furnishing, etc., had elapsed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the work</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1499;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
