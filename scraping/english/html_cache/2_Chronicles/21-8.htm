His reign is noted for its departure from the godly ways of his father, as he led Judah into idolatry and wickedness. This period marks a significant decline in the spiritual and political stability of Judah. Jehoram's marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, further influenced his reign negatively, aligning Judah more closely with the idolatrous practices of the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah</b><br>Edom, a nation descended from Esau, had been under the control of Judah since the time of King David. The rebellion signifies a weakening of Judah's power and influence, as Edom seized the opportunity to assert its independence. This rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Esau in <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, where it was foretold that Esau's descendants would eventually break free from Jacob's yoke. The rebellion also reflects the broader geopolitical instability during Jehoram's reign.<p><b>and appointed their own king</b><br>By appointing their own king, Edom was establishing itself as an independent nation, no longer subject to Judah's authority. This act of appointing a king was a declaration of sovereignty and a rejection of Judah's rule. It highlights the political fragmentation occurring during Jehoram's reign and serves as a precursor to further challenges Judah would face from surrounding nations. The appointment of a king in Edom also underscores the importance of leadership and governance in maintaining national identity and autonomy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this period, Jehoram was the son of Jehoshaphat.
