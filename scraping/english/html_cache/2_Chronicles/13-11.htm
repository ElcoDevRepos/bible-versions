The morning and evening sacrifices were a continual reminder of the people's dependence on God and their commitment to Him. The burnt offerings symbolize atonement and complete surrender to God, while the fragrant incense represents prayers ascending to Him (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). This practice underscores the importance of consistent devotion and the centrality of worship in the life of Israel.<p><b>They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table,</b><br>The showbread, also known as the "bread of the Presence," was placed on a table in the Holy Place of the tabernacle and later the temple (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). It consisted of twelve loaves, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying God's provision and the covenant relationship between God and His people. The table had to be ceremonially clean, emphasizing the holiness required in approaching God. This practice points to Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), fulfilling the spiritual sustenance symbolized by the showbread.<p><b>and every evening they light the lamps of the gold lampstand.</b><br>The lighting of the lamps on the gold lampstand, or menorah, was a daily ritual (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20-21</a>). The menorah, with its seven branches, symbolized the light of God's presence and guidance. It was to burn continually, representing the perpetual nature of God's covenant and His illumination in the lives of His people. This imagery is fulfilled in Jesus, who declared Himself the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), bringing spiritual enlightenment and truth.<p><b>We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God,</b><br>This statement asserts the faithfulness of the priests and the people of Judah in adhering to the commands given by God. It reflects a commitment to uphold the covenant and maintain the prescribed worship practices. This obedience is contrasted with the actions of the northern kingdom, which had turned away from God's commands. The emphasis on following God's requirements highlights the importance of faithfulness and obedience in maintaining a relationship with Him.<p><b>while you have forsaken Him.</b><br>This phrase addresses the apostasy of the northern kingdom of Israel, which had abandoned the worship of the LORD in favor of idolatry and false practices (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). The division between Judah and Israel is marked by differing levels of faithfulness to God's covenant. This forsaking of God led to spiritual and eventually physical decline, serving as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God. It underscores the biblical theme of the necessity of remaining true to God and His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is speaking in this passage, addressing the people of Israel and contrasting their practices with those of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who led the northern tribes away from the worship of the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for Judah, where the prescribed rituals and sacrifices were maintained.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for maintaining the temple services and rituals as commanded by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings_and_incense.htm">Burnt Offerings and Incense</a></b><br>Daily rituals performed in the temple as acts of worship and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_worship.htm">Faithfulness in Worship</a></b><br>Abijah emphasizes the importance of maintaining the prescribed worship practices.
