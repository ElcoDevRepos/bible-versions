This title is often used for prophets or individuals who speak on behalf of God, such as Moses, Elijah, and Elisha. It indicates a person with divine authority and insight. In the context of 2 Chronicles, prophets played a crucial role in guiding the kings of Judah, often calling them back to faithfulness to God.<p><b>&#8220;What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the troops of Israel?&#8221;</b><br>Amaziah had hired mercenaries from the northern kingdom of Israel, which was often at odds with Judah. The "hundred talents" refers to a significant sum of money, indicating Amaziah's investment in military strength. This reflects the political and military tensions between Israel and Judah during this period. The hiring of these troops suggests a lack of trust in God's provision and protection, as Amaziah sought to bolster his forces through human means.<p><b>And the man of God replied,</b><br>The prophet's response is authoritative, reflecting the divine wisdom and guidance that comes from God. Prophets often delivered messages that challenged the status quo or human reasoning, calling people to trust in God's power and provision.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD is able to give you much more than this.&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's sovereignty and ability to provide abundantly beyond human efforts or resources. It echoes biblical themes of faith and reliance on God rather than on human strength or wealth. Similar sentiments are found in passages like <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, which speaks of God's ability to do "immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine."

When a prophet&#8212;called simply &#8220;the man of God&#8221; (v. 7)&#8212;warned him that the LORD was not with Israel&#8217;s idolatrous soldiers, Amaziah paused to seek clarification.<p>&#8226; Amaziah&#8217;s willingness to consult the prophet shows a spark of humility, even though his overall reign was &#8220;not wholeheartedly&#8221; devoted to God (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-2.htm">2 Chronicles 25:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently honors those who inquire of God before acting (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing a recognized spokesman of the LORD, Amaziah acknowledged that divine counsel outranks political or military strategy (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the troops of Israel?&#8221;</b><p>The king&#8217;s first concern is economic: he already paid about 7,500 pounds of silver&#8212;an enormous sum&#8212;to Israel&#8217;s soldiers.<p>&#8226; Material loss often feels more pressing than moral compromise; Amaziah voices the same fear that keeps many from obedience today (<a href="/matthew/19-22.htm">Matthew 19:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes a heart dilemma: trust God or cling to sunk costs?
