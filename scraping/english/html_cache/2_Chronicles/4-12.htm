They stood at the entrance of the temple, symbolizing strength and stability. In biblical symbolism, pillars often represent support and establishment. These pillars were made of bronze, a metal associated with judgment and endurance. Their presence at the temple's entrance may signify the strength and permanence of God's covenant with Israel. The pillars are also mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>, emphasizing their importance in the temple's design.<p><b>the two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars</b><br>The capitals were ornate, bowl-shaped structures that adorned the tops of the pillars. These capitals were intricately designed, featuring motifs such as lilies and pomegranates, which are symbols of beauty and abundance. The use of such designs reflects the artistry and craftsmanship of the period, as well as the temple's role as a place of divine beauty and worship. The capitals' design may also symbolize the heavenly realm, as they crown the pillars that support the temple, much like the heavens crown the earth.<p><b>the two sets of network covering both bowls of the capitals atop the pillars</b><br>The network refers to the latticework or mesh that covered the capitals, adding to their decorative complexity. This network likely served both an aesthetic and functional purpose, enhancing the visual appeal of the temple while also providing structural support. The intricate design of the network can be seen as a reflection of the interconnectedness of God's creation and the detailed care with which He oversees His covenant people. The network's presence on the capitals may also symbolize the interwoven nature of God's laws and the lives of His people, as seen in the detailed laws given to Israel in the Torah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple in Jerusalem.

Paul calls the church &#8220;the pillar and foundation of the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>), and Peter says believers are &#8220;living stones&#8221; built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Taken literally, Solomon&#8217;s physical pillars marked the entrance; taken symbolically, they preached stability, permanence, and strength found only in the Lord (<a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The two bowl-shaped capitals atop the pillars</b><p>&#8220;the two bowls and the capitals atop the pillars&#8221;<p>&#8226; Each pillar was crowned with a five-cubit-high capital shaped like a lily-blossom bowl (<a href="/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>).

The word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, occurring fifteen times, and translated seven times "net-work," five times "wreath," or "wreathen-work," once a "snare," once "checker-work," and once a "lattice." These <span class="accented">wreaths</span> were of some lace pattern plaiting and festoons of fancy chain-work. The fuller expression of them is found in <a href="/1_kings/7-17.htm">1 Kings 7:17</a>, though in description not more distinct, certainly - "nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;na&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - md<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pillars;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5982.htm">Strong's 5982: </a> </span><span class="str2">A column, a stand, platform</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bowl-shaped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hag&#183;gul&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
