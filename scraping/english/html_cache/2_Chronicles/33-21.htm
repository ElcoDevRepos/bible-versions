The age of twenty-two suggests a period of transition and potential vulnerability for the kingdom, as young rulers often faced challenges in establishing authority. This age also indicates that Amon was born during the earlier years of Manasseh's reign, a time marked by idolatry and apostasy, which likely influenced Amon's own spiritual and political inclinations. The youth of Amon at his ascension is reminiscent of other young kings in Judah's history, such as Josiah, who became king at eight years old, highlighting the recurring theme of youthful leadership in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, served as the political and spiritual center of the kingdom. Amon's reign in this city underscores the continuity of the Davidic line, as Jerusalem was the city chosen by God for His temple and the seat of David's dynasty. The mention of Jerusalem also emphasizes the city's significance in biblical prophecy and its role as a type of the heavenly Jerusalem, a theme explored in the New Testament. Amon's rule in Jerusalem connects him to the legacy of his forefathers, including David and Solomon, who established the city as a central place of worship and governance.<p><b>two years</b><br>Amon's brief reign of two years is indicative of instability and potential divine judgment. His short tenure contrasts sharply with the long reign of his father, Manasseh, and suggests a period of turmoil and dissatisfaction among the people or the ruling elite. The brevity of his reign may also reflect the consequences of his actions, as Amon continued in the idolatrous practices of his father, which ultimately led to his assassination by his own officials. This short reign serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of departing from God's commandments and the fleeting nature of earthly power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>Amon was the son of Manasseh and became king of Judah at the age of twenty-two.

The son who succeeded him was twenty-two years old, born therefore not before his father was forty-five years old. This may be an indication that it was indeed not one son only whom Manasseh "caused to pass through the fire" (ver. 6). He emulated the sins of the former life of his father, but did not, like him, repent. It will be noted that in ver. 19 of the parallel his mother's name is given as "Meshulle-meth, the daughter of Haruz, of Jotbah," of whom nothing is known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/33-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Amon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_526.htm">Strong's 526: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amon -- 'masterworkman', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was twenty-two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he became king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
