His youth may have contributed to his susceptibility to external influences and idolatry. The age of twenty is significant in biblical terms, often marking the beginning of adulthood and responsibility (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years</b><br>Ahaz's reign in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, lasted for sixteen years. This period was marked by significant political turmoil and spiritual decline. Jerusalem, as the city of David, held great importance as the site of the temple, the center of worship for the Israelites. Ahaz's reign saw the introduction of foreign religious practices, which had lasting impacts on the kingdom.<p><b>And unlike David his father</b><br>The reference to David highlights the standard of righteousness and faithfulness to God that Ahaz failed to meet. David, though not without sin, was known for his heart after God (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The term "father" here is used in a broader ancestral sense, as David was Ahaz's forefather. This comparison underscores the deviation from the covenantal faithfulness expected of the Davidic line.<p><b>he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD</b><br>Ahaz's actions were contrary to the covenantal laws and expectations set by God for the kings of Israel and Judah. His reign was characterized by idolatry and alliances with pagan nations, which were condemned by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/7-10.htm">Isaiah 7:10-13</a>). This phrase indicates a moral and spiritual failure, contrasting with the ideal of kingship exemplified by David. The "eyes of the LORD" phrase emphasizes God's omniscience and the divine standard by which all actions are judged.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at the age of twenty.
