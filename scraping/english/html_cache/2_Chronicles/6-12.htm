The altar of the LORD was located in the newly constructed Temple in Jerusalem, which Solomon had built as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant. This act of standing before the altar signifies a position of intercession and leadership, reminiscent of Moses and Aaron, who also stood before the LORD on behalf of the people. The altar represents a place of sacrifice and communion with God, highlighting the importance of worship and atonement in the life of Israel.<p><b>in front of the whole assembly of Israel</b><br>The gathering of the whole assembly of Israel underscores the communal nature of this event. It was a national occasion, with representatives from all the tribes present, signifying unity and collective worship. This assembly reflects the covenant community of Israel, bound together by their shared history and faith in Yahweh. The public nature of Solomon's actions emphasizes transparency and accountability in leadership, as well as the importance of corporate worship. This moment is a fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding his descendants and the establishment of a kingdom.<p><b>and spread out his hands.</b><br>Spreading out his hands is a gesture of prayer and supplication, symbolizing openness and a plea for divine intervention. This posture is seen throughout Scripture as a physical expression of seeking God's favor and blessing (e.g., <a href="/exodus/9-29.htm">Exodus 9:29</a>, <a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). It indicates humility and dependence on God, acknowledging His sovereignty and the need for His guidance. This act by Solomon can also be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of His people, bridging the gap between humanity and God. Solomon's prayer that follows is a profound example of intercessory prayer, seeking God's presence and faithfulness to His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.
