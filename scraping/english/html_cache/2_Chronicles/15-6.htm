The division of Israel into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah) led to frequent conflicts. This turmoil can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>, where disobedience to God would result in national calamity. The phrase also echoes the broader biblical theme of divine judgment upon nations that turn away from God, as seen in the prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>and city by city</b><br>The mention of cities being crushed highlights the widespread nature of the conflict and chaos. In ancient times, cities were centers of power, commerce, and culture. The destruction of cities signifies not just military defeat but also economic and social collapse. This devastation can be compared to the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>, where the city was besieged and destroyed by the Babylonians. The phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment that comes upon a people who forsake their covenant with God.<p><b>for God afflicted them</b><br>This part of the verse attributes the adversity directly to God's intervention. It reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over the affairs of nations and uses circumstances to bring about His purposes. This is consistent with the theology of the Old Testament, where God is seen as actively involved in the world, disciplining His people to bring them back to Himself. The affliction is not merely punitive but is intended to lead to repentance and restoration, as seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and deliverance throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>with all kinds of adversity</b><br>The phrase indicates the variety and intensity of the challenges faced by the people. This could include military defeat, economic hardship, social unrest, and natural disasters. Such adversities are often used in the Bible to draw people back to reliance on God, as seen in the prophetic calls to repentance in books like Joel and Amos. The comprehensive nature of the adversity serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments and the need for national and personal repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of this prophecy.

This is literal history, previewed long before in God&#8217;s covenant warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). Because Israel and her neighbors rejected the Lord, He withdrew His protective hand, allowing outside forces to gain the upper hand (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Each hostile border raid or invasion shouted that peace cannot last when a nation forsakes God (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern reminds us that international chaos is often a mirror of spiritual chaos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and city by city</b><p>The unrest wasn&#8217;t limited to borders; it seeped into the streets. &#8220;City by city&#8221; points to local breakdowns&#8212;towns fighting neighboring towns, clans turning on one another (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23-25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Internal fractures are God&#8217;s megaphone, warning that sin erodes the bonds that hold communities together (<a href="/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>).<p>&#8226; King Asa&#8217;s generation could look back to the turbulent days of the judges and see the same lesson: when God is sidelined, unity disintegrates (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for God afflicted them</b><p>Scripture is clear: &#8220;for God afflicted them.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t a passive observer; He was the righteous Judge administering discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>; <a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; His affliction was corrective, not spiteful&#8212;meant to drive the people to seek Him (2 Chron 15:4).<p>&#8226; Ignoring God doesn&#8217;t merely remove blessing; it invites His active opposition (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-40.htm">Psalm 106:40-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all kinds of adversity</b><p>The phrase &#8220;all kinds of adversity&#8221; gathers every form of hardship&#8212;war, famine, plague, economic collapse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20-22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-37.htm">1 Kings 8:37</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s toolkit of discipline is varied, because different hearts respond to different pressures.<p>&#8226; Yet every adversity carried the same call: &#8220;Return to Me, and I will return to you&#8221; (2 Chron 7:13-14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/15-6.htm">2 Chronicles 15:6</a> is a sober snapshot of what happens when nations and cities abandon the Lord.
