The rebellion mentioned here marks a significant shift in the balance of power. This rebellion began during the reign of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, and continued as a persistent issue for Judah. The phrase "to this day" indicates the ongoing nature of Edom's independence at the time of the chronicler's writing. This rebellion fulfilled the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where it was foretold that the older (Edom) would serve the younger (Israel), but the struggle between the two nations would be ongoing. The Edomites' rebellion is a consequence of Jehoram's unfaithfulness, reflecting the broader biblical theme that disobedience to God leads to political and social instability.<p><b>Likewise, Libnah rebelled against his hand at the same time,</b><br>Libnah was a city in the Shephelah region of Judah. Its rebellion against Jehoram's rule signifies internal strife within the kingdom. The city's revolt is indicative of the dissatisfaction with Jehoram's leadership, which was marked by idolatry and departure from the ways of his father, Jehoshaphat. Libnah's rebellion is not just a political act but also a spiritual statement against Jehoram's apostasy. This event is a reminder of the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where faithfulness leads to blessing and unfaithfulness to turmoil. The simultaneous rebellion of both Edom and Libnah underscores the widespread discontent and the weakening of Judah's political power during Jehoram's reign.<p><b>because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.</b><br>Jehoram's forsaking of the LORD is the root cause of the rebellions. He abandoned the faith of his ancestors, which included notable kings like David and Jehoshaphat, who were devoted to God. Jehoram's actions included the introduction of pagan practices and the construction of high places, leading Judah into idolatry. This departure from the covenant with God resulted in divine judgment, manifesting in the form of political instability and rebellion. The phrase highlights the biblical principle that leadership's spiritual fidelity directly impacts the nation's well-being. Jehoram's forsaking of God contrasts sharply with the faithfulness of his forefathers, serving as a cautionary tale of the consequences of turning away from God. This narrative echoes the Deuteronomic theme that blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, historically under the control of Judah but now in rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by the line of David, experiencing internal and external strife during King Jehoram's reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/libnah.htm">Libnah</a></b><br>A city in the Shephelah of Judah, which also rebelled against King Jehoram's rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation into idolatry and away from the worship of the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forsaking_the_lord.htm">Forsaking the LORD</a></b><br>The central reason for the rebellion, highlighting the spiritual decline under Jehoram's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_forsaking_god.htm">Consequences of Forsaking God</a></b><br>Jehoram's abandonment of the LORD led to political instability and rebellion.

The chronicler adds, "from under his (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Jehoram's) hand," and assigns a moral ground for the successful rebellion: "For he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers." (Thenius can hardly be right in asserting that the chronicler meant to say that Libnah, <span class= "ital">as a city of the priests,</span> refused obedience to the idolatrous king; nor Hitzig, in explaining the revolt as merely a <span class= "ital">religious</span> secession. ) He forsook Jehovah, by "walking in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by adopting and popularising the worship of the Tyrian Baal, to please his wife and her people.
