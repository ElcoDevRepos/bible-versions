The "whole assembly" suggests a united Israel, emphasizing national unity under Solomon's reign. Gibeon, a significant city in the tribal territory of Benjamin, was known for its high place, a common site for worship before the temple was built in Jerusalem. This location was historically significant as it was where the Gibeonites had deceived Joshua into making a treaty (Joshua 9). The high place at Gibeon was one of the most important worship sites during this period, as the temple had not yet been constructed.<p><b>because it was the location of God&#8217;s Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. It was a central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence with His people. The Tent of Meeting being at Gibeon highlights the continuity of worship practices from the time of Moses to Solomon. This location served as a temporary center of worship until the construction of the temple in Jerusalem, which Solomon would later build.<p><b>which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness</b><br>Moses, referred to as the "servant of the LORD," underscores his role as a faithful leader and mediator between God and Israel. The construction of the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness was a direct command from God (Exodus 25-31), and it was meticulously crafted according to divine specifications. This phrase connects Solomon's actions to the foundational period of Israel's history, linking the past covenantal relationship with God to the present. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the Tabernacle, as He "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), providing a permanent means of access to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

It may readily be allowed that even nature and instinct would suggest a certain fitness in selecting <span class="accented">high</span> places, and the impressive grandeur of groves, for the worship of the High and Lofty One and for the offerings of sacrifice to him. It was not otherwise historically (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3, 4</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>). However<span class="accented">, first</span>, it was part of the education of a nation (situated in the heart of the young world) in the unity of the one God, that its worship should be offered in one place, and the smoke of its sacrifices ascend from <span class="accented">one</span> altar; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, it was not difficult to foresee that the very force that lay in the associations, which dictated the choice of some places (not least, certainly, "the grove"), would constitute their weakness and snare. The prohibitions, therefore, of the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26</a>), witnessed to by such corroborations as are found in commands to obliterate certain Canaanitish traces, that looked long time a different way (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>), approve themselves as in thorough harmony with what all would feel to be the genius of the religious education of Israel, and, through Israel, of the nations of the world. The wonder that impresses us is rather that means were not found to abide by the "letter" of the Law to a far greater degree during all the generations that elapsed before the people were settled in their land, and were gathered in their temple so typical. Is it not possible to regard this as an impressive instance of how, even in a system that sought to be of the closest and most exclusive, the "<span class="accented">spirit</span>," by force of circumstances, resented the tyrannous bondage of the "letter"? Anyway, for ages from the time of that prohibition, the nation had the moral principle as their guide rather than any possibility of keeping safe within a commandment's "letter" (so see <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26</a>; <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-24</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>). Even now, accordingly, the prohibited is still the observed, and by Solomon, too, in the steps of David, even if it be necessary to describe it as the "winked at." And to the "high place" at Gibeon Solomon and all the representatives, <span class="accented">the congregation</span> of Israel, have to repair in order to do sacrifice. The tabernacle was now at Gibeon, whither it had come from Nob (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1, 6</a>; from which latter reference, speaking of the "shew-bread," it comes that we know the tabernacle to have resided at Nob awhile; for the circumstance is not positively narrated in any passage of the history (but see also <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9, 11</a>). <span class="accented">Gibeon</span> was one of the four Hivite cities, the other three being Beeroth, Chephirah, and Kirjath-jearim. It had its first fame from its "wiliness" (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 4</a>, etc.). By the directest road, it was five miles distant from Jerusalem, in the direction of the sea. It was further noted for the encounter between Joab and Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). Again, for the slaying of Amasa by Joab (<a href="/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6-10</a>), and for the death of Joab himself at the hand of Benalak, at the very horns of the altar (<a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-34</a>). Although the exact date of the lodging of the tabernacle at Gibeon is not told us, nor even the person who was answerable for briging it there, yet there can be no reasonable doubt that it was David, as we read (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>) of his appointing the priests to offer "the daily sacrifices" there, on the brazen altar of Moses, when Zadok was at their head, and Heman and Jeduthun were their resident musicians. In what particular part of Gibeon or of its immediate neighbourhood the tabernacle was stationed cannot be said with any certainty. Amid a considerable choice of likely places, one forming part of Gibeon itself, and just south of <span class="accented">El-Tib</span>, seems the likeliest, and to be preferred to the suggestion of Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 216), of <span class="accented">Neby-Samuil</span>, which is a mile distant. The present imposing occasion is the last of any importance on which Gibeon is brought before us (see also <a href="/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There was the tabernacle</span>. The removal of the tabernacle to Gibeon no doubt followed immediately on the destruction of Nob by Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>, compared with 37;
