The establishment of the kingdom by the LORD signifies God's approval and blessing upon Jehoshaphat's reign. This echoes the biblical theme that true authority and stability come from God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). The phrase also reflects the covenantal relationship between God and the Davidic line, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God promises to establish David's throne forever. Jehoshaphat's reliance on God is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfills the role of a king established by God.<p><b>and all Judah brought him tribute</b><br>The act of bringing tribute indicates the loyalty and support of the people of Judah towards Jehoshaphat. This was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where subjects would bring gifts to their king as a sign of allegiance and respect. The unity and cooperation of Judah under Jehoshaphat's rule can be seen as a fulfillment of the blessings promised to those who follow God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). This also prefigures the homage that all nations will bring to Christ, the King of Kings, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-6</a>.<p><b>so that he had an abundance of riches and honor</b><br>The abundance of riches and honor bestowed upon Jehoshaphat is a testament to God's favor and the prosperity that comes from righteous leadership. This prosperity is reminiscent of Solomon's reign, where wisdom and adherence to God's laws led to great wealth and honor (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-25</a>). The phrase underscores the biblical principle that those who seek God's kingdom and righteousness will be blessed materially and spiritually (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). Jehoshaphat's wealth and honor can be seen as a foreshadowing of the eternal riches and glory found in Christ, who provides spiritual abundance to His followers (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, over which Jehoshaphat reigned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who established Jehoshaphat's kingdom and blessed him with prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribute.htm">Tribute</a></b><br>The offerings or gifts brought by the people of Judah to Jehoshaphat, signifying their loyalty and the prosperity of his reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/riches_and_honor.htm">Riches and Honor</a></b><br>The material wealth and respect that Jehoshaphat received as a result of his faithfulness to God and God's favor upon him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_establishment.htm">God's Establishment</a></b><br>Recognize that true stability and success come from the Lord's establishment.
