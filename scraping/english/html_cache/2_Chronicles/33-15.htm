The presence of foreign gods and idols in the temple was a direct violation of the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Manasseh's earlier reign was marked by idolatry and apostasy, as he introduced pagan worship practices into Judah (<a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21:1-9</a>). His removal of these idols signifies a return to monotheistic worship and a rejection of syncretism. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic calls to repentance found throughout the Old Testament, such as in the messages of Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>along with all the altars he had built on the temple mount and in Jerusalem</b><br>The temple mount, also known as Mount Moriah, holds significant historical and religious importance as the site of Solomon's Temple. Manasseh's construction of altars for pagan worship on this sacred site was a grave offense, as it desecrated the place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh. The removal of these altars represents a cleansing and restoration of the temple's sanctity. This action echoes the reforms of other righteous kings, such as Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3-5</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>), who also sought to purify worship in Judah.<p><b>and he dumped them outside the city</b><br>The act of dumping the idols and altars outside the city symbolizes a complete rejection and renunciation of idolatry. By removing these objects from Jerusalem, Manasseh was not only purifying the city but also making a public statement of his commitment to the covenant with God. This action parallels the biblical principle of removing sin from the community, as seen in the practice of the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ, who was crucified outside the city (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), bearing the sins of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry but later repented and sought to restore true worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods_and_idols.htm">Foreign gods and idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that were contrary to the worship of Yahweh, which Manasseh had initially introduced.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars_on_the_mountain.htm">Altars on the mountain</a></b><br>High places where unauthorized worship occurred, which Manasseh had constructed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant as the location of the temple and the center of Jewish worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>True repentance involves not only a change of heart but also tangible actions to remove sin and restore righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_leadership.htm">The Influence of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of their people.

By extracting the image, Manasseh restores the purity of worship commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-4.htm">Deuteronomy 12:4&#8211;5</a>.<p>&#8226; Removing what he once exalted illustrates how grace can rewrite a life story&#8212;even the worst chapters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all the altars he had built on the temple mount</b><p>&#8226; The king had erected altars &#8220;for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/21-5.htm">2 Kings 21:5</a>).

He eliminates foreign gods, removes the idol from the very temple he had violated, dismantles every unauthorized altar on the temple mount and throughout Jerusalem, and hauls the debris outside the city. The verse teaches that genuine repentance produces decisive, visible action that restores God&#8217;s rightful place and guards the community from compromise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Took away the strange gods.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/2_chronicles/33-3.htm" title="For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.">2Chronicles 33:3-7</a>.
