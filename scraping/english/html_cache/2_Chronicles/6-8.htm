In the biblical narrative, God often communicated with key figures to guide His people. David, as the king of Israel, was chosen by God to lead His people, and this communication underscores his role in God's plan. The reference to "my father David" is made by Solomon, David's son, who succeeded him as king. This connection between David and Solomon is significant in the biblical lineage, as it fulfills God's promise to establish David's throne forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), which is ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<p><b>&#8216;Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name</b><br>David's desire to build a temple for God reflects his deep devotion and commitment to honoring God. The "house for My Name" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was to be a central place of worship for the Israelites. This desire was not just a personal ambition but a spiritual aspiration to create a dwelling place for God's presence among His people. The phrase "in your heart" indicates that God values the intentions and desires of the heart, even if they are not fully realized. This aligns with biblical teachings that God looks at the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>you have done well to have this in your heart</b><br>God acknowledges and commends David for his good intentions, even though David was not the one to build the temple. This commendation highlights the importance of having a heart aligned with God's purposes. It serves as a reminder that God values our intentions and desires to serve Him, even if circumstances prevent us from carrying them out. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to have pure hearts and good intentions (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>). David's heart for God is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father and whose heart was always aligned with God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who communicates His will and desires to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who desired to build a temple for the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, who ultimately built the temple, fulfilling his father's vision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The house intended for the Name of the LORD, a central place of worship for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God as the location for His temple and the center of Jewish worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_intentions.htm">The Importance of Intentions</a></b><br>God values the intentions of our hearts.

The phrase underscores that the initiative and authority belong to the LORD, not to human ambition (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing David as &#8220;my father,&#8221; Solomon highlights generational continuity in God&#8217;s covenant purposes (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement recalls the earlier prophetic word delivered by Nathan, affirming that God alone decides how, when, and through whom His plans unfold (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;In your heart&#8221; points to David&#8217;s sincere, worship-motivated desire rather than a political or personal agenda (cf. <a href="/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;house for My Name&#8221; speaks of a dwelling where God places His reputation and presence among His people (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; God values the intent even when He redirects the task; David&#8217;s role shifts from builder to planner and provider (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/22-7.htm">1 Chronicles 22:7&#8211;10</a>; 28:11&#8211;12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have done well to have this in your heart</b><p>&#8226; God commends David&#8217;s desire, showing that motives matter as much as actions (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The affirmation assures believers that righteous intentions, even when unrealized, receive divine approval (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-10.htm">Matthew 26:10</a>; <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41&#8211;44</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s &#8220;well&#8221; is tied to obedience; he accepts God&#8217;s &#8220;no&#8221; and prepares resources for Solomon, illustrating humble submission (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/6-8.htm">2 Chronicles 6:8</a> reveals God&#8217;s esteem for David&#8217;s heartfelt desire to honor Him, even though David would not physically build the temple.
