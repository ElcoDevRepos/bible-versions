The stability of a kingdom was crucial for a new king to implement his policies and secure his reign. In the context of ancient Judah, a king needed to consolidate power to ensure loyalty among the people and the military. This moment reflects a common practice in the ancient Near East where a new ruler would first secure his position before taking significant actions. The phrase suggests that Amaziah waited until he had full control before addressing the murder of his father, King Joash, which shows a strategic approach to governance.<p><b>Amaziah executed the servants</b><br>Amaziah's execution of the servants who killed his father is an act of justice and retribution, aligning with the principle of lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, which is seen in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). This action was likely intended to restore order and demonstrate his commitment to justice, deterring future conspiracies. It also reflects the cultural and legal expectations of a king to avenge wrongful deaths, especially within the royal family. This act of execution was a common practice in ancient monarchies to eliminate threats and solidify the king's authority.<p><b>who had murdered his father the king</b><br>The murder of King Joash by his servants is recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>. Joash's assassination was a result of his turning away from God and the subsequent discontent among his officials. This historical context highlights the instability and political intrigue that often surrounded the throne of Judah. The execution of the murderers by Amaziah can be seen as fulfilling the biblical principle of justice, as well as a necessary political move to stabilize his reign. This act also serves as a reminder of the consequences of unfaithfulness to God, as Joash's downfall was linked to his abandonment of the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Joash, who began his reign by executing the servants who killed his father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>Amaziah's father, the previous king of Judah, who was assassinated by his own servants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>The individuals who conspired against and killed King Joash, leading to their execution by Amaziah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Amaziah reigned as king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/execution_of_the_servants.htm">Execution of the Servants</a></b><br>A significant event marking the beginning of Amaziah's reign, demonstrating his commitment to justice and the consolidation of his power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_leadership.htm">Justice and Leadership</a></b><br>Amaziah's actions demonstrate the importance of justice in leadership.

This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered "repair." The kal force of the word is simply to "be strong" (<a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>). The hiph., to "make strong," or "confirm," as it is rendered here, is found in <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, "in his hand," follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. <span class="cmt_word">His servants</span>. It may be held surprising that they should have been found "in the <span class="accented">place</span>," or should now be <span class="accented">his servants</span> at all.
