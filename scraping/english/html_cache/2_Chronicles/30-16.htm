The priests and Levites had specific roles and responsibilities, as outlined in the Law of Moses. This order reflects the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. The prescribed posts were likely around the altar and in the temple courts, emphasizing the sacredness of their duties. This structure is reminiscent of the order seen in the tabernacle and later in the temple, where each person had a designated role, ensuring that worship was conducted in a manner pleasing to God.<p><b>according to the Law of Moses the man of God</b><br>The reference to the Law of Moses underscores the authority and divine origin of the instructions given to the Israelites. Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, received the law directly from God on Mount Sinai. This law included detailed instructions for worship, sacrifices, and the roles of the priests and Levites. The phrase "the man of God" highlights Moses' unique relationship with God and his role as a prophet and leader. This adherence to the law signifies the importance of following God's commands precisely, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-8</a>.<p><b>The priests splattered the blood</b><br>The act of splattering the blood was a crucial part of the sacrificial system. Blood was seen as the life force, and its use in sacrifices symbolized atonement and purification. The priests, as mediators between God and the people, performed this act to cleanse and consecrate the altar and the people. This practice foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the atonement of sins, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>. The splattering of blood also connects to the Passover, where the blood of the lamb protected the Israelites from the angel of death (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>).<p><b>which they received from the hand of the Levites</b><br>The Levites played a supportive role in the sacrificial system, assisting the priests by preparing the sacrifices and handling the blood. This division of labor highlights the collaborative nature of worship and the importance of each group fulfilling their God-given roles. The Levites' involvement ensured that the priests could focus on their primary duties of offering sacrifices and interceding for the people. This cooperation is a model for the body of Christ, where each member has a unique function, as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.
