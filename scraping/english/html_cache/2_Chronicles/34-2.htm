Doing what is "right in the eyes of the LORD" implies adherence to God's commandments and a heart aligned with divine will. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the kings of Israel and Judah are often evaluated based on their faithfulness to God. Josiah's actions are contrasted with those of many of his predecessors who led the nation into idolatry and sin. His reign is marked by significant religious reforms, including the restoration of the temple and the re-establishment of the covenant, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>.<p><b>and walked in the ways of his father David</b><br>David is often considered the ideal king in the biblical narrative, a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). By walking in David's ways, Josiah is associated with a legacy of faithfulness and devotion to God. This connection underscores the importance of Davidic lineage and covenant, which is central to the messianic hope in the Old Testament. Josiah's reforms and his commitment to the Law of Moses reflect David's own dedication to God, as seen in the Psalms and his efforts to establish Jerusalem as the spiritual center of Israel.<p><b>he did not turn aside to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase signifies unwavering commitment and steadfastness in following God's commandments. It echoes the instructions given to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, where God commands him to be strong and courageous, not deviating from the law. This imagery of a straight path is used throughout scripture to describe a life of righteousness and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). Josiah's consistent adherence to God's ways, without deviation, sets a standard for leadership and personal conduct, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and integrity in one's spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at a young age and is noted for his religious reforms and dedication to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The former king of Israel, known as a man after God's own heart, whose ways Josiah followed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Josiah reigned and implemented his reforms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose commandments and ways Josiah sought to follow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reforms.htm">Reforms</a></b><br>The religious and societal changes Josiah implemented to bring Judah back to the worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>Josiah's life exemplifies the importance of remaining faithful to God, even in a culture that may not support such devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_models_in_faith.htm">Role Models in Faith</a></b><br>Just as Josiah looked to David as a model, we should seek godly examples to emulate in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_distractions.htm">Avoiding Distractions</a></b><br>The phrase "did not turn aside to the right or to the left" teaches us to stay focused on God's path, avoiding distractions and temptations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/impact_of_leadership.htm">Impact of Leadership</a></b><br>Josiah's reforms show how godly leadership can lead to significant positive changes in society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_scripture.htm">Commitment to Scripture</a></b><br>Josiah's actions were rooted in a commitment to God's Word, reminding us of the importance of Scripture in guiding our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_34_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 34:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_like_David_daily.htm">How can we "walk in the ways of David" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_stay_on_course_mean_today.htm">What does it mean to "turn aside neither right nor left" today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_example_inspire_spiritual_reform.htm">How does Josiah's example in 2 Chronicles 34:2 inspire personal spiritual reform?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Who_shows_faith_like_Josiah_in_the_Bible.htm">What other biblical figures exemplify unwavering faithfulness like Josiah?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_impact_on_our_spiritual_path.htm">How can Josiah's commitment to God influence our community's spiritual direction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_devotion_in_2_Chronicles_34_2.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 34:2 reflect Josiah's commitment to God's ways?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Josiah_s_reforms.htm">What historical evidence supports Josiah's reforms mentioned in 2 Chronicles 34:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Josiah_s_example_a_challenge_today.htm">How does Josiah's example in 2 Chronicles 34:2 challenge modern Christian leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_34.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_2_chron._28_and_2_kings_16_conflict.htm">Does King Ahaz's portrayal in 2 Chronicles 28 conflict with the account in 2 Kings 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/could_an_8-year-old_lead_and_reform.htm">(2 Chronicles 34:1) How plausible is it that an eight-year-old could rule a nation and initiate extensive reforms? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_jehoshaphat_follow_david's_ways.htm">(2 Chronicles 17:3-4) How can Jehoshaphat be said to walk in David's ways without referencing David's well-documented moral failures in earlier narratives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_inherit_david's_throne.htm">Would Jesus inherit David's throne?
