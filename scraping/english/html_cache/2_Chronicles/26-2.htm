His reign is noted for prosperity and military success. Eloth, or Elath, was a port city on the Red Sea, significant for trade and military purposes. Rebuilding Eloth indicates Uzziah's strategic focus on economic and military expansion. This act reflects his capability as a leader and his desire to restore and strengthen Judah's influence in the region.<p><b>and restored it to Judah</b><br>Restoring Eloth to Judah suggests that the city had been lost or diminished in importance prior to Uzziah's reign. This restoration signifies a reclaiming of territory and influence, aligning with the biblical theme of restoration and God's promises to His people. It also highlights Uzziah's role in fulfilling the covenantal promise of land and prosperity to the descendants of David.<p><b>after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.</b><br>King Amaziah, Uzziah's father, had a mixed reign, marked by both faithfulness and failure. His death, described as "resting with his fathers," is a common biblical euphemism for death, indicating a peaceful passing and burial with ancestors. Uzziah's actions following Amaziah's death suggest a continuation and expansion of his father's policies, but with greater success and divine favor. This transition underscores the biblical principle of generational leadership and the impact of a king's faithfulness on his successors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah (Azariah)</a></b><br>Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was the king of Judah who began his reign at the age of sixteen.
