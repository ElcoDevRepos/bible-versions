The foothills, or Shephelah, and the Negev are regions in Judah known for their strategic and agricultural importance. The Philistine raids during King Ahaz's reign were part of God's judgment on Judah for its idolatry and unfaithfulness. This reflects the cyclical pattern of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance seen throughout the history of Israel.<p><b>capturing and occupying Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth</b><br>Beth-shemesh was a Levitical city, significant in Israel's history, especially in the narrative of the Ark of the Covenant (1 Samuel 6). Aijalon was a city in the tribal territory of Dan, known for its fertile land. Gederoth is less prominent but was part of the lowland cities. The capture of these cities indicates a significant loss for Judah, both strategically and spiritually, as these areas were part of the land given by God to the Israelites.<p><b>as well as Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages</b><br>Soco and Timnah were also located in the Shephelah, with Soco being known for its role in the battle between David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17). Timnah was a city associated with Samson's exploits (Judges 14). Gimzo is mentioned only here, indicating its lesser prominence.

Their sweeping advance into Judah&#8217;s foothills and Negev, seizing key towns and their surrounding villages, illustrates the tangible consequences of covenant unfaithfulness. The verse reinforces a consistent biblical pattern: when God&#8217;s people abandon Him, protective hedges fall, and enemies possess what once belonged to His inheritance. Conversely, subsequent chapters show that repentance and godly leadership can restore what sin has lost, affirming both the justice and the mercy of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Invaded</span>--i.e., "fell upon" (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-13.htm" title="But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.">2Chronicles 25:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The low country.</span>--The sheph??<span class= "ital">?lah,</span> or lowland of Judah, between the hill-country and the Mediterranean.<p><span class= "bld">The south.</span>--<span class= "ital">The Negeb,</span> or southland of Judah, nearly co-extensive with the territory assigned to Simeon (<a href="/2_samuel/24-7.htm" title="And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.">2Samuel 24:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Beth-shemesh.</span>--See <a href="/1_chronicles/6-59.htm" title="And Ashan with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs:">1Chronicles 6:59</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Ajalon.</span>--<a href="/1_chronicles/6-69.htm" title="And Aijalon with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs:">1Chronicles 6:69</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines</span>.
