Their presence throughout Israel indicates a widespread network of religious influence and authority. Historically, the Levites were distributed among the tribes of Israel, as seen in <a href="/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>, where cities were allocated to them. This distribution ensured that religious instruction and worship were accessible to all Israelites. The movement of these religious leaders towards Rehoboam signifies a significant shift in religious allegiance, likely due to Jeroboam's establishment of idolatrous practices in the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-31</a>). This migration underscores the division between the northern and southern kingdoms and highlights the Levites' commitment to the Davidic line and the temple in Jerusalem.<p><b>stood with Rehoboam</b><br>Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, became king of Judah after the kingdom split. The phrase "stood with" indicates loyalty and support, suggesting that the priests and Levites recognized Rehoboam as the legitimate ruler in line with God's covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This allegiance is significant in the context of the divided kingdom, where the northern tribes rejected Rehoboam's rule. The support of the religious leaders would have bolstered Rehoboam's position, providing spiritual legitimacy and continuity of worship centered in Jerusalem. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, where the true worship and priesthood align with the rightful king, prefiguring the ultimate kingship and priesthood of Jesus, who fulfills the Davidic covenant and establishes a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/7-11.htm">Hebrews 7:11-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, Rehoboam's reign was marked by the division of the united kingdom of Israel into two separate kingdoms: Israel in the north and Judah in the south.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>These were the religious leaders and temple workers in Israel.

Their movement carries spiritual weight because when the spiritual leaders move, the nation follows.<p>&#8226; Their decision highlights their faithfulness to God&#8217;s prescribed worship rather than to a political kingdom. Like Phinehas who zealously guarded pure worship (<a href="/numbers/25-10.htm">Numbers 25:10&#8211;13</a>), these men refuse to compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from all their districts</b><p>&#8226; The Levites possessed forty-eight Levitical towns spread across every tribe (<a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1&#8211;8</a>). Abandoning those homes meant embracing financial loss and social upheaval.<p>&#8226; Their unified action illustrates total commitment: every district, not a handful, responded.

The verse underscores that the exodus of priests and Levites was national in scope, not limited to border regions.<p>&#8226; By leaving, they declare that true worship cannot be contained within man-made boundaries. Their example foreshadows faithful remnants who later return from exile (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood with Rehoboam</b><p>&#8226; They aligned themselves with Judah&#8217;s king because Jerusalem alone housed the temple where the LORD placed His Name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>).<p>&#8226; 2 Chron 11:14&#8211;16 explains that Jeroboam&#8217;s counterfeit priesthood (<a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33&#8211;34</a>) forced the Levites to choose. By standing with Rehoboam, they stand with covenant fidelity, not merely with a dynasty.<p>&#8226; Their presence strengthens Judah spiritually and politically for three years (2 Chron 11:17), showing how godly leadership stabilizes a nation (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13</a> records a nationwide movement of priests and Levites who, valuing the LORD&#8217;s ordained worship above everything else, leave their northern towns and rally to Rehoboam in Jerusalem. Their costly loyalty testifies that true covenant faithfulness outweighs territorial or political loyalties, and their stand becomes a means by which God preserves both right worship and the stability of Judah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(<span class= "ital">c</span>) <span class= "bld">THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES, AND ALL WHO ARE FAITHFUL TO THE LEGITIMATE WORSHIP, DESERT THE NORTHERN KINGDOM</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.">2Chronicles 11:13-17</a>).<p>This section also is peculiar to the chronicler, though indirectly confirmed by the notices in <a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm" title="After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.">1Kings 13:33</a>.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Resorted to him.</span>--<span class= "ital">Presented themselves before him</span> (<a href="/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/job/2-1.htm" title="Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.">Job 2:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priests and the Levites that were in all</span> <span class="cmt_word">Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts</span>. The emphasis thrown into the contents of this verse is evident and agreeable; the ecclesiastical party acted worthily of itself. The priests and Levites could not bring themselves to offer sacrifice and service to the calves, or to forsake Jerusalem and the temple and the true altar. No doubt a stirring, throbbing history underlay the few but suggestive words which point here the conduct of the priests and Levites.
