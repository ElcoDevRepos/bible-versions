His acts include both his successes and failures, such as his initial obedience to God and later idolatry. His reign is marked by a mixture of faithfulness and disobedience, reflecting the spiritual state of Judah during his time.<p><b>from beginning to end</b><br>This phrase suggests a comprehensive account of Amaziah's life and reign, indicating that his story is fully documented. It implies that the biblical narrative provides a complete picture of his actions, from his ascension to the throne to his eventual downfall and assassination.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to another historical source, the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel, which is often referenced in the Bible as a record of the monarchs' reigns. This book is not part of the canonical scriptures but was likely a historical document used by the biblical authors. It emphasizes the historical reliability and thorough documentation of the events described in the Bible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>Amaziah was the king of Judah, the son of Joash.

His military campaign against Edom (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>) and arrogant challenge to Israel&#8217;s King Jehoash (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17</a>) reveal how success can breed pride. The outcome was defeat, the breach of Jerusalem&#8217;s wall, and plundering of the Temple (<a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13&#8211;14</a>). God&#8217;s inspired historian pauses here to say, in effect, &#8220;There&#8217;s more to the story than we have space to tell.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from beginning to end</b><p>The Spirit-directed chronicler underscores that Amaziah&#8217;s life is fully known to God and thoroughly recorded, echoing similar statements about Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-41.htm">1 Kings 11:41</a>), Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>), and Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-22.htm">2 Chronicles 26:22</a>). The phrase reminds us that God observes and evaluates every chapter of a leader&#8217;s life, not merely the highlights. <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a> affirms that the Lord Himself is &#8220;the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End,&#8221; so He alone can assess a person&#8217;s entire story.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written</b><p>This rhetorical question, common throughout Kings and Chronicles (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/15-7.htm">1 Kings 15:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-34.htm">2 Kings 10:34</a>), asserts the certainty and accessibility of the historical record. It also invites readers to verify the chronicler&#8217;s summary, reinforcing Scripture&#8217;s trustworthiness. <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a> follows the same pattern&#8212;pointing to existing eyewitness accounts so believers may &#8220;know the certainty&#8221; of what they have been taught.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?</b><p>The &#8220;Book of the Kings&#8221; was a royal archive, now lost, from which the Holy Spirit selected precisely what the Church needs today (<a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>). Similar source citations appear for Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-27.htm">2 Chronicles 35:27</a>). That the chronicler recognizes both &#8220;Judah and Israel&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s ongoing interest in the whole covenant people, even though the kingdom had split (compare <a href="/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>). The statement also signals continuity: God&#8217;s unfolding story runs through every generation, reaching its climax in the King of Kings (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1, 17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/25-26.htm">2 Chronicles 25:26</a> serves as a Holy Spirit-inspired footnote: Amaziah&#8217;s tale is bigger than the present chapter, fully documented and fully known to God. It reassures us that Scripture rests on reliable historical foundations, reminds us that every deed&#8212;from start to finish&#8212;is weighed by the Lord, and points forward to the grand narrative of God&#8217;s kingdom that transcends any one monarch&#8217;s successes or failures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">First and last.</span>--<span class= "ital">The former and the latter.</span> The chronicler adds his usual formula.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, are they not written.</span>--The Hebrew is faulty here.

But it is possible that <span class= "ital">hinn?m</span> ("behold they") is here a corruption of <span class= "ital">h?m</span> ("they"); and that the reading of Kings should be followed, with other Hebrew MSS. and the Targum.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The book of the kings of Judah and Israel</span>.
