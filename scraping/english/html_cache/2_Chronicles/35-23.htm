His death occurred during a battle at Megiddo against Pharaoh Neco of Egypt. The archers' involvement suggests a strategic military engagement, as archers were often used to weaken or kill key figures from a distance. This event marks a significant turning point for Judah, as Josiah's death led to a rapid decline in the nation's spiritual and political state. The location, Megiddo, is historically significant as a site of many battles and is often associated with the concept of Armageddon in eschatological contexts.<p><b>who said to his servants,</b><br>Josiah's communication with his servants highlights the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where kings were supported by a retinue of loyal servants and soldiers. This phrase indicates the presence of his attendants even in the chaos of battle, reflecting the loyalty and duty expected of those serving the king.<p><b>&#8220;Take me away,</b><br>This request demonstrates Josiah's awareness of his critical condition and his desire to be removed from the battlefield, possibly to receive medical attention or to avoid capture. It reflects the human instinct for survival and the king's reliance on his servants for protection and assistance in his vulnerable state.<p><b>for I am badly wounded!&#8221;</b><br>The severity of Josiah's injuries is emphasized here, marking the tragic end of a king who had sought to restore true worship in Judah. His death can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Huldah the prophetess, who foretold that Josiah would die in peace, which can be interpreted as peace with God rather than a peaceful death. This moment foreshadows the coming judgment on Judah and serves as a reminder of the consequences of straying from God's covenant. Josiah's death also prefigures the suffering of Christ, the ultimate righteous king, who would be wounded for the transgressions of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah known for his religious reforms and dedication to the worship of Yahweh.

&#8220;There&#8221; points back to the battlefield of Megiddo (2 Chron 35:22; <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), a place already famous for decisive conflicts (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>) and&#8212;prophetically&#8212;Armageddon (<a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>). The word fixes the scene and underlines that what is about to happen is grounded in real history and geography.<p>&#8226; Josiah arrived after refusing Pharaoh Neco&#8217;s warning &#8220;from the mouth of God&#8221; (v. 22). The location therefore testifies to both the king&#8217;s courage and his failure to discern God&#8217;s voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the archers shot King Josiah</b><p>&#8226; The fatal blow comes from a distance, much like the &#8220;random&#8221; arrow that struck Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34</a>). God again proves He can direct an arrow to accomplish His purposes.<p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s reforms (2 Chron 34&#8211;35) could not cancel Judah&#8217;s coming judgment, yet the Lord had pledged to spare him from seeing the catastrophe (<a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>). His personal righteousness is unquestioned, but his decision to fight a battle God had not ordered exposes him to danger.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> explains that righteous people may be &#8220;taken away from the evil to come.&#8221; Josiah&#8217;s death, though tragic, removed him before Babylon&#8217;s invasion (2 Chron 36:17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who said to his servants</b><p>&#8226; Still conscious, the king turns to trusted aides, just as Hezekiah once turned to his servants in crisis (<a href="/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2</a>). Leadership shows in the moment of wounding: he does not panic, curse, or blame.<p>&#8226; The presence of servants highlights community; godly leaders surround themselves with people who can act when life unravels (<a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Take me away</b><p>&#8226; Josiah recognizes the battle is lost for him personally. Just as David withdrew from battle when his men insisted he not &#8220;extinguish the lamp of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), Josiah orders evacuation to preserve what remains of his life.<p>&#8226; Wisdom sometimes means retreat; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;8</a> reminds us there is &#8220;a time to fight and a time to refrain.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I am badly wounded!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase&#8212;literally &#8220;very sick&#8221;&#8212;admits the gravity of the injury. No bravado; simple truth.<p>&#8226; Like Stephen, who while dying entrusted himself to God (<a href="/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59&#8211;60</a>), Josiah faces mortality with clear eyes.<p>&#8226; Although Huldah had said he would &#8220;die in peace&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a>), peace in Old-Testament terms can describe dying before national disaster, not necessarily dying quietly in bed. The promise stands: Josiah&#8217;s death precedes Judah&#8217;s downfall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/35-23.htm">2 Chronicles 35:23</a> shows a godly king struck down because he ignored a divine warning, yet every clause confirms God&#8217;s sovereignty and Scripture&#8217;s integrity. The place, the arrow, the servants, the command, and the confession weave together to illustrate that even devoted believers must exercise discernment, that death does not nullify faithfulness, and that God unfailingly keeps both promises of mercy and warnings of judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And the archers shot.</span>--Comp. the death of Ahab (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-33.htm" title="And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn your hand, that you may carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.">2Chronicles 18:33</a>, and of Saul, <a href="/1_chronicles/10-3.htm" title="And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.">1Chronicles 10:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Have me away.</span>--LXX., <span class= "greekheb">????????? ??</span>.
