Biblically, the number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection. This period allowed Rehoboam time to consider the counsel he received, reflecting a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures where decisions were not made hastily. The three-day period also echoes other significant biblical events, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>), suggesting a time of testing followed by revelation or decision.<p><b>Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam</b><br>Jeroboam, who had been a servant of Solomon, represents the northern tribes of Israel. His return with "all the people" indicates a collective action and a unified front from the tribes seeking relief from heavy burdens imposed by Solomon. This moment is pivotal in Israel's history, as it sets the stage for the division of the kingdom. The gathering of the people reflects the communal nature of decision-making in ancient Israel, where leaders were expected to heed the voice of the people.<p><b>since the king had said, &#8220;Come back to me on the third day.&#8221;</b><br>Rehoboam's instruction to return on the third day shows his initial willingness to engage with the people's request, though it ultimately leads to a fateful decision. This directive highlights the king's authority and the expectation of a royal decree. The phrase underscores the importance of leadership and the consequences of decisions made by those in power. Rehoboam's choice to follow the harsh counsel of his younger advisors rather than the elders' advice results in the division of the kingdom, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This moment foreshadows the need for wise and compassionate leadership, ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd who listens to His people (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah.

The people honor the deadline, underlining that any coming conflict will not be because they acted rashly.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;three days&#8221; to signal pause before decisive action (<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>; <a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>). Here it heightens anticipation: will the new king heed counsel or harden his heart?<p>&#8226; The pause underscores personal accountability. Rehoboam cannot blame fatigue or pressure; he had time to seek God as David did (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>) but chose another path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam, once a servant under Solomon and now spokesman for the northern tribes (<a href="/1_kings/12-2.htm">1 Kings 12:2&#8211;3</a>), leads the delegation. Their united return shows genuine hope for relief, not rebellion.<p>&#8226; &#8220;All the people&#8221; reminds us that leadership decisions ripple through entire communities (<a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>). Rehoboam&#8217;s answer will shape national destiny.<p>&#8226; The scene fulfills prophecy: the man destined to rule ten tribes is standing before the king whose choice will open that door (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the king had said</b><p>&#8226; The people obey royal instruction (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), proving they are not contemptuous of authority. Any rupture that follows will rest on Rehoboam&#8217;s own words.<p>&#8226; The clause highlights covenant order: king speaks, people respond (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14&#8211;20</a>). Rehoboam&#8217;s forthcoming failure will therefore be a failure of covenant leadership, not of public submission.<p>&#8226; It exposes the weight of words. A ruler&#8217;s promise sets expectations (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;6</a>); breaking them invites disillusionment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Come back to me on the third day.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The invitation sounded open-minded. Rehoboam did consult&#8212;first with older advisers who counseled kindness (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-7.htm">2 Chronicles 10:7</a>), then with peers who urged harshness (10:10&#8211;11).<p>&#8226; By repeating the king&#8217;s exact quote, the narrative contrasts what was promised (a thoughtful answer) with what will be delivered (a tyrannical ultimatum).<p>&#8226; The scene warns that delayed decisions are only wise when they seek God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). Delay without humility merely postpones disaster.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 12 captures a calm before the storm. The people respectfully return on the appointed day, showing patience and expectation of just leadership. Their obedience leaves Rehoboam fully responsible for what follows. The verse therefore sets the moral stage: when a God-appointed leader ignores wise counsel and speaks harshly, division is the inevitable fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">So Jeroboam.</span>--<span class= "ital">Literatim</span> as Kings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - It may be worth observing that the history is silent of what of hope and fear or other thought and feeling transpired with Jeroboam and his party these three critical days of suspense, as also it was so silent as to what transpired with them during the three days, three weeks, three months, before the first interview with Rehoboam at Shechem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;li&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
