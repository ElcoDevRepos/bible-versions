Historically, this refers to the Israelites becoming subjugated to Shishak, the king of Egypt, as a consequence of their disobedience to God. This servitude is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God allows foreign powers to dominate Israel as a form of discipline (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God in using even foreign rulers to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>so that they may learn the difference</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the educational purpose behind the judgment. The Israelites are to gain understanding through their experience of servitude. Biblically, God often uses trials to teach His people important lessons (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>). The concept of learning through hardship is a common biblical theme, emphasizing that God's discipline is meant to bring about repentance and growth.<p><b>between serving Me</b><br>Serving God is depicted throughout Scripture as a relationship of covenant and blessing. In the context of the Old Testament, serving God involves obedience to His laws and commands, which are designed for the well-being of His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>). The service to God is characterized by freedom, peace, and prosperity when the covenant is upheld.<p><b>and serving the kings of other lands.</b><br>This phrase contrasts the service to God with the service to earthly rulers. Historically, serving foreign kings often meant harsh oppression and heavy burdens, as seen in the Israelites' experience in Egypt before the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). Theologically, this serves as a warning against idolatry and turning away from God, as such actions lead to bondage and suffering. The difference between serving God and serving human rulers is a recurring theme, emphasizing the superiority of God's rule and the futility of relying on human powers (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign is marked by a division of the kingdom and subsequent invasion by Shishak, king of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak.htm">Shishak</a></b><br>The king of Egypt who invaded Judah during Rehoboam's reign, taking treasures from the temple and the royal palace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by Rehoboam, which faced consequences due to the king's and the people's unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple of the Lord was located and which was plundered by Shishak.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Specifically, Shemaiah, who warned Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah about the consequences of their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_consequences.htm">Understanding Consequences</a></b><br>God's allowance of servitude under Shishak serves as a lesson in the consequences of turning away from Him.
