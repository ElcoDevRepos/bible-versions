Solomon, known for his wisdom, was seen as a ruler who sought to align his kingdom with God's laws. The king's command likely involved the organization and duties of the temple service, reflecting the importance of maintaining order and reverence in worship. This obedience can be compared to the Israelites' adherence to God's commands under Moses and Joshua, emphasizing continuity in leadership and divine guidance.<p><b>regarding the priests or the Levites</b><br>The priests and Levites held significant roles in Israel's religious life, responsible for temple rituals, sacrifices, and teaching the law. Their duties were established in the Mosaic Law, particularly in the books of Leviticus and Numbers. Solomon's command ensured that these roles were respected and executed properly, maintaining the sanctity of worship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's desire for a holy and orderly worship system, as seen in the detailed instructions given to Moses for the tabernacle.<p><b>in any matter</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the king's command, indicating that every aspect of the priests' and Levites' duties was covered. It suggests a meticulous approach to religious observance, ensuring that no detail was overlooked. This thoroughness can be seen as a reflection of God's own attention to detail in the laws given to Israel, emphasizing the importance of complete obedience and dedication in serving Him.<p><b>including that of the treasuries</b><br>The mention of treasuries indicates the management of the temple's financial resources, which were crucial for its maintenance and the support of the priests and Levites. Proper stewardship of these resources was essential for the functioning of the temple services. This aspect of Solomon's command highlights the importance of integrity and accountability in handling God's provisions, a principle echoed throughout Scripture, such as in the parables of Jesus concerning stewardship and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.
