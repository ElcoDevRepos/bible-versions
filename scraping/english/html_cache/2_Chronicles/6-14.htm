Solomon, as king, acts as an intercessor for the people, a role that foreshadows Christ's intercessory work.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD, God of Israel,</b><br>The invocation of the LORD, the covenant name Yahweh, emphasizes the personal relationship between God and Israel.

The prayer which this verso opens occupies twenty-eight verses; it is the longest prayer recorded in Scripture. It consists of two verses (14, 15) of opening; then follow three petitions - first, that God would perpetuate the line of David (ver. 16); <span class="accented">next</span>, that he would have regard to the place where his Name is put (vers. 17-20); and <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, that he would hear the prayers addressed to him toward this place (ver. 21). Of this last subject, seven different cases are propounded <span class="accented">- firstly</span>, the case of the man wronged by his neighbour (vers. 22, 23); <span class="accented">secondly</span>, of the people worsted by their enemies (vers. 24, 25); <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, of the people suffering from drought (vers. 26, 27); <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, of the people visited by death or special calamity (vers. 28-31); <span class="accented">fifthly</span>, of the stranger who comes to offer to pray (vers 32, 33); <span class="accented">sixthly</span>, of the people going to war by God's permission (vers. 34, 35); <span class="accented">seventhly</span>, of the people in captivity (vers. 36-39). Then the prayer closes in vers. 40-42. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and said:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
