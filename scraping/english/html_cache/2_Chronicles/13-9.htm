The sons of Aaron and the Levites were chosen by God to serve as priests and temple workers (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, <a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). By driving them out, Jeroboam was rejecting God's ordained order and authority. This act is reminiscent of other biblical instances where leaders rejected God's commands, leading to spiritual decline (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><b>And did you not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands?</b><br>Jeroboam's actions mirrored the practices of pagan nations surrounding Israel, who appointed priests without divine mandate. This was a direct violation of God's law, which specified that only descendants of Aaron could serve as priests (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>). This syncretism with pagan practices led Israel into idolatry, as seen in the golden calves Jeroboam set up in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme of Israel's struggle with idolatry and the influence of surrounding nations (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>).<p><b>Now whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of things that are not gods.</b><br>This phrase highlights the ease with which anyone could become a priest under Jeroboam's rule, contrasting sharply with the rigorous requirements for the Levitical priesthood (<a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8:1-36</a>). The offering of a young bull and seven rams, while significant, was insufficient for true consecration according to God's standards. This practice underscores the spiritual corruption and idolatry prevalent in the northern kingdom, as these priests served false gods, not the LORD. This situation foreshadows the ultimate judgment and exile of Israel due to their persistent idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is speaking in this passage.

Abijah highlights three failures: expelling the legitimate Levites, installing self-appointed priests, and reducing consecration to a cash transaction&#8212;all leading the nation to worship lifeless idols instead of the living LORD. The verse warns that true worship demands God&#8217;s way, God&#8217;s servants, and God&#8217;s standards; any substitute ends in spiritual bankruptcy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The priests of the Lord . . . and the Levites.</span>--The Hebrew seems to include the Levites among the priests of the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Cast out.</span>--<span class= "ital">Banished</span> (<a href="/jeremiah/8-3.htm" title="And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places where I have driven them, said the LORD of hosts.">Jeremiah 8:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">After the manner of the nations of other lands.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">like the peoples of the lands;</span> that is, priests of all classes of the nation, and not members of the divinely chosen tribe of Levi.

The surrounding heathen had no exclusive sacerdotal castes.<p><span class= "bld">So that whosoever cometh . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">every one that cometh, that they may fill his hand, with a steer, son of a herd, and seven rams, becometh a priest unto non-gods.</span> "To fill a man's hand" was the legal phrase for giving him authority and instituting him as a priest. (See <a href="/exodus/28-41.htm" title="And you shall put them on Aaron your brother, and his sons with him; and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-9.htm" title="And you shall gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and you shall consecrate Aaron and his sons.">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>.) Every one that came with the prescribed sacrifices (see Exodus 29) was admissible to the new priesthood. The phrase "a young bullock and seven rams" is not a full account of the sacrifices required by the law of Moses for the consecration of a priest. Perhaps Abijah did not care to be exact; but it is quite possible that Jeroboam had modified the Mosaic rule. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But did you not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">drive out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hid&#183;da&#7717;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5080.htm">Strong's 5080: </a> </span><span class="str2">To impel, thrust, banish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priests</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the descendants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the Levites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
