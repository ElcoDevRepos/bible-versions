Jehoram, the king of Judah, had engaged in numerous acts of idolatry and wickedness, including the murder of his brothers and leading the people of Judah astray. This context is crucial as it sets the stage for the divine judgment that follows. The phrase suggests a culmination of Jehoram's actions and God's response to them, emphasizing the cause-and-effect relationship between sin and divine retribution.<p><b>the LORD afflicted Jehoram</b><br>The use of "the LORD" highlights the direct involvement of God in the events described. This affliction is portrayed as a divine judgment, consistent with the covenantal relationship between God and the people of Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience to God's laws. The affliction serves as a fulfillment of the prophetic warning given by Elijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>), demonstrating God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>with an incurable disease</b><br>The term "incurable" underscores the severity and finality of the judgment. In the ancient Near Eastern context, diseases were often seen as manifestations of divine displeasure. The incurability of the disease signifies that no human intervention could reverse God's judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of Jehoram's sins and the irreversible nature of divine punishment once decreed.<p><b>of the bowels</b><br>Diseases of the bowels were particularly feared in ancient times due to their painful and debilitating nature. This specific affliction may symbolize the internal corruption and moral decay of Jehoram's reign. The physical suffering mirrors the spiritual and moral consequences of his actions. In a broader biblical context, such afflictions often serve as a metaphor for the internal consequences of sin, reflecting the biblical theme that sin leads to death and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Jehoshaphat, who turned away from the ways of his father and led Judah into idolatry and wickedness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Jehoram reigned.

Earlier in the chapter he had:<p>&#8226; slaughtered his own brothers (2 Chron 21:4)<p>&#8226; led Judah into idolatry, building high places (v. 11)<p>&#8226; ignored a prophetic warning delivered in a letter from Elijah (vv. 12-15)<p>God had already stirred surrounding nations against him (vv. 16-17). &#8220;Whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).

His actions are never arbitrary; they arise from holy righteousness.
