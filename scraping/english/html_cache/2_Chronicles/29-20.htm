It reflects a sense of priority and dedication to the task at hand, which is consistent with the biblical principle of seeking God first (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). The early morning is often associated with devotion and seeking God's guidance, as seen in the practices of other biblical figures like David (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p><b>King Hezekiah</b><br>Hezekiah was the 13th king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the kingdom. His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. Hezekiah is often remembered for his religious reforms, which included reopening the temple and reinstating the Passover. His actions are seen as a fulfillment of the covenantal promise that God would bless those who follow His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<p><b>gathered the city officials</b><br>This gathering of officials signifies the importance of communal and national involvement in religious reform. It highlights the role of leadership in guiding the people back to God. The officials likely included priests, Levites, and other leaders who had influence over the spiritual and civic life of Judah. This collective action underscores the biblical principle of unity in worship and the importance of leaders setting a godly example (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p><b>and went up to the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Going up to the temple signifies an act of reverence and obedience to God's command to worship Him in the designated holy place (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>). The temple was not only a physical structure but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. Hezekiah's ascent to the temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who also went up to Jerusalem to fulfill His mission (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship in the temple.
