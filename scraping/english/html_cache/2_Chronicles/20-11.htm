Historically, the Israelites had shown kindness to the descendants of Lot, the Ammonites and Moabites, by not attacking them during their journey to the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9, 19</a>). The current aggression from these nations is seen as a betrayal of that past mercy. This highlights a recurring biblical theme where God's people face opposition despite their previous acts of kindness, echoing the experiences of Jesus Christ, who was also repaid with hostility despite His acts of love and healing.<p><b>by coming to drive us out</b><br>The threat of being driven out of their land was a significant concern for the Israelites, as the land was central to their identity and covenant with God. The land was not just a physical territory but a divine promise fulfilled, a place where they could worship God freely. This phrase underscores the existential threat posed by the invading armies, which sought to disrupt the Israelites' relationship with God by removing them from the land He had given them.<p><b>of the possession that You gave us</b><br>The land of Canaan was a divine gift to the Israelites, promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This possession was not merely a territorial claim but a fulfillment of God's covenant, symbolizing His faithfulness and the Israelites' chosen status. The emphasis on God as the giver of the land reinforces the idea that any attempt to take it away is not just an attack on Israel but an affront to God's sovereignty and promises.<p><b>as an inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance in the Bible often carries a spiritual dimension, representing not only physical land but also the blessings and responsibilities of being God's chosen people. This inheritance was meant to be passed down through generations, signifying a lasting relationship with God. The threat to this inheritance is thus a threat to the continuity of God's promises and the spiritual legacy of the Israelites. This idea of inheritance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), inheriting the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who is leading the nation in prayer and seeking God's guidance in the face of a vast enemy army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing a coalition of enemies threatening their land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites,_ammonites,_and_meunites.htm">Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites</a></b><br>The coalition of enemy nations coming against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The place where Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah gathered to seek the Lord's help.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>Refers to the land given by God to the Israelites, a central theme in the Old Testament representing God's promise and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's prayer is rooted in the belief that God is faithful to His promises.

The king&#8217;s words model honest lament&#8212;naming sin plainly without bitterness, trusting God to judge justly (<a href="/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by coming to drive us out</b><p>He identifies the invaders&#8217;

Scripture pictures Satanic opposition similarly&#8212;schemes aimed at uprooting God&#8217;s people (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat refuses to minimize danger;

therefore the enemy strikes where identity is anchored (<a href="/psalms/79-1.htm">Psalm 79:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, salvation in Christ is likewise a present possession, not merely a future hope (<a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that You gave us</b><p>Jehoshaphat stresses divine ownership and gift.<p>&#8226;

Threats to the inheritance challenge God&#8217;s faithfulness; therefore defending it upholds His own reputation (<a href="/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, believers receive &#8220;an inheritance that is imperishable&#8221;
