The Israelites, referring to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, were at war with Judah, the Southern Kingdom. The capture of 200,000 people highlights the severity of the conflict and the internal strife among the tribes of Israel, who were originally united under kings like David and Solomon. The term "kinsmen" underscores the tragic nature of this civil war, as these were fellow descendants of Jacob. The taking of women and children as captives was a common practice in ancient warfare, often intended to weaken the enemy and assimilate the captives into the victor's society. This act of taking captives is reminiscent of the consequences outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-41.htm">Deuteronomy 28:41</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to such calamities.<p><b>They also carried off a great deal of plunder</b><br>The plundering of Judah by Israel signifies not only a military victory but also a stripping away of resources and wealth. In the ancient Near East, plunder was a common outcome of warfare, serving as both a reward for the victors and a means to cripple the defeated. This act of taking plunder can be seen as a fulfillment of the curses for disobedience found in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29-33</a>, where God warns that enemies will take away the fruits of the land and labor. The plunder would have included livestock, goods, and possibly sacred items, further emphasizing the humiliation and loss experienced by Judah.<p><b>and brought it to Samaria.</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri and later fortified by King Ahab. Bringing the captives and plunder to Samaria indicates the centralization of power and wealth in the capital city. Samaria was a significant city both politically and religiously, often associated with idolatry and apostasy, as seen in the actions of its kings. The mention of Samaria also foreshadows its eventual downfall and the Assyrian conquest, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/hosea/13-16.htm">Hosea 13:16</a>. The act of bringing the spoils to Samaria can be seen as a temporary triumph that ultimately leads to further judgment upon Israel for their own unfaithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The northern kingdom of Israel, who were at war with the southern kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Ahaz.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, ruled by King Ahaz, who was known for his unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, where the captives and plunder were taken.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah at the time, whose idolatry and disobedience led to God's judgment upon Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/captives.htm">Captives</a></b><br>200,000 women, sons, and daughters from Judah taken by the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The capture of 200,000 people from Judah serves as a stark reminder of the severe consequences of turning away from God.

God&#8217;s judgment is always purposeful&#8212;even painful events press His people to repentance (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from their kinsmen&#8212;women, sons, and daughters</b><p>The captives were &#8220;kinsmen,&#8221; fellow descendants of Abraham.

Spoils became trophies of victory rather than resources dedicated to the LORD (contrast <a href="/numbers/31-48.htm">Numbers 31:48-50</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Judah had been plundered by Syria (2 Chron 28:5) and Edom (v 17); now Israel joined the cycle.

The verse exposes the terrible cost of covenant unfaithfulness, the cruelty that arises when family forgets its shared identity, and the greed that flourishes in hearts estranged from God. Yet the larger narrative shows the LORD&#8217;s mercy: He rebukes, corrects, and offers a path to repentance and restoration. God&#8217;s people today are called to heed these lessons&#8212;guarding unity, protecting the vulnerable, and refusing to profit from a brother&#8217;s downfall&#8212;because obedience brings blessing, while disobedience always steals, kills, and destroys.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Of their brethren.</span>--Heightening the barbarity of the deed.

The number of the text is thus corroborated from a foreign and wholly unrelated source.
