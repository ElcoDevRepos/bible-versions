This reflects the dangerous influence of ungodly alliances, as Athaliah was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, known for their idolatry and opposition to God. The importance of seeking godly counsel is emphasized throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which warns of the consequences of following ungodly advice.<p><b>and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel</b><br>Joram, also known as Jehoram, was the king of Israel and the son of Ahab, continuing the legacy of his father's idolatrous reign. The alliance between Ahaziah and Joram signifies a political and familial connection between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, despite their spiritual divergence. This partnership is a reminder of the dangers of compromising with those who do not follow God's ways, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, which advises against being unequally yoked with unbelievers.<p><b>to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead</b><br>Hazael was the king of Aram (Syria), a frequent adversary of Israel. Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River, often contested between Israel and Aram. The battle at Ramoth-gilead is a continuation of the conflicts that plagued the region, highlighting the ongoing struggle for power and territory. This location is significant in biblical history, as it was also the site where Ahab, Joram's father, was mortally wounded (<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29-34</a>).<p><b>But the Arameans wounded Joram</b><br>Joram's wounding by the Arameans serves as a turning point in the narrative, illustrating the consequences of alliances formed on ungodly foundations. This event foreshadows the eventual downfall of Joram and the house of Ahab, fulfilling the prophecy against Ahab's lineage (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-22</a>).
