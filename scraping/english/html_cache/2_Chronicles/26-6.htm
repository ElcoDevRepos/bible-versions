His decision to wage war against the Philistines reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a rivalry that dates back to the time of the Judges and King David. The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel, often encroaching on their territory. Uzziah's military campaigns were part of his efforts to secure and expand Judah's borders, demonstrating his strength and leadership. This action aligns with the divine mandate given to Israel to possess the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p><b>and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod</b><br>Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod were major Philistine cities. Tearing down their walls was a strategic move to weaken the Philistines' defense and assert dominance. Gath is historically significant as the home of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>). Ashdod was a center of Philistine worship, notably of the god Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5:1-7</a>). The destruction of these walls symbolizes the breaking of Philistine power and influence. This act of tearing down walls is reminiscent of Joshua's conquest of Canaan, where cities were taken and their defenses dismantled (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>).<p><b>Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines</b><br>Building cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines indicates Uzziah's strategy to establish a permanent presence in the region, ensuring control and stability. This action reflects a common practice of ancient Near Eastern kings to fortify their borders and secure newly conquered territories. It also suggests a period of prosperity and expansion under Uzziah's reign, as he was able to invest in infrastructure and urban development. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God's people establishing themselves in the land promised to them, as seen in the settlement patterns during the time of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his military prowess and innovations.

Uzziah&#8217;s campaign is therefore part of a long story of Israel pushing back pagan influence and defending covenant land.<p>&#8226; 2 Chron 26:7 confirms, &#8220;God helped him against the Philistines,&#8221; underscoring that the triumph came from divine enablement, not merely strategy or manpower.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he tore down the walls of Gath</b><p>&#8226; Walls represented strength and security (<a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>). By literally demolishing Gath&#8217;s defenses, Uzziah neutralized a chief Philistine stronghold&#8212;Gath being the hometown of Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>) and earlier seized by kings like Rehoboam (2 Chron 11:8).<p>&#8226; The action fulfills God&#8217;s promise to give Israel victory over hostile nations when they walk in obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jabneh</b><p>&#8226; Also called Jabneel (<a href="/joshua/15-11.htm">Joshua 15:11</a>), this coastal city guarded trade routes.

Although the book of Kings passes over the facts recorded here, they are essential to forming a right conception of the strength and importance of the southern kingdom during the age of Uzziah and Jotham; and they are fully corroborated, not only by comparison with the data of Isaiah (Isaiah 2-4) upon the same subject, but also by the independent testimony of the cuneiform inscriptions of the period. (See Note on <a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 14:28</a>.) Thus we find that the warlike Assyrian Tiglath-pileser II. chastised Hamath for its alliance with Judah during this reign, but abstained from molesting Uzziah himself--"a telling proof," as Schrader says, <span class= "ital">"</span>for the accuracy of the Biblical account of Uzziah's well-founded power." The name of Uzziah is conspicuously absent from the list of western princes who, in B.C. 738, sent tribute to Tiglath: Hystaspes (<span class= "ital">Kushtashpi</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> king of Commagene (<span class= "ital">Kummuha'a</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> Rezin, king of the country of the Damascenes, Menahem of the city of the Samaritans, Hiram of the city of the Tyrians, Sibitti-bi'li of the city of the Giblites or Byblos, Urikki of Kui, Pisiris of Carchemish, Eniel of Hamath, Panammu of Sam'al, and nine other sovereigns, including those of Tabal and Arabia. The list thus comprises Hittites and Arameans, princes of Hither Asia, Phoenicia, and Arabia. The omission of Uzziah argues that the king of Judah felt himself strong enough to sustain the shock of collision with Assyria in case of need. He must have reckoned on the support of the surrounding states (also not mentioned in the above list), viz., Ashdod, Ascalon, Gaza, Edom, Ammon, Moab, &c. (Schrader, <span class= "ital">Keilinschr.,</span> p. 252, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(6) <span class= "bld">And he went forth and warred against the Philistines.</span>--At the outset of his reign this able prince had given promise of his future by seizing and fortifying the port of Elath, and thus probably completing the subjugation of Edom, which his father had more than begun. Afterwards he assumed the offensive against the Philistines, Arabs, and Maonites, who had invaded the country under his predecessors (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:">2Chronicles 21:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2Chronicles 20:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines</span>.
