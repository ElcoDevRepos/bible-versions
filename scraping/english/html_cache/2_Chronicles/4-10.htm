It was a significant feature in Solomon's Temple, symbolizing purification and the cleansing necessary for approaching God. This basin was made of cast metal and held a large quantity of water, emphasizing the importance of ritual purity in worship.<p><b>on the south side,</b><br>The placement of the Sea on the south side of the temple is significant. In ancient Near Eastern culture, directions held symbolic meanings. The south side may have been chosen for practical reasons related to the temple's layout or for symbolic reasons, possibly representing warmth, light, or life, as the south is associated with the sun's path. This placement also aligns with the temple's overall design, which was meticulously planned to reflect divine order.<p><b>at the southeast corner.</b><br>The specific mention of the southeast corner further emphasizes the intentionality in the temple's design. The southeast corner would have been a prominent location, possibly chosen for its visibility or accessibility. This placement might also have practical implications for the flow of water or the movement of priests during rituals. The southeast direction could symbolize a new beginning or renewal, as it is the direction from which the sun rises, aligning with themes of purification and new life found in the temple's rituals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Solomon followed divinely revealed plans passed from David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8211; The verbs in the temple narrative consistently stress obedience: furniture is &#8220;set,&#8221;

<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical note: the laver&#8217;s position gave priests easy access between the altar (where blood was shed) and the Holy Place (where fellowship occurred)&#8212;a vivid picture of cleansing standing between sacrifice and communion (<a href="/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the southeast corner</b><p>&#8211;

<a href="/zechariah/10-4.htm">Zechariah 10:4</a>).
