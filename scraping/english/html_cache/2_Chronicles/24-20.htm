The Spirit of God coming upon someone is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, signifying empowerment for a specific task or message (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>). Zechariah, being the son of Jehoiada, connects him to a lineage of faithful service to God, as Jehoiada was instrumental in preserving the Davidic line and restoring true worship in Judah (2 Chronicles 23). This divine empowerment underscores the seriousness and authenticity of Zechariah's message.<p><b>who stood up before the people and said to them</b><br>Zechariah's act of standing before the people indicates a public declaration, emphasizing the importance and urgency of his message. Prophets often delivered messages publicly to ensure that the entire community heard God's word, as seen with other prophets like Elijah and Jeremiah. This public setting also reflects the courage required to confront the people, especially when delivering a message of rebuke.<p><b>&#8220;This is what God says:</b><br>This phrase introduces the prophetic message with authority, indicating that the words to follow are not Zechariah's own but are directly from God. This formula is common in prophetic literature, establishing the divine origin of the message (e.g., "Thus says the LORD" in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel). It serves to remind the audience of the seriousness and divine authority behind the message.<p><b>&#8216;Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper?</b><br>The question posed by Zechariah addresses the people's disobedience to God's laws. Transgressing the commandments refers to violating the covenantal laws given to Israel, which were meant to guide them in righteousness and ensure their prosperity (Deuteronomy 28). The connection between obedience and prosperity is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where blessings are contingent upon faithfulness to God's commands (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>).<p><b>Because you have forsaken the LORD,</b><br>Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate turning away from God and His covenant. This abandonment often led to idolatry and moral decay, as seen throughout Israel's history. The language echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>, where forsaking God results in dire consequences. This phrase highlights the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where faithfulness is expected.<p><b>He has forsaken you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The consequence of forsaking God is His withdrawal of protection and blessing, a theme consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. This statement serves as a warning and a call to repentance, emphasizing that God's presence and favor are conditional upon the people's faithfulness. The forsaking by God is not arbitrary but a response to the people's actions, reflecting the justice and holiness of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The son of Jehoiada the priest, Zechariah was a prophet who boldly spoke God's truth to the people of Judah.

Like Elijah facing Israel on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>) or Peter addressing Jerusalem at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>), Zechariah refuses to stay silent when God&#8217;s honor is at stake.<p>&#8226; The setting is public. Sin flourished openly in Judah, so rebuke had to be equally open (<a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). God still calls believers to loving but plain confrontation when a community drifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This is what God says:&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The familiar prophetic formula &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; signals that the coming words carry divine weight (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By prefacing his rebuke this way, Zechariah reminds the crowd that they are accountable not to a fellow human but to their covenant Lord (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Today Scripture serves the same role: when we read it, God Himself addresses us (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question exposes the self-destructive nature of sin.
