After experiencing God's miraculous deliverance from the Assyrian army and healing from a terminal illness, Hezekiah's heart became lifted up. Pride is often highlighted in Scripture as a precursor to downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This pride can be seen as a failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty and grace, a common human failing that leads to spiritual and sometimes physical consequences.<p><b>Hezekiah did not repay the favor shown to him</b><br>Hezekiah's failure to respond appropriately to God's mercy and blessings is a critical point. The "favor" refers to God's deliverance and healing, which should have led to gratitude and humility. Instead, Hezekiah's actions suggest ingratitude. This mirrors the biblical principle that to whom much is given, much is required (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>). The expectation is that blessings from God should lead to a life of obedience and thankfulness.<p><b>Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>The consequence of Hezekiah's pride was divine wrath, not only affecting him but also extending to the nation of Judah and its capital, Jerusalem. This reflects the biblical concept of corporate responsibility, where the leader's actions impact the entire community. The wrath mentioned here can be understood as God's righteous judgment, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. It serves as a warning that sin, especially pride, can have far-reaching effects. This also foreshadows the eventual Babylonian exile, a result of continued disobedience and pride among the leaders and people of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who experienced God's deliverance from the Assyrian threat and healing from illness.
