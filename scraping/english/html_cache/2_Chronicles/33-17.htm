Despite reforms by kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who sought to centralize worship in Jerusalem, the people persisted in using these sites. High places were typically elevated sites or hilltops where altars were built, often associated with Canaanite religious practices. The persistence of this practice reflects the deep-rooted cultural and religious traditions that were difficult to eradicate, even when they conflicted with the centralized worship of Yahweh in the temple.<p><b>but only to the LORD their God</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a significant shift in the religious practices of the people. While they continued to use high places, their worship was directed solely to Yahweh, the God of Israel, rather than to foreign deities. This suggests a partial reform or compromise, where the people maintained traditional worship sites but redirected their devotion to the God of their ancestors. This reflects the ongoing struggle in Israel's history to maintain pure worship amidst surrounding pagan influences. It also underscores the importance of intention in worship, as the people sought to honor God, albeit in a manner not fully aligned with the prescribed temple worship. This can be seen as a step towards the monotheistic worship that characterized later Jewish practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry but later repented and sought to restore true worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites where people offered sacrifices, often associated with idol worship, but in this context, used for worshiping Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Manasseh reigned and where the events of this passage took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_reform.htm">Repentance and Reform</a></b><br>The period during which Manasseh turned back to God, removed idols, and attempted to restore proper worship practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_their_god.htm">The LORD their God</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the God of Israel, whom the people were attempting to worship, albeit imperfectly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Even when intentions are good, worship practices that deviate from God's instructions can lead to spiritual compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_centralized_worship.htm">The Importance of Centralized Worship</a></b><br>God desires worship to be conducted according to His guidelines, emphasizing the need for a central place of worship, as seen in the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_partial_obedience.htm">Repentance and Partial Obedience</a></b><br>Manasseh's account shows that while repentance is crucial, partial obedience can still lead to spiritual pitfalls.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_worship.htm">The Role of Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>Leaders have a significant influence on the spiritual direction of their people, as seen in Manasseh's reforms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_grace_and_patience.htm">God's Grace and Patience</a></b><br>Despite the people's continued use of high places, God's grace is evident in His willingness to accept their imperfect worship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_33_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 33:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_sacrifices_persist_post-reforms.htm">How did the people continue sacrificing despite Manasseh's reforms in 2 Chronicles 33:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_33_17_on_partial_obedience.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 33:17 reveal about incomplete obedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_worship_with_God_s_commands_7.htm">How can we ensure our worship aligns with God's commands, unlike in 33:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_33_17_lessons_for_today_s_worship.htm">What lessons from 2 Chronicles 33:17 apply to modern Christian worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_33_17_Ex_20_3_connection.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:17 connect with the First Commandment in Exodus 20:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_continue_sacrifices_at_high_places.htm">Why did the people continue sacrificing at the high places in 2 Chronicles 33:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_33_17_on_Manasseh_s_reforms.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:17 reflect on the effectiveness of Manasseh's reforms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_33_17_on_Israelite_idolatry.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 33:17 reveal about the persistence of idolatry among the Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_33.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_2_chron._28_and_2_kings_16_conflict.htm">Does King Ahaz's portrayal in 2 Chronicles 28 conflict with the account in 2 Kings 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/ezekiel_6_2-3__literal_mountains'_fate.htm">In Ezekiel 6:2&#8211;3, how can an address to literal mountains make sense, and is there any historical or archaeological record of a catastrophe specifically targeting these mountains?

Manasseh had torn down idols and repaired the altar (2 Chron 33:15&#8211;16), yet&#8212;despite his reforms&#8212;there remained an area of incomplete obedience.<p>- Scripture often records such &#8220;yet&#8221; moments in otherwise positive narratives (<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>). They remind us that revival in leadership does not instantly erase entrenched habits among the people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people still sacrificed</b><p>- Corporate worship lagged behind the king&#8217;s personal repentance. Public behavior can trail behind private conviction (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p>- God had already declared that obedience outweighs mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11&#8211;17</a>). By persisting in their customary pattern, the people revealed partial submission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the high places</b><p>- &#8220;High places&#8221; were elevated sites originally hijacked for pagan rites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). Even when redirected toward the LORD, they remained outside the divinely chosen temple location (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;6</a>; 2 Chron 6:6).<p>- God&#8217;s requirement was centralized worship in Jerusalem&#8212;a safeguard against syncretism.

Reformation was under way.<p>- Similar partial steps appear in Asa&#8217;s reign, where the high places lingered though the king&#8217;s heart was loyal (2 Chron 15:17). God honors movement in the right direction while still calling for full compliance (<a href="/philippians/3-16.htm">Philippians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the LORD their God</b><p>- The covenant name, &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; underscores that the people recognized the true God (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>).<p>- Yet location mattered as much as intention.

Right deity plus wrong venue equaled incomplete obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Manasseh&#8217;s personal revival produced genuine reforms, yet the culture retained old habits: sacrifices continued on familiar hilltops even though offered solely to the LORD. The verse teaches that partial obedience&#8212;right God, wrong place&#8212;falls short of God&#8217;s full standard.
