This context is significant as Micaiah is known for his commitment to truth, contrasting with the false prophets who seek to please the king. His role as a prophet is to convey God's message, regardless of its popularity or acceptance.<p><b>Therefore hear the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and divine origin of Micaiah's message. In the biblical context, "the word of the LORD" signifies a direct revelation from God, underscoring the seriousness and truthfulness of the prophecy. It is a call to listen and heed God's message, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>I saw the LORD sitting on His throne</b><br>This vision of God on His throne is a powerful image of divine sovereignty and authority. It reflects similar visions found in <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>, where God's majesty and rule over the universe are depicted. The throne symbolizes judgment and kingship, affirming God's ultimate control over earthly and heavenly affairs.<p><b>and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left</b><br>The "host of heaven" refers to the angelic beings who serve God. This imagery suggests a celestial court, with angels ready to execute God's will. The positioning on the right and left indicates their readiness to serve and the orderliness of God's kingdom. This scene parallels other biblical passages, such as <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, where heavenly beings are depicted as attending to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah.htm">Micaiah</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who is known for speaking the truth, even when it is unpopular or dangerous.
