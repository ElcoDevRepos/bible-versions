Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun were prominent leaders among these musicians, and their descendants continued this tradition. Asaph is noted for his role in the Psalms, contributing to the worship and liturgical life of Israel. The mention of "the king's seer" highlights the prophetic aspect of their ministry, as music and prophecy were often intertwined in Israel's worship.

Their role was crucial during festivals when the temple was crowded. The fact that they did not need to leave their posts indicates a well-organized system where other Levites supported them by preparing their portions of the sacrifices.
