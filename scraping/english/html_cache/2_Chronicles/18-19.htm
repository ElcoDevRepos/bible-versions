Such scenes are found elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>, where God interacts with spiritual beings. This highlights God's sovereignty and His active role in the affairs of nations and leaders.<p><b>&#8216;Who will entice Ahab king of Israel</b><br>Ahab was the seventh king of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of God, particularly Elijah. His reign is detailed in <a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16-22</a>. The use of the word "entice" suggests a divine strategy to bring about Ahab's downfall, reflecting the biblical theme of God using various means to accomplish His purposes, even through human or spiritual agents.<p><b>to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?&#8217;</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. It was a site of conflict between Israel and Aram (Syria). The phrase "fall at Ramoth-gilead" indicates a prophetic declaration of Ahab's defeat and death, which is fulfilled in <a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29-37</a>. This reflects the biblical principle of divine justice and the consequences of disobedience to God.<p><b>And one suggested this, and another that.</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the deliberation among the spiritual beings in God's presence, showing a diversity of opinions and plans. It emphasizes the concept of free will among spiritual entities and the ultimate authority of God in choosing the course of action. This scene parallels the idea of God allowing human and spiritual agents to participate in His plans, as seen in other biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who is orchestrating events and seeking counsel in the heavenly realm.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to God's prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth-gilead.htm">Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>A strategic city east of the Jordan River, often contested between Israel and Aram.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_council.htm">Heavenly Council</a></b><br>A divine assembly where God interacts with spiritual beings to carry out His will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/enticement.htm">Enticement</a></b><br>The act of persuading or leading someone into a particular course of action, in this case, Ahab's downfall.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of all events, even those involving human decisions and actions.
