Distress here refers to the period of turmoil and oppression faced by the people due to their disobedience and idolatry. Historically, this could relate to the invasions and threats from surrounding nations. The distress serves as a catalyst for repentance and seeking God, a pattern seen throughout the book of Judges and other historical books.<p><b>they turned to the LORD</b><br>Turning to the LORD signifies repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness. This act of turning is a conscious decision to abandon idolatry and sin, and to seek God's guidance and help. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be their protector and provider if they remain faithful. This turning is a key aspect of the Deuteronomic cycle of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This title emphasizes the unique relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It underscores God's role as the covenant God who chose Israel as His people. The phrase also distinguishes the LORD from the false gods of the surrounding nations, reinforcing the monotheistic faith of Israel. The God of Israel is portrayed as sovereign, faithful, and just, attributes that are central to His identity throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and sought Him</b><br>Seeking God involves earnest prayer, worship, and a desire to know and follow His will. This action is often accompanied by humility and a recognition of one's dependence on God. In the historical context, seeking God would include returning to the practices of the Law, such as sacrifices and observance of religious festivals. It is a demonstration of faith and trust in God's ability to deliver and restore.<p><b>and He was found by them</b><br>This phrase assures that God is accessible and responsive to those who earnestly seek Him. It reflects the promise found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where God promises to be found by those who seek Him with all their heart. This finding is not just a return to peace and prosperity but also a spiritual renewal and a deeper relationship with God. It highlights God's grace and willingness to forgive and restore His people when they turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>- The King of Judah during the time of this scripture.
