The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people. The idea of God's "eyes" being open suggests His watchfulness and care. In biblical context, God's eyes are often associated with His omniscience and protection (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). The request for day and night vigilance underscores the need for God's constant presence, echoing the promise of His perpetual covenant with Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>).<p><b>toward the place where You said You would put Your Name</b><br>The "place" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which God chose as the dwelling for His Name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name represented one's character and presence. By placing His Name there, God was signifying His special relationship with Israel and His commitment to dwell among them. This is a fulfillment of the promise made to David regarding a permanent house for God's Name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). The temple thus becomes a focal point for worship and a symbol of God's covenant faithfulness.<p><b>so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place</b><br>Solomon emphasizes the temple as a place of prayer, where God would hear the petitions of His people. The direction of prayer "toward this place" signifies the temple's role as a mediator between God and Israel. This reflects the belief that God's presence in the temple made it a conduit for divine-human interaction. The concept of praying toward a holy place is seen in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel prays facing Jerusalem. This anticipates the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), where believers approach God through Christ, the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where God's presence was to dwell, symbolizing His covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Almighty, who is being petitioned by Solomon to be attentive to the prayers made in or toward the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, for whom the temple serves as a central place of worship and divine encounter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is located, considered the spiritual center for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_name.htm">God's Presence and Name</a></b><br>The temple was a physical representation of God's presence among His people.

Solomon believes God literally honors the structure, just as He honored the tabernacle&#8217;s glory cloud (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, God affirms the request: &#8220;My eyes and My heart will be there for all time&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Toward the place where You said You would put Your Name</b><p>&#8226; God had chosen a specific geographic site to reveal His covenant presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Name&#8221; points to His character and authority; placing His Name means He personally identifies with the temple (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal choice of Jerusalem validates God&#8217;s faithfulness to earlier promises made to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that You may hear the prayer</b><p>&#8226; The purpose of divine attentiveness is relational, not merely observational. The Lord is &#8220;You who hear prayer&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/65-2.htm">Psalm 65:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon anticipates future petitions, confident that God will act when He hears (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> foresees this same temple as &#8220;a house of prayer for all nations,&#8221; reinforcing the intent that God&#8217;s ear remains open.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That Your servant prays toward this place</b><p>&#8226; Solomon models personal humility, calling himself &#8220;Your servant&#8221; (similar in <a href="/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Facing the temple becomes a physical expression of faith; centuries later Daniel prays toward Jerusalem even in exile (<a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; While the location mattered then, Jesus later shifts the focus to worship &#8220;in spirit and in truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>), yet the principle of directing one&#8217;s heart toward God&#8217;s appointed revelation endures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s plea in <a href="/2_chronicles/6-20.htm">2 Chronicles 6:20</a> is a literal, heartfelt request that God keep vigilant watch over the temple at all times, honor His declared choice of Jerusalem, and respond graciously to every prayer offered toward that sacred place. The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness, His willingness to dwell among His people, and His readiness to hear and act.
