The kings of Israel, particularly from the house of Ahab, were notorious for their worship of Baal and other pagan deities, which was in direct violation of the covenant with Yahweh. This behavior contrasts with the expected conduct of a Davidic king, who was to follow the ways of the Lord as outlined in the Law of Moses. The phrase highlights a departure from the faithfulness of Jehoram's ancestors, such as David and Asa, who sought to uphold the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and have caused Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves,</b><br>The term "prostitute" is often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness or idolatry. By leading Judah and Jerusalem into idolatry, Jehoram caused the people to break their covenant with God, akin to marital infidelity. This mirrors the actions of Ahab and Jezebel in Israel, who led the nation into Baal worship. The spiritual decline of Judah under Jehoram's reign is significant because Jerusalem was the center of worship for Yahweh, housing the Temple built by Solomon.<p><b>just as the house of Ahab prostituted itself.</b><br>The house of Ahab is synonymous with idolatry and wickedness in the biblical narrative. Ahab, along with his wife Jezebel, promoted the worship of Baal and Asherah, leading Israel into deep spiritual corruption. This comparison underscores the severity of Jehoram's actions, as he aligned himself with one of the most infamous dynasties in Israel's history. The influence of Ahab's house extended into Judah through Jehoram's marriage to Athaliah, Ahab's daughter, further entrenching idolatrous practices.<p><b>You have also killed your brothers, your father&#8217;s family,</b><br>Jehoram's murder of his brothers is a grave sin, violating the sanctity of family and the commandment against murder. This act was likely motivated by a desire to secure his throne, eliminating any potential rivals. Such fratricide was not uncommon in ancient Near Eastern royal politics, but it was particularly egregious for a king of Judah, who was expected to uphold justice and righteousness. This action reflects a heart hardened against God's ways, prioritizing power over familial loyalty and divine command.<p><b>who were better than you.</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jehoram's brothers were more righteous or capable than he was, suggesting that they might have been more suitable to lead Judah. The biblical narrative often highlights the moral and spiritual qualities of leaders, and this comparison serves to further condemn Jehoram's character and choices. It implies that Jehoram's reign was not only marked by idolatry and violence but also by a failure to live up to the standards set by his predecessors and family members.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah who followed the sinful ways of the kings of Israel, particularly the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_ahab.htm">House of Ahab</a></b><br>A notorious dynasty in Israel known for idolatry and leading the nation away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, led astray by Jehoram's idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram's_brothers.htm">Jehoram's Brothers</a></b><br>Members of the royal family who were unjustly killed by Jehoram, described as more righteous than he.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_elijah.htm">Prophet Elijah</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the one who delivered God's message of judgment to Jehoram.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Jehoram's reign demonstrates the destructive power of idolatry, leading not only to personal downfall but also to the corruption of an entire nation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_leadership.htm">The Influence of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on those they lead.

Jehoram&#8217;s insecurity silenced righteous voices that might have called him back to faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a> levels four charges against King Jehoram: copying Israel&#8217;s apostate kings, leading Judah into idolatry, embracing the corrupt model of Ahab&#8217;s house, and murdering his own brothers. Each charge reflects deliberate, informed rebellion against God&#8217;s revealed will. The verse explains why severe judgment follows in 21:14-20&#8212;Judah&#8217;s king had rejected covenant fidelity, corrupted his people, and spilled innocent blood. The lesson is timeless: leadership that turns from the LORD invites devastation, while obedience protects both leader and nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And hast made . . . to go a whoring</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, "caused to commit fornication" (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm" title="Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.">2Chronicles 21:11</a>).
