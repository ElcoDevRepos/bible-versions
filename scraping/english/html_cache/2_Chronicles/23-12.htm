Her reign was marked by idolatry and violence, including the massacre of the royal family to secure her power. The noise she heard was the result of a coup led by Jehoiada the priest, who was restoring the rightful heir, Joash, to the throne. This event signifies a turning point where the people of Judah, under the guidance of Jehoiada, rejected Athaliah's illegitimate rule. The cheering indicates the people's support for the Davidic line, which Athaliah had attempted to destroy. This moment is a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his descendants would continue to rule (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>she went out to them in the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. Athaliah's entrance into the temple area is significant because it was a place she had desecrated by promoting Baal worship. Her presence there during this pivotal moment highlights the contrast between her idolatrous reign and the restoration of true worship under Joash. The temple was also the setting for the anointing of kings, emphasizing the legitimacy of Joash's kingship. This event foreshadows the ultimate cleansing and restoration of worship that Jesus Christ would bring, as He is the true King and High Priest who purifies the temple of our hearts (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah was the queen mother of Judah who usurped the throne after the death of her son, King Ahaziah.

The &#8220;noise&#8221; she hears is the sudden eruption of covenant joy that breaks the long night of her tyranny. Scripture often marks decisive divine intervention with an unmistakable sound (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>).
