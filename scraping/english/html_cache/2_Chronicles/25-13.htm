However, a prophet advised him to dismiss these troops, as God was not with Israel. This decision reflects the importance of obedience to divine guidance over military might. The dismissal of these troops highlights the tension between Judah and Israel during this period, as the two kingdoms were often at odds despite their shared heritage.<p><b>raided the cities of Judah</b><br>The dismissed troops, feeling disgruntled and perhaps seeking compensation for their lost wages, turned against Judah. This act of raiding indicates the volatility and lack of unity among the tribes of Israel and Judah. It also underscores the consequences of disobedience and the potential for internal strife when God's instructions are not fully followed.<p><b>from Samaria to Beth-horon</b><br>Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, represents the starting point of the raid, indicating that the troops were likely from this region. Beth-horon, located in the territory of Benjamin, was a strategic location on the border between Israel and Judah. This geographical reference suggests the extent of the raid and the vulnerability of Judah's border towns. The route from Samaria to Beth-horon was historically significant for military campaigns, as seen in other biblical accounts.<p><b>They struck down 3,000 people</b><br>The loss of 3,000 lives is a significant blow to Judah, reflecting the severity of the raid. This number emphasizes the destructive impact of the troops' actions and serves as a reminder of the cost of disobedience and the consequences of failing to trust fully in God's provision and protection. The number 3,000 is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the number of Israelites who fell at the incident of the golden calf, highlighting moments of judgment and consequence.<p><b>and carried off a great deal of plunder</b><br>The taking of plunder was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving as both compensation for the soldiers and a means of weakening the enemy. This act of plundering not only inflicted economic damage on Judah but also symbolized the breach of trust and the breakdown of relations between the two kingdoms. The plunder taken by the troops can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral decay that occurs when God's people turn away from His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially hired mercenaries from Israel but later sent them back, leading to their anger and subsequent actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/troops_from_israel.htm">Troops from Israel</a></b><br>Mercenaries hired by Amaziah, who were dismissed and retaliated by raiding Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by Amaziah, and the region affected by the raids.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>A city in the northern kingdom of Israel, mentioned as a point of reference for the raids.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-horon.htm">Beth-horon</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Ephraim, part of the path of the raiding troops.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_guidance.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Guidance</a></b><br>Amaziah's decision to send back the troops was in obedience to a prophetic warning.

Though costly, his obedience shows the consistent biblical principle that trusting the LORD is better than relying on human strength, echoed in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>.<p>&#8226; The dismissed men felt insulted and enraged (25:10).
