The officers, likely referring to the leaders and officials of Judah, and the people together express a shared enthusiasm. This reflects a time of spiritual renewal under King Joash, who was influenced by the priest Jehoiada. The rejoicing indicates a heartfelt commitment to restoring the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. This communal joy can be compared to the joy seen in other biblical instances of temple restoration, such as in <a href="/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a> when the foundation of the second temple was laid.<p><b>and brought their contributions</b><br>The act of bringing contributions signifies the people's willingness to support the work of God financially. This was a freewill offering, demonstrating their dedication and gratitude. The contributions were likely in the form of money or valuable items, as was customary for temple repairs. This mirrors the contributions made for the construction of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>, where the Israelites gave generously from their possessions.<p><b>and they dropped them in the chest</b><br>The chest was a secure collection box placed at the temple to gather funds for its repair. This method ensured transparency and accountability in handling the contributions. The use of a chest for collecting offerings is a practical measure that underscores the importance of integrity in managing God's resources. This practice is reminiscent of the collection boxes used in the New Testament, such as the treasury in the temple where Jesus observed the widow's offering in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>.<p><b>until it was full</b><br>The phrase indicates the abundance of the contributions, showing the people's overwhelming generosity. The chest being filled signifies the success of the fundraising effort and the community's commitment to the temple's restoration. This abundance can be seen as a fulfillment of God's provision when His people are united in purpose, similar to the overflowing blessings described in <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>, where God promises to pour out blessings when His people bring the full tithe into the storehouse.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>- The king of Judah who initiated the restoration of the temple.
