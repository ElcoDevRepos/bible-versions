Ivory was a luxury material, often imported from distant lands, indicating extensive trade networks. The use of ivory for the throne signifies opulence and the king's ability to access rare resources. In biblical symbolism, ivory can represent purity and beauty. The throne's greatness reflects Solomon's wisdom and the prosperity of Israel during his reign, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>, which parallels this account.<p><b>and overlaid it with pure gold.</b><br>Gold, a symbol of divinity and kingship, was abundant during Solomon's time, as noted in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-17</a>. The overlaying of the throne with pure gold emphasizes the splendor and divine favor upon Solomon's kingdom. Gold's use in the temple and Solomon's palace (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>) further connects the throne to the sacred and royal authority. This imagery foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is often typified by Solomon in his wisdom and glory, yet surpasses him in eternal reign and divine nature, as seen in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Solomon was the son of King David and Bathsheba.

The parallel adds that "the top of the throne was round behind" (<a href="/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>). Comparing also the two accounts, it would appear that there were twelve lions on each side of the throne, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two to each step. When it is said that <span class="cmt_word">there were two lions standing by the stays</span> (or, <span class="accented">arms</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on each side of</span> the sitting-place, we may easily imagine, from ancient modelled thrones, that of them the arms were themselves "no small part." It is remarkable that the parallel does not take cognizance of the footstool. The lion is, of course, as natural a symbol as it is an old one of sovereign power and place; and the use of the lion and the number of them, reminding of the tribes of Israel, were specifically justified to the people, whose oracles contained such words as those in <a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>. Josephus tells us that a golden bull supported the seat of the throne. If so, it is remarkable that the statement should be omitted in both of our Old Testament narrations. The dimensions of the throne we might have looked for, but they are not given. That they were well proportioned to the height, marked by six steps, may be taken for granted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Additionally, the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
