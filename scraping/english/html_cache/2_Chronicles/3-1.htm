Solomon, the son of David, fulfills the divine promise made to David that his son would build a house for God's name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The "house of the LORD" refers to the Temple, which would become the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The construction of the Temple signifies a new era of worship, transitioning from the portable Tabernacle to a permanent structure.<p><b>in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah</b><br>Mount Moriah holds deep historical and spiritual significance. It is traditionally identified as the location where Abraham was willing to sacrifice Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>), demonstrating faith and obedience. This connection underscores the Temple's role as a place of sacrifice and worship. Jerusalem, the city chosen by God, becomes the political and spiritual center of Israel. The choice of Mount Moriah for the Temple's location highlights the continuity of God's plan and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>where the LORD had appeared to his father David</b><br>This appearance refers to the divine encounter David had when he purchased the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18-28</a>). The LORD's appearance to David at this site underscores its sanctity and divine selection as the Temple's location. It also reflects God's mercy, as the site was where the plague on Israel ceased after David's intercession. This divine encounter emphasizes the importance of obedience and repentance in the relationship between God and His people.<p><b>This was the place that David had prepared</b><br>David's preparation involved purchasing the threshing floor and gathering materials for the Temple's construction (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-5</a>). Although David was not permitted to build the Temple due to his history as a warrior (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>), his preparations laid the groundwork for Solomon's task. This preparation reflects David's devotion and desire to honor God, as well as the continuity of leadership and vision from David to Solomon.<p><b>on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite</b><br>The threshing floor of Ornan, a Jebusite, was a significant site due to its association with David's repentance and God's mercy (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18-28</a>). The purchase of this site by David transformed it from a place of judgment to one of worship and reconciliation. The Jebusites were the original inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the acquisition of this land signifies the transition of the city into the hands of the Israelites, further establishing Jerusalem as the center of Israelite worship and governance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the first temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple that Solomon built, which became the central place of worship for the Israelites and housed the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, chosen by God as the place where His name would dwell.

This name <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> occurs twice in the Old Testament, viz. here and <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>, in which latter reference it is alluded to as "the <span class="accented">land</span> of Moriah," and "one of the mountains" in it is spoken cf. Whether the name designates the same place in each instance is more than doubtful. In the present passage the connection of the place with David is marked. Had it been the spot connected with Abraham and the proposed sacrifice of Isaac, it is at least probable that this also would have been emphasized, and not here only, but in <a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17-25</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16-26</a>; but in neither of these places is there the remotest suggestion of such fame of old belonging to it. Nor in later passages of history (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nehemiah's rebuilding, and in the prophets, and the New Testament), where the opportunities would have been of the most tempting, is there found one single suggestion of the kind. There am also at fewest two reasons of a positive and intriusic character against Solomon's Moriah being Abraham's - in that this latter was a specially conspicuous height (<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>), and was a secluded and comparatively desolate place, neither of which features attach to Solomon's Moriah. Nevertheless the identity theory is stoutly maintained by names as good as those of Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 475); Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 152); Hengstenberg ('Genuineness of Pentateuch, 2:162, Ryland's tr.); Kurtz ('History of O. C.,' 1:271); and Knobel and Kalisch under the passage in Genesis - against Grove (in Dr. Smith's ' Bible Dictionary'); Stanley (' Sinai and Palestine,' p. 251;'Jewish Church,' 1. 49); De Wette, Bleek, and Tischendorf [see 'Speaker's Commentary,' under <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>]. Though there is some uncertainty as to the more exact form of the derivation of the name Moriah, it seems most probable that the meaning of it may be "the sight of Jehovah." Where <span class="cmt_word">the Lord appeared unto David his father.</span> The clause is no doubt elliptical, and probably it is not to be mended by the inserting of the words," the Lord," as in our Authorized Version. We do not read anywhere that the Lord did then and there appear to David, though we do read that "the angel of the Lord" appeared to him (<a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15, 19</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Nor is it desirable to force the niph. preterite of the verb here, rightly rendered "appeared" or "was seen," into "was shown." We should prefer to solve the difficulty occasioned by the somewhat unfinished shape of the clause (or clauses) by reading it in close relation to <a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>. Then the vivid impressions that had been made both by works and words of the angel of the Lord caused David to feel and to say with emphasis, "This is the (destined) house of the Lord God," etc. In this light our present passage would read, in a parenthetic manner, "which (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house, its Moriah position and all) was seen of David;" or with somewhat more of ease, "as was seen of David;" and the following "in the place," etc., will read in a breath with the preceding "began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem... in the place," etc. <span class="cmt_word">David had prepared</span> (so <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the threshing-floor of Ornan</span> (so <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>;
