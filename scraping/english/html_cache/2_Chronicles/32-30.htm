The Spring of Gihon was a crucial water source for Jerusalem, located in the Kidron Valley. By blocking the upper outlet, Hezekiah aimed to secure the city's water supply against the Assyrian siege led by Sennacherib. This action reflects Hezekiah's wisdom and foresight in protecting his people. The Gihon Spring is also historically significant as the site where Solomon was anointed king (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33-45</a>), symbolizing a place of divine blessing and provision.<p><b>and channeled it down to the west side of the City of David.</b><br>Hezekiah's construction of a tunnel to redirect the waters of the Gihon Spring to the west side of the City of David is a remarkable feat of ancient engineering. This tunnel, known as Hezekiah's Tunnel, is approximately 1,750 feet long and was carved through solid rock. It ensured a continuous water supply within the city walls, crucial during times of siege. Archaeological discoveries, including the Siloam Inscription, confirm the historical accuracy of this biblical account. The City of David, the original nucleus of Jerusalem, holds deep historical and spiritual significance as the site of King David's reign and the location of the Ark of the Covenant.<p><b>And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.</b><br>Hezekiah's prosperity is attributed to his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in Judah. His reign is marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh, the removal of idolatrous practices, and the celebration of the Passover (2 Chronicles 30). The prosperity he experienced is seen as a divine blessing for his obedience and trust in God. This phrase echoes the biblical principle that those who follow God's commandments and seek His guidance will find success and favor (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). Hezekiah's life serves as a type of Christ, exemplifying a righteous king who leads his people in faithfulness to God, prefiguring the ultimate reign of Jesus as the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship.
