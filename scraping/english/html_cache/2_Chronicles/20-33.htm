These locations were originally used for the worship of Yahweh but became associated with idolatry and pagan practices over time. Despite King Jehoshaphat's reforms and efforts to bring the nation back to the worship of the true God, these high places remained. This indicates a partial obedience to God's commands, as complete removal of these sites was necessary for full devotion. The persistence of high places is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, highlighting the struggle between true worship and syncretism. This phrase underscores the incomplete nature of religious reform during Jehoshaphat's reign, as seen in other passages like <a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>.<p><b>the people had not yet set their hearts</b><br>This phrase suggests a lack of full commitment or dedication among the people of Judah. Setting one's heart implies a deliberate and wholehearted decision to follow God. The people's failure to do so reflects a spiritual condition that is not fully aligned with God's will. This is a common issue throughout the Old Testament, where external reforms are not always matched by internal transformation. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of will and emotion, and its alignment with God is crucial for true worship and obedience. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which calls for loving God with all one's heart.<p><b>on the God of their fathers.</b><br>The phrase "God of their fathers" refers to the covenantal relationship established between God and the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This covenant is foundational to Israel's identity and history. By not setting their hearts on the God of their fathers, the people of Judah were neglecting their spiritual heritage and the promises associated with it. This neglect often led to idolatry and moral decline, as seen throughout the books of Kings and Chronicles. The call to return to the God of their fathers is a recurring prophetic theme, urging the people to remember and uphold the covenant. This is seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10</a>, which warns against forsaking the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his efforts to follow God and reform the nation, yet he did not remove the high places.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites often used for idol worship, which were not removed during Jehoshaphat's reign, indicating incomplete religious reform.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoshaphat reigned and sought to lead the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_their_fathers.htm">The God of their fathers</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whom the people of Judah were called to worship wholeheartedly.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the kingdom who struggled with fully committing their hearts to God, as evidenced by their continued use of high places.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/incomplete_obedience.htm">Incomplete Obedience</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's failure to remove the high places serves as a reminder that partial obedience to God is not enough.

The LORD had commanded, &#8220;You must destroy all the high places&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;3</a>), reserving worship for the temple in Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; Even kings who loved the LORD often tolerated these sites. For example, &#8220;The high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on them&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>). That pattern sets the stage for the statement here in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>however</b><p>&#8226; The word signals a sharp contrast. Just one verse earlier we read of Jehoshaphat, &#8220;He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not stray from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-32.htm">2 Chronicles 20:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet spiritual compromise can coexist with outward faithfulness. The &#8220;however&#8221; reminds us of Jehoshaphat&#8217;s earlier reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3&#8211;6</a>) but points to what still needed addressing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were not removed</b><p>&#8226; Incomplete obedience leaves footholds for future sin. King Asa &#8220;did not remove the high places from Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>), and Joash later did the same (<a href="/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Tolerating even a little idolatry keeps the door open for larger departures from God. <a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> warns that unremoved high places provoke divine judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people had not yet set their hearts</b><p>&#8226; Genuine reform must move from externals to the inner life. Samuel urged Israel, &#8220;Direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him only&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Heart devotion precedes lasting change: &#8220;The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts &#8230; so that you may love Him with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>). A divided heart is &#8220;faithless&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>), and Jesus echoed this truth: &#8220;This people honors Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the God of their fathers</b><p>&#8226; The phrase anchors Judah&#8217;s calling in the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Returning to &#8220;the God of their fathers&#8221; means embracing the faith once delivered: &#8220;Return now to the LORD, the God of your fathers&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Malachi later appealed to the same heritage: &#8220;Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>). Covenant history is meant to inspire present faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jehoshaphat&#8217;s legacy was admirable, yet this verse highlights unfinished work. High places lingered because the people&#8217;s hearts remained only partly God-directed. Outward reforms, unaccompanied by wholehearted devotion, never fully eradicate idolatry. True faith removes every rival altar and sets the heart firmly on the God who has been faithful to generations past and remains so today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">For . . . hearts.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the people had not yet directed their heart.</span> This language is the chronicler's own (see <a href="/2_chronicles/12-14.htm" title="And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.">2Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm" title="Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have taken away the groves out of the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.">2Chronicles 19:3</a>), and is substituted for the statement, "The people were still wont to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places" (Kings).
