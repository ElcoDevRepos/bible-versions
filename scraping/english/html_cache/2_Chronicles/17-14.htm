The division by "houses of their fathers" reflects the patriarchal structure of Israelite society, where lineage and heritage were crucial for identity and inheritance. This method of organization ensured that each tribe maintained its distinct identity and responsibilities within the nation.<p><b>From Judah, the commanders of thousands:</b><br>Judah, being the largest and most prominent tribe, often took a leading role in military and political matters. The "commanders of thousands" suggests a well-structured military hierarchy, with leaders responsible for large groups of soldiers. This structure is reminiscent of the organization seen during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>), where leaders were appointed over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.<p><b>Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor;</b><br>Adnah is noted as a significant military leader, and his name means "pleasure" or "delight." The mention of "300,000 mighty men of valor" highlights the strength and preparedness of Judah's forces. The term "mighty men of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe warriors of exceptional bravery and skill (e.g., David's mighty men in <a href="/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>). This large number indicates a period of military strength and stability under King Jehoshaphat's reign, reflecting God's blessing and the fulfillment of His promises to protect and prosper His people when they followed His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his reforms and efforts to strengthen the kingdom spiritually and militarily.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/adnah.htm">Adnah</a></b><br>A military commander in Judah, leading a significant force of 300,000 mighty men of valor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men_of_valor.htm">Mighty Men of Valor</a></b><br>A term used to describe the elite warriors in the army, known for their bravery and skill in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/military_organization.htm">Military Organization</a></b><br>The structuring of the army into divisions and the appointment of commanders, reflecting a well-organized and prepared military force.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_preparedness.htm">Spiritual Preparedness</a></b><br>Just as Jehoshaphat organized and prepared his army, Christians are called to be spiritually prepared, putting on the full armor of God to stand firm against spiritual battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Adnah's role as a commander highlights the importance of leadership and responsibility.

Here, the list underscores the solid, measurable strength He granted to King Jehoshaphat&#8217;s kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the houses of their fathers</b><p>&#8226; The census is arranged by family lines, echoing the tribal structure instituted in <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a> and reaffirmed in <a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>.<p>&#8226; Lineage conveyed identity, inheritance, and responsibility. By highlighting &#8220;houses,&#8221; the writer shows that both spiritual heritage and civic duty flowed through families (see <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This organization fostered unity; each clan could see its contribution to Judah&#8217;s defense, much like <a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-14</a> later rallies families to build the wall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Judah</b><p>&#8226; Judah, the royal tribe (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>), supplied the first contingent.<p>&#8226; After the kingdom divided, Judah carried David&#8217;s covenant promise (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Naming Judah first affirms that God&#8217;s redemptive line remained intact despite national upheaval (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The emphasis also reminds us that spiritual leadership should be matched by practical readiness (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the commanders of thousands</b><p>&#8226; Military structure mirrors Moses&#8217; system of leaders over &#8220;thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Such order prevents chaos and models the principle that God values disciplined stewardship of gifts and people (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; In practical terms, it assures that every soldier had clear oversight&#8212;critical for the victories recorded later in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15-22</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Adnah the commander</b><p>&#8226; Though little else is said of Adnah, his placement at the top of Judah&#8217;s roster implies proven faithfulness, similar to the mighty men surrounding David in <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>.<p>&#8226; God often elevates the faithful obscure (consider <a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-12</a> with David). Adnah&#8217;s mention tells us that God notices and records steadfast service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Mighty men of valor&#8221; is the same phrase used of Gideon&#8217;s troops (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>) and David&#8217;s warriors (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-28.htm">1 Chronicles 12:28</a>); it blends courage with skill.<p>&#8226; Three hundred thousand is no idle statistic&#8212;it represents God&#8217;s abundant provision for national security (compare Asa&#8217;s 300,000 from Judah in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The huge force also contrasts with later prophets&#8217; warnings against relying solely on armies (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), reminding readers that strength is a gift to be stewarded under God&#8217;s authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14</a> records a precise, clan-based muster of Judah&#8217;s troops under Adnah, totaling 300,000 seasoned warriors. The verse highlights God&#8217;s orderly provision for His people, the enduring significance of family heritage, the central role of Judah in redemptive history, and the worth He places on faithful leadership. Ultimately it assures us that the Lord equips those who walk in His ways with everything needed&#8212;spiritually and practically&#8212;to fulfill their calling.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And these . . . their fathers.</span>--<span class= "ital">And</span> <span class= "ital">this is their muster</span> (or census), <span class= "ital">according to their father-houses </span>(<span class= "ital">clans</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm" title="And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.">1Chronicles 24:3</a>.
