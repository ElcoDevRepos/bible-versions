Humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with God's favor (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>). Amon's lack of humility is significant because it demonstrates a willful rejection of God's authority, which is a central issue in the narrative of the kings of Judah and Israel.<p><b>as his father Manasseh had done</b><br>Manasseh, Amon's father, is known for his initial idolatry and evil practices, but he eventually repented and humbled himself before God (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>). This repentance led to his restoration and a return to the worship of Yahweh. The mention of Manasseh serves as a reminder of God's mercy and willingness to forgive those who turn back to Him, regardless of their past sins. It also underscores the importance of personal choice in spiritual matters, as Amon had the example of his father's repentance but chose a different path.<p><b>instead, Amon increased his guilt</b><br>Amon's actions are described as increasing his guilt, indicating a deliberate continuation and escalation of sinful behavior. This phrase suggests a conscious decision to persist in wrongdoing, which is a theme seen throughout the Bible where individuals or nations face consequences for their unrepentant sin (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-32</a>). Amon's reign was marked by idolatry and a return to the practices that Manasseh had abandoned after his repentance. This increase in guilt can be seen as a rejection of the opportunity for redemption and a deeper entrenchment in sin, leading to his eventual downfall and assassination (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-24.htm">2 Chronicles 33:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>The son of Manasseh and king of Judah who reigned for two years.
