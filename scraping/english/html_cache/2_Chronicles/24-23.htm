The Arameans were often in conflict with Israel and Judah. Joash, the king of Judah, had turned away from God, leading to divine judgment through foreign invasion. This reflects the covenantal theme where disobedience leads to consequences, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>They entered Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>The invasion of Judah and its capital, Jerusalem, signifies a direct threat to the heart of the nation. Jerusalem was not only the political center but also the spiritual center, housing the Temple. This invasion underscores the severity of the situation and the vulnerability of Judah due to its spiritual decline.<p><b>and destroyed all the leaders of the people</b><br>The leaders, or princes, were likely those who had led the nation into idolatry and away from the worship of Yahweh. Their destruction can be seen as a form of divine retribution. This act also left the nation without its leadership, further destabilizing Judah.<p><b>and they sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus</b><br>Damascus was the capital of Aram, and sending the plunder there signifies the complete victory of the Arameans over Judah. The loss of wealth and resources would have been a significant blow to Judah, both economically and symbolically.

(See for the phrase, <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm" title="And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.">Exodus 34:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The host of Syria came up against him.</span>--Comp. <a href="/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:17</a>. Our passage seems to show that a small part (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-24.htm" title="For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.">2Chronicles 24:24</a>) of the besieging army was detached, and sent against Jerusalem. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm" title="And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.">2Kings 18:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm" title="And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.">2Kings 18:17</a>.) The princes of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them.">2Chronicles 24:17</a>) at the head of a large force met the invaders in the field; but the Syrians routed them, and "destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people." We may suppose that they made it their special aim to cut off the leaders of the Jewish host. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/18-30.htm" title="Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.">2Chronicles 18:30</a>.) Thus the apostate princes were overtaken by the prophetic doom. (LXX., "the princes of the people among the people; <span class= "ital">"</span>Syriac and Vulg. and Arabic omit "from among the people." But comp. <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the end of the year</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>; margin, both of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, <span class="accented">revolution.</span> The word is found three other times, <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>. The versions, of course, express correctly what is meant, but probably the season of spring is also conveyed (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">host of Syria</span>. Their king was Hazael (<a href="/2_kings/12-17.htm">2 Kings 12:17</a>), whether actually with them is perhaps not certain, but the last clause in the verse just quoted would seem to convey that impression. He was King of <span class="accented">Damascus</span> (Aram, or Syria), and having already temporarily mastered Israel (<a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3, 4, 22</a>), the way was paved to Gath (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>), whence wistful eyes were bent on Jerusalem, nearly thirty miles distant thence. <span class="cmt_word">Destroyed all the princes of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">And sent all the spoil</span>. Whether intended so here or not, probably the strict subject of the verb in this clause is Joash and his counsellors (ver. 18 in parallel), in their fright - and just fright - helpless after the slaughter chronicled in our following verse, bribing off Hazael and his host, as in parallel. The suggestion is most plausible that tidings of Zechariah's martyrdom and of the occasion of it were the very incentive to Hazael's incursion, and an illustration of the "means" by which God works, and by which he wrought his purpose in this instance. <span class="cmt_word">The spoil of them</span>. If this means only the spoil of the defeated army strictly, then our text gives no trace of the contents of ver. 18 in parallel just alluded to; but the frequent dislocation incident to copied extracts and matter borrowed from original sources, and so often evidenced in the present history, when we have been comparing the two derived accounts to which we are indebted for it, incline us to the above view, as one quite open at any rate to possibility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the turn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7791;&#183;q&#363;&#183;p&#772;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
