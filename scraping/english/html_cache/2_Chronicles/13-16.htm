The context is the reign of King Abijah of Judah, who faced King Jeroboam of Israel. Historically, this conflict is part of the larger division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. The Israelites fleeing indicates a turning point in the battle, suggesting a loss of morale and divine favor. This event underscores the theme of divine intervention, where God supports the Davidic line, represented by Judah, in accordance with His covenant promises.<p><b>and God delivered them into their hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine intervention in the battle's outcome. The concept of God delivering enemies into the hands of His chosen people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in battles such as those led by Joshua and David. It reflects the belief that military success is ultimately determined by God's will rather than human strength or strategy. This event can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and preserve the line of David, which is significant in the broader biblical narrative leading to the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this battle, who

&#8220;So&#8221; acts like a hinge, swinging the reader from Abijah&#8217;s impassioned appeal (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-10.htm">2 Chronicles 13:10-12</a>) and Judah&#8217;s cry to the LORD (v. 14) to the outcome that immediately follows.<p>&#8226; It signals consequence&#8212;God is responding, just as He promised in passages such as <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;So&#8221; reminds us that divine intervention is never random; it flows out of covenant faithfulness and human response (see <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Israelites</b><p>Here the term points specifically to the northern kingdom under Jeroboam, not the united nation.<p>&#8226; They had set up golden calves and alternate shrines (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), abandoning the temple worship God required (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Their identity had become one of self-willed religion, contrasting sharply with Judah&#8217;s continued (though imperfect) temple-centered worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-10.htm">2 Chronicles 13:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fled</b><p>Flight signals undeniable defeat.<p>&#8226; God had warned that disobedience would make His people &#8220;flee before their enemies&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier reversals&#8212;like Israel&#8217;s rout at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>)&#8212;illustrate how sin drains courage, while dependence on the LORD emboldens (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The northern armies, vast in number (800,000; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>), found numbers meaningless without God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before Judah</b><p>Judah, though smaller (400,000 troops), stood in covenant alignment.<p>&#8226; Abijah&#8217;s speech highlighted their faithfulness: priests from Aaron&#8217;s line, daily offerings, and the golden lampstand still in place (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear when righteous King Asa faced the Cushites&#8212;&#8220;the LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-12.htm">2 Chronicles 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that victory belongs to those who stand &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>), not merely before human foes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And God</b><p>The verse pivots to the real protagonist.<p>&#8226; Scripture continually stresses God&#8217;s active role: &#8220;The battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; He hears the shout of faith (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-15.htm">2 Chronicles 13:15</a>) and moves decisively, just as He did for Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Human strength is secondary; divine sovereignty is primary (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Delivered them</b><p>&#8220;Delivered&#8221; speaks of handing over an enemy, reversing what could have seemed inevitable.<p>&#8226; The same verb surfaces when God &#8220;delivered Midian into your hand&#8221; for Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It conveys purposeful judgment, fulfilling the warning of <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> that rebellion would lead to defeat.<p>&#8226; Deliverance here is not random good fortune but God&#8217;s moral governance in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into their hands</b><p>The transfer is total.<p>&#8226; Judah doesn&#8217;t merely survive; it gains decisive control, pictured in the heavy casualty count that follows (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-17.htm">2 Chronicles 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language marks other covenant victories&#8212;Joshua acknowledged, &#8220;The LORD has delivered them into our hands&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Such outcomes reinforce faith: if God grants the enemy into our hands, we can rest in His ongoing protection (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/13-16.htm">2 Chronicles 13:16</a> captures a single, swift moment when the northern armies crumble and Judah prevails. The flight of Israel highlights the impotence of self-made religion; Judah&#8217;s triumph exalts covenant faithfulness. Most crucially, God Himself engineers the outcome&#8212;He hears, He acts, He delivers. Numbers, tactics, and human courage fade into the background while divine sovereignty and covenant loyalty stand center stage. The verse reminds every generation that aligning with God and His revealed worship invites His powerful, protective hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;n&#363;&#183;s&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
