Jerusalem, known as the City of David, holds significant historical and theological importance. It was the site where Abraham was willing to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22) and later became the political and spiritual center of Israel under King David. The choice of Jerusalem is a fulfillment of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>, where God promised to choose a place for His Name to dwell. This decision underscores the city's role as the focal point of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, which Solomon built. Jerusalem's selection also foreshadows its future significance in biblical prophecy, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the New Jerusalem descends from heaven.<p><b>and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's covenant with David, establishing his lineage as the ruling dynasty over Israel. The Davidic Covenant, found in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promises that David's descendants would rule Israel forever, ultimately pointing to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). David's selection as king was not based on human criteria but on God's sovereign will, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearance. David's reign is characterized by a deep commitment to God, despite his personal failings, and serves as a type of Christ, who would be the perfect and eternal King. This choice also highlights the unity of the tribes of Israel under a divinely appointed leader, reflecting God's desire for His people to be governed according to His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God as the place for His Name to dwell.
