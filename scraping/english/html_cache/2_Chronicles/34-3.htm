By the eighth year of his reign, he would have been sixteen years old. This period marks a significant turning point in his life, as he begins to take personal responsibility for his spiritual journey and leadership. The number eight in biblical numerology often symbolizes new beginnings, which aligns with Josiah's spiritual awakening and reformative actions.<p><b>while he was still young</b><br>Josiah's youth is emphasized to highlight his early commitment to God, which is notable given the idolatrous environment he inherited. His young age suggests a purity of heart and openness to divine influence, reminiscent of other young biblical figures like Samuel and David, who also sought God earnestly from a young age.<p><b>Josiah began to seek the God of his father David</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate and personal pursuit of a relationship with God, modeled after King David, who is often seen as the ideal king due to his heart for God. Josiah's seeking is a return to the covenantal faithfulness that David exemplified, contrasting with the idolatry of his immediate predecessors. This pursuit aligns with the Deuteronomic ideal of seeking God with all one's heart and soul (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>).<p><b>and in the twelfth year</b><br>By the twelfth year of his reign, Josiah would have been twenty years old. This marks a period of maturity and readiness to implement significant religious reforms. The twelfth year is significant as it represents a time of governmental stability and personal conviction, allowing Josiah to act decisively.<p><b>he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem</b><br>Josiah's reforms began with a cleansing, indicating a removal of impurities and a return to holiness. Judah and Jerusalem, as the heart of the nation, were the focal points of this purification process. This cleansing was both physical and spiritual, aiming to restore the worship of Yahweh as prescribed in the Law of Moses.<p><b>of the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images</b><br>The high places were local worship sites often associated with idolatry and syncretism. Asherah poles were wooden symbols of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, representing fertility and often linked to Baal worship. Carved idols and cast images were physical representations of false gods, directly violating the commandments against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>). Josiah's actions were a fulfillment of the prophetic call to destroy idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>) and a type of Christ's cleansing of the temple, emphasizing the need for pure worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The young king of Judah who began his reign at the age of eight.

We cannot mistake the allusion in this verse to his <span class="accented">personal</span> religion at, say, sixteen years of age, as the foundation of his religious reign and of the practical devotion to reformation, instanced as commencing with his twentieth year. It may be here noted that the Prophet Jeremiah was called to his work in the year following thereupon, or, perhaps, the very same year (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1, 2</a>). It is highly likely that Josiah and Jeremiah were given to one another providentially, to cooperate in all good works, now so needed for Church and state. The three dates of the <span class="accented">eighth, twelfth</span>, and (ver. 8) the <span class="accented">eighteenth</span> year of Josiah's reign wore dates memorable in his life.
