The men of Judah, led by King Jehoshaphat, had been facing a formidable coalition of enemies. The wilderness mentioned here is likely the Desert of Tekoa, a region south of Jerusalem. This geographical location is significant as it was a strategic vantage point, allowing the men of Judah to survey the battlefield. The wilderness often symbolizes desolation and testing in the Bible, reminiscent of Israel's wanderings and Jesus' temptation.<p><b>they looked for the vast army</b><br>The vast army refers to the coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites that had come against Judah. This coalition posed a significant threat due to its size and the combined strength of these nations. The anticipation of seeing such a formidable force would have been daunting for the men of Judah. This moment highlights the human tendency to assess situations based on visible circumstances, often leading to fear and doubt.<p><b>but there were only corpses lying on the ground</b><br>This phrase reveals the miraculous intervention of God. Prior to this, Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah had sought the Lord through prayer and fasting, and God had promised deliverance without the need for battle. The sight of the corpses signifies the fulfillment of God's promise and His power to fight on behalf of His people. This event echoes other instances in Scripture where God delivers His people in unexpected ways, such as the defeat of the Assyrian army in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>.<p><b>no one had escaped</b><br>The complete destruction of the enemy forces underscores the totality of God's deliverance. It emphasizes that when God acts, His victory is absolute. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the fate of those who oppose God's people, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine justice. The thoroughness of this victory prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over sin and death, where no enemy will escape His judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led his people in seeking the Lord's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, whose people were under threat from a coalition of enemy nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The location where the men of Judah found the defeated enemy army, symbolizing a place of testing and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vast_army.htm">The Vast Army</a></b><br>Refers to the coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites who came to attack Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>The miraculous event where God caused confusion among the enemy forces, leading to their self-destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's reliance on God demonstrates the importance of trusting in God's power and plan, even when circumstances seem overwhelming.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer_and_worship.htm">The Power of Prayer and Worship</a></b><br>Judah's victory was preceded by prayer and worship, highlighting the importance of seeking God and praising Him in the midst of trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The miraculous defeat of Judah's enemies serves as a reminder that God is capable of delivering us from any situation, often in ways we cannot foresee.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to choose faith over fear, knowing that God is in control and will fight on our behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_god's_glory.htm">Witnessing God's Glory</a></b><br>The aftermath of the battle allowed Judah to witness God's glory and power, encouraging us to look for God's hand in our lives and testify to His greatness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_20_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 20:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_24_God_s_faith_in_battles.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:24 demonstrate God's faithfulness in battles we face?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_trusting_God_in_2_Chron_20_24.htm">What can we learn about trusting God from 2 Chronicles 20:24?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_Romans_8_31_s_protection.htm">How does this verse connect with Romans 8:31 on God's protection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_2_Chronicles_20_24_today.htm">How can we apply the victory in 2 Chronicles 20:24 to our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_aid_in_God_s_deliverance.htm">What role does faith play in witnessing God's deliverance as seen here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_24_God_s_role_in_battles.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:24 demonstrate God's intervention in battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_2_Chronicles_20_24_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 2 Chronicles 20:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_20_24_shows_God_s_faithfulness.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:24 reflect God's faithfulness to His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_outside_bible_for_2_chron_20.htm">Is there archaeological or historical evidence outside the Bible to corroborate this alleged miraculous victory (2 Chronicles 20)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_necho's_rule_align_with_egypt.htm">How can the historical timeline of Pharaoh Necho taking control of Judah (2 Chronicles 36:2-4) align with secular Egyptian records?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/judah's_fighting_men__500k_or_470k.htm">How many fighting men were found in Judah?

Compare Israel stepping toward the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-16</a>) and Jonathan climbing toward the Philistine outpost (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God often brings His people to a vantage point where His work can be clearly seen, ensuring He receives the glory (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They looked for the vast army</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;vast army&#8221; had genuinely threatened Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>); their concern was not imagined.<p>&#8226; Looking out, they expected to engage in combat, mirroring Gideon&#8217;s anticipation before the Midianites (<a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith does not ignore reality; it faces the facts while resting in God&#8217;s prior promise (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there were only corpses lying on the ground</b><p>&#8226; The LORD had already acted: &#8220;The LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir&#8230; and they destroyed one another&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar sudden deliverances appear when the angel of the LORD struck the Assyrian camp (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>) and when Pharaoh&#8217;s army drowned (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The sight underscores that the battle truly belongs to the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).
