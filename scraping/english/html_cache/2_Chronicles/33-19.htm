Manasseh, known for his idolatry and evil practices, turned to God in genuine repentance. His prayer signifies a turning point, demonstrating that God is merciful and willing to forgive even the gravest sins when approached with a contrite heart. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's readiness to forgive, as seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>. The reception of his plea by God underscores the importance of humility and repentance in restoring one's relationship with God.<p><b>as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness</b><br>Manasseh's reign was marked by significant sin and apostasy, including idol worship and the shedding of innocent blood (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). His actions led Judah into spiritual decline, violating the covenant relationship with God. This phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the impact of leadership on a nation's spiritual health. It also reflects the biblical principle that sin has consequences, but repentance can lead to restoration.<p><b>and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols</b><br>The high places and Asherah poles were central to Canaanite worship and were strictly forbidden in Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). Manasseh's establishment of these sites indicates a deep-seated rebellion against God's commandments. Archaeological findings have uncovered similar sites, providing historical context to the biblical narrative. This phrase highlights the struggle between the worship of Yahweh and the pervasive influence of surrounding pagan cultures.<p><b>before he humbled himself</b><br>Humility is a key theme in Scripture, often associated with repentance and restoration (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). Manasseh's eventual humility before God marks a significant shift from his previous pride and rebellion. This transformation illustrates the biblical truth that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. It serves as an example of how true humility can lead to divine forgiveness and a renewed relationship with God.<p><b>they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers</b><br>The mention of the "Records of the Seers" suggests that there were additional historical documents or prophetic writings that chronicled the events of Manasseh's reign. This indicates the importance of recording and remembering both the failures and redemptions of leaders. It also points to the broader biblical practice of documenting God's dealings with His people, as seen in other historical books of the Bible. This phrase underscores the reliability and thoroughness of biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry but later repented and turned back to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who hears prayers and responds to genuine repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Sites where Manasseh initially set up altars for idol worship, contrary to God's commands.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles_and_idols.htm">Asherah Poles and Idols</a></b><br>Objects of pagan worship that Manasseh erected, symbolizing his unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/records_of_the_seers.htm">Records of the Seers</a></b><br>Historical accounts that document Manasseh's actions and his eventual repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>Manasseh's account demonstrates that no one is beyond the reach of God's grace.

Verse 13 already states, &#8220;He heard his petition and brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s response demonstrates His mercy promised in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> and <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>.<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s restoration was concrete&#8212;he didn&#8217;t merely feel forgiven; he was physically returned to his throne, reminding us of <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a> where the father runs to embrace the prodigal.<p>&#8226; By recording the divine answer, the text assures readers that God keeps His word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>) and that repentance is met with real pardon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All his sin and unfaithfulness</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness&#8230;&#8221; (33:19c). The chronicler refuses to whitewash Manasseh&#8217;s past (cf. <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Sins listed earlier: idolatry, child sacrifice, sorcery, and shedding innocent blood (33:6; <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Unfaithfulness&#8221; highlights covenant betrayal&#8212;he led Judah astray (33:9), breaking the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By pairing sin with prayer in the same record, Scripture illustrates <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>&#8212;where sin increased, grace abounded even more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols&#8230;&#8221; (33:19d).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3-5</a> catalogues these locations: the high places his father Hezekiah had torn down, altars in Jerusalem&#8217;s two courts, and every hill and tree.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a> commands the destruction of such sites; Manasseh did the opposite, inviting judgment (<a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying &#8220;sites,&#8221; the verse underlines that idolatry is not abstract; it infiltrates real spaces&#8212;homes, cities, hearts&#8212;until expelled (33:15-16).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before he humbled himself</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;before he humbled himself&#8230;&#8221; (33:19e). Humility is the hinge on which the narrative turns (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-26.htm">2 Chronicles 32:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God had allowed Assyria to capture him &#8220;with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles&#8221; (33:11); that suffering produced the humility <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> commends.<p>&#8226; Only after abandonment of pride could restoration come, mirroring <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;Humble yourselves&#8230;that He may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The order&#8212;sin first, humility later&#8212;warns that unrepentant pride delays God&#8217;s blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are indeed written in the Records of the Seers</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers.&#8221; (33:19f).<p>&#8226; Like references in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a> or <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>, this citation points to trustworthy historical documents kept by God&#8217;s prophets.<p>&#8226; It reassures readers that the biblical account is not folklore but anchored in corroborated history (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit-inspired selection we have is sufficient for faith (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>), yet these lost annals once bore witness that every detail really happened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-19.htm">2 Chronicles 33:19</a> gathers the whole arc of Manasseh&#8217;s story in one sentence: a desperate prayer, God&#8217;s gracious answer, the king&#8217;s horrifying sins, the tangible places of rebellion, the crucial moment of humility, and an outside record confirming it all. The verse proclaims both the depth of human depravity and the greater depth of divine mercy. Even the most notorious idol-builder can become a restored worshiper when he humbles himself and seeks the LORD, and Scripture records it so we will believe the same mercy is available today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">His prayer also</span> <span class= "bld">. . . of</span> <span class= "bld">him.</span>--<span class= "ital">And his prayer, and the hearing him.</span> Literally, <span class= "ital">and the being propitious to him</span> (the same verb as in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-13.htm" title="And prayed to him: and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
