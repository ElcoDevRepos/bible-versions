The peace mentioned here follows a significant military victory over a coalition of enemies, including the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites, which was achieved through divine intervention rather than military might. This peace is a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and bless those who are faithful to Him. The peace in Jehoshaphat's kingdom can be seen as a type of the ultimate peace that Christ brings to believers, as He is referred to as the "Prince of Peace" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p><b>for his God had given him rest</b><br>The phrase "his God" emphasizes the personal relationship between Jehoshaphat and Yahweh, highlighting the covenantal faithfulness of God to those who seek Him. The rest given by God is reminiscent of the rest promised to the Israelites in the Promised Land, as seen in <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>. This rest is not merely the absence of war but a deeper, spiritual rest that comes from trusting in God's sovereignty and provision. It foreshadows the spiritual rest offered through Jesus Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus invites those who are weary to find rest in Him.<p><b>on every side</b><br>The phrase "on every side" indicates comprehensive peace and security, suggesting that all potential threats were neutralized by divine intervention. This mirrors the peace and security promised to Israel when they are obedient to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. It also points to the eschatological peace that will be established in the new heavens and new earth, where there will be no more conflict or fear, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>. This complete peace is a foretaste of the ultimate reconciliation and harmony that will be realized in God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.
