It reflects the Assyrian practice of boasting about their military conquests and instilling fear in their enemies. Historically, Assyria was known for its powerful army and brutal tactics, which included deporting conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. The reference to "my fathers" highlights the continuity of Assyrian dominance, as previous kings had also expanded the empire's territory. This statement is intended to intimidate the people of Judah by reminding them of Assyria's past victories over other nations.<p><b>Have the gods of these nations ever been able to deliver their land from my hand?</b><br>Sennacherib's rhetorical question challenges the power of the gods worshiped by the nations he has conquered. In the ancient Near East, military success was often seen as a reflection of a nation's gods' power. By claiming that no other gods have been able to save their lands, Sennacherib is asserting the superiority of Assyria and its gods. This statement sets the stage for a theological confrontation, as it questions the ability of the God of Israel to protect Judah. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith for the people of Judah, as they are called to trust in the Lord despite the overwhelming threat. This challenge is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where the power of God is demonstrated over false gods, such as Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who invaded Judah and laid siege to Jerusalem.
