Baal worship was prevalent in the region, often associated with fertility rites and idolatry. The tearing down of these altars signifies a return to monotheistic worship and a rejection of Canaanite religious practices. This act fulfills the Deuteronomic law, which commands the destruction of pagan altars (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>).<p><b>and he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them</b><br>Incense altars were used in pagan rituals to offer fragrant smoke to deities. By cutting them to pieces, Josiah was not only physically dismantling these objects but also symbolically severing the spiritual ties they represented. This action echoes the reforms of previous kings like Hezekiah, who also sought to purify worship practices (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p><b>He shattered the Asherah poles</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the goddess Asherah, often placed near altars. Their destruction was a direct attack on the syncretism that had infiltrated Israelite worship. This act aligns with the commandment against idolatry found in <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, where God instructs the Israelites to break down their altars and cut down their Asherah poles.<p><b>the carved idols, and the cast images</b><br>Carved and cast idols were common in ancient Near Eastern religions, representing various deities. The destruction of these idols was a clear statement against idolatry, reinforcing the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This act also prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over false gods and spiritual powers (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>crushed them to dust</b><br>Crushing the idols to dust signifies total obliteration, ensuring that they could not be reconstructed or revered again. This thorough destruction is reminiscent of Moses grinding the golden calf to powder (<a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>), symbolizing the complete eradication of idolatry.<p><b>and scattered them over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them</b><br>Scattering the dust over the graves of idol worshipers was a symbolic act of defilement, indicating that those who participated in idolatry were spiritually dead. This action underscores the seriousness of idolatry and its consequences, as seen in the prophetic warnings throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh.
