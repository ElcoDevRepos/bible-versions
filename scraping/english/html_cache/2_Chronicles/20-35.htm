His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh. He is often remembered for his faithfulness to God, as seen in his earlier actions, such as seeking God's guidance in battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-30</a>). His reign is generally dated to the 9th century BC. Jehoshaphat's efforts to strengthen Judah spiritually and militarily are well-documented, and he is praised for his judicial reforms and educational initiatives (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>).<p><b>made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel</b><br>Ahaziah was the son of Ahab and Jezebel, rulers of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. His reign was marked by idolatry and continued the sinful practices of his parents, particularly the worship of Baal. The alliance between Jehoshaphat and Ahaziah is significant because it represents a political and military partnership between the two kingdoms, which were often at odds. This alliance is seen as a departure from Jehoshaphat's earlier faithfulness, as it involved cooperation with a king who did not follow the ways of the Lord. The alliance included a joint venture to build ships at Ezion-Geber, which ultimately failed (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36-37</a>).<p><b>who acted wickedly</b><br>Ahaziah's wickedness is highlighted in the biblical narrative, as he continued the idolatrous practices of his father Ahab. His reign is characterized by a lack of devotion to Yahweh and a continuation of the sins that led to the spiritual decline of Israel. The Bible often contrasts the righteous kings of Judah with the wicked kings of Israel, and Ahaziah's actions are a prime example of the latter. The alliance with Jehoshaphat is criticized by the prophet Eliezer, who rebukes Jehoshaphat for aligning himself with someone who did evil in the sight of the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>).

God had miraculously delivered Judah, yet only &#8220;later&#8221; does the chronicler reveal a fresh test. Scripture often shows that spiritual highs are followed by temptations (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18&#8211;19</a> with Elijah; <a href="/bsb/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3&#8211;4</a> with Jesus). The lesson is plain:<p>&#8226; Previous victories do not guarantee present faithfulness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ongoing dependence on the Lord remains essential even after great triumphs (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat king of Judah</b><p>Jehoshaphat was a reforming, God-fearing ruler (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>), yet he had a blind spot&#8212;political partnerships with the northern kingdom. Earlier he joined Ahab in battle and was rebuked by the prophet Jehu: &#8220;Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). Now he repeats the pattern. His life reminds us that:<p>&#8226; A generally godly leader can still fall into recurring compromise (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Sins we do not decisively forsake tend to resurface (<a href="/bsb/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a> & 26 show Abraham and Isaac repeating the same deception).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>made an alliance</b><p>The alliance concerned a fleet of trading ships bound for Tarshish (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-36.htm">2 Chronicles 20:36</a>). God had warned Israel against covenants with ungodly nations that would draw hearts away (<a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). Jehoshaphat ignored those commands, seeking economic gain instead of God&#8217;s counsel. Comparably, the New Testament cautions, &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Key dangers of such alliances:<p>&#8226; Compromise of convictions for shared interests.<p>&#8226; Dependence on human resources rather than divine provision (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Exposure to the partner&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Ahaziah king of Israel</b><p>Ahaziah, son of Ahab and Jezebel, reigned over Israel in Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51-53</a>). Scripture records: &#8220;He did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father and mother&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>). By joining with Ahaziah, Jehoshaphat aligned the house of David with a dynasty steeped in idolatry and bloodshed. Political convenience blurred moral clarity&#8212;a common Old Testament theme (see King Solomon&#8217;s later years, <a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who acted wickedly</b><p>The verse ends with God&#8217;s verdict on Ahaziah. His wickedness was not a private matter but a public, covenant-breaking rebellion. Because Jehoshaphat partnered with him, the judgment touched Judah&#8217;s venture: &#8220;Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works. So the ships were wrecked&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>). Consequences underline that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people cannot expect His blessing while yoking themselves to wickedness (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience safeguards prosperity; disobedience invites loss (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a> teaches that after great spiritual victories we must remain alert. Jehoshaphat, a good king, repeated a familiar mistake&#8212;partnering with an ungodly ruler. The text warns that alliances with the wicked, however practical they appear, offend the Lord and bring His discipline. Lasting success rests on steadfast obedience and uncompromised trust in God alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">And after this.</span>--The chronicler has omitted the notice that "Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel" (<a href="/1_kings/22-44.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.">1Kings 22:44</a>), and now he omits two other short verses of the parallel account, viz., <a href="/context/1_kings/22-46.htm" title="And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.">1Kings 22:46-47</a> : "And the remnant of the sodomites, which had remained in the days of his father Asa, he consumed out of the land. There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king." The former omission is perfectly natural, as the <span class= "ital">Q?d?shim</span> were not mentioned in Asa's reign (comp. <a href="/1_kings/15-12.htm" title="And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.">1Kings 15:12</a>); and the latter is probably due to the fact that it was the religious aspect, and not the political antecedents, of Jehoshaphat s conduct that most interested the chronicler. Hence also the didactic tone of the following verses as compared with <a href="/context/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48-49</a>. The expression, "after this," can only mean after the overthrow of the three nations (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2Chronicles 20:1-30</a>). As Ahaziah began to reign in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, and reigned two years (<a href="/1_kings/22-51.htm" title="Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.">1Kings 22:51</a>), the league between them was formed in the seventeenth or eighteenth year of the king of Judah. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after this</span>. The historical episode of these three verses (35-37) is evidently misplaced. As Ahaziah succeeded his father Ahab in Jehoshaphat's seventeenth year, we of course are at no loss to fix the time of Jehoshaphat's "joining himself with Ahaziah." He had "joined himself" with Ahab, and had smarted for it, and yet "after" that, he "joined himself" with his son Ahaziah. We do not doubt that the "who" of this verse refers to Ahaziah, not, as some think, to Jehoshaphat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Later,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
