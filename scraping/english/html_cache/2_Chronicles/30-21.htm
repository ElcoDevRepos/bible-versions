Jerusalem was the spiritual heart of Israel, and its significance is rooted in its selection by God as the place for His name to dwell (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). The gathering of Israelites here underscores the unity and communal aspect of worship, as well as the importance of pilgrimage to the holy city, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p><b>celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days</b><br>The Feast of Unleavened Bread is a significant Jewish festival that follows Passover, commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their liberation from slavery (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17-20</a>). The seven-day duration symbolizes completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. This feast required the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing the removal of sin and corruption, and it was a time of reflection and dedication to God.<p><b>with great joy</b><br>The joy experienced during this celebration reflects the spiritual renewal and revival under King Hezekiah's reforms.

This dedication to daily worship highlights the importance of consistent devotion and the role of spiritual leaders in guiding the community in worship.<p><b>accompanied by loud instruments of praise to the LORD</b><br>The use of loud instruments in worship was a common practice in Israelite worship, as seen in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/150-3.htm">Psalm 150:3-5</a>). Instruments such as trumpets, cymbals, and harps were used to enhance the worship experience and express exuberant praise to God.
