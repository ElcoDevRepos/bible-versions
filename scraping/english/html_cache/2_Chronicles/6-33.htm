In the context of Solomon's prayer, it reflects the belief that God, though dwelling in heaven, is attentive to the prayers of His people on earth. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>, which speaks of the Lord's throne in heaven, and <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where God declares heaven as His throne. The temple in Jerusalem, though a physical structure, is a symbolic representation of God's presence among His people.<p><b>and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You</b><br>Solomon's prayer includes a request for God to respond to the prayers of foreigners, highlighting the inclusivity of God's covenant. This reflects the Abrahamic promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where all nations are to be blessed through Abraham's descendants. It underscores the universal scope of God's plan, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation that salvation through Christ is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You</b><br>This phrase speaks to the missional aspect of Israel's identity, intended to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The knowledge and fear of God's name imply reverence and recognition of His sovereignty. This anticipates the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, furthering the theme of God's desire for all people to know Him.<p><b>as do Your people Israel</b><br>Here, Solomon draws a parallel between the foreigner and Israel, suggesting that the same reverence and relationship Israel has with God should extend to all nations. This reflects the covenantal relationship established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), where Israel is called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, serving as a model for others.<p><b>and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name</b><br>The temple is not just a physical structure but a testament to God's presence and His covenant with Israel. It serves as a focal point for worship and a symbol of God's name and glory. This is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), indicating that God's presence now dwells within His people, furthering the idea of the temple as a representation of God's name and presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner</a></b><br>A non-Israelite who comes to the temple to pray, seeking the God of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>Described as God's dwelling place, from where He hears prayers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The physical structure built by Solomon, dedicated to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples_of_the_earth.htm">Peoples of the Earth</a></b><br>Refers to all nations and ethnic groups outside of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_god's_kingdom.htm">Inclusivity of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>God's heart is for all nations to know Him, not just Israel.
