Jerusalem was the city where the temple built by Solomon stood, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Jehoshaphat's residence in Jerusalem signifies his role as a leader who was expected to uphold the religious and moral standards established by his predecessors.<p><b>and once again he went out among the people</b><br>Jehoshaphat's action of going out among the people highlights his commitment to personal leadership and direct involvement with his subjects. This reflects a king who was not isolated in his palace but actively engaged with the populace. It suggests a return to earlier practices of righteous leadership, reminiscent of the judges who led Israel before the monarchy was established.<p><b>from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim</b><br>This phrase indicates the geographical extent of Jehoshaphat's influence, covering the southernmost part of Judah (Beersheba) to the northern territories (hill country of Ephraim). Beersheba was a significant city in the southern region, often used to denote the southern boundary of Israel, while Ephraim was a central region in the northern kingdom. This journey underscores Jehoshaphat's effort to unify the nation under the worship of the LORD, bridging the divide between the northern and southern tribes.<p><b>and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers</b><br>Jehoshaphat's mission was to lead a spiritual revival, turning the people back to the worship of Yahweh, the God of their ancestors. This phrase indicates a return to covenant faithfulness, reminiscent of the reforms of previous leaders like Asa, Jehoshaphat's father. It reflects the cyclical pattern of Israel's history, where periods of apostasy were followed by renewal and repentance. This turning back to God is a theme throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for continual reformation and adherence to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to bring the people back to the worship of the LORD.

The local worship of the God of Israel "necessarily came into contact with the Canaanite service of Baal, and, apart from the fact that the luxurious festivals of the latter had a natural attraction for the sensuous Semitic nature of the Hebrews, there was a more innocent motive which tended to assimilate the two worships. The offerings and festivals of Jehovah were acts of homage in which the people consecrated to Him the good things of His bestowing. These were no longer the scanty products of pastoral life, but the rich gifts of a land of corn and wine . . . Thus, the religious feasts necessarily assumed a new and more luxurious character, and, rejoicing before Jehovah in the enjoyment of the good things of Canaan, the Israelites naturally imitated the agricultural feasts which the Canaanites celebrated before Baal. It is not, therefore, surprising that we find many indications of a gradual fusion between the two worships; that many of the great Hebrew sanctuaries are demonstrably identical with Canaanite holy places; that the autumn feast, usually known as the Feast of Tabernacles, has a close parallel in the Canaanite Vintage Feast, that Canaanite immorality tainted the worship of Jehovah; and that at length Jehovah Himself, who was addressed by His worshippers by the same general appellation of 'Baal' or 'Lord' which was the ordinary title of the Canaanite nature-god, was hardly distinguished by the masses who worshipped at the local shrines from the local Baalim of their Canaanite neighbours" (Prof. Robertson Smith, <span class= "ital">Prophets of Israel,</span> p. 38).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Beershsba to Mount Ephraim</span>. The length of the good land is not to be quoted, as of old, the undivided "Dan to Beersheba," but Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-16.htm">2 Chronicles 13:16-19</a>). Jehoshaphat makes another conscientious and vigorous endeavour to reform his own kingdom, to keep it steadfast in the worship of God, and free from idolatry. It is to be noticed that he does not turn away his ear from the rebuke which had been given him, but turns his heart to it. As it does not appear that he broke with Israel and Israel's kings (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35, 37</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 14, 24</a>), it is possible, especially in view of ver. 37 in our ch. 20, that the severity of the Divine rebuke was understood to apply to the occasions which found Jehoshaphat in alliance with a king notably bad, and for some supposed chance of advantage to himself. This last element of consideration will difference sufficiently the two cases just cited, to wit, the case in which Jehoshaphat joined himself with Azariah, and is sternly "prophesied against," and that in which he helped Jehoram, and through Elisha's intervention gained him the day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3092.htm">Strong's 3092: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoshaphat -- 'the LORD has judged', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
