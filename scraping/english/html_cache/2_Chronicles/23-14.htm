His leadership in this context highlights the significant influence of religious leaders in political matters in ancient Israel. The "commanders of hundreds" indicates a structured military organization, suggesting a well-prepared plan to overthrow Athaliah, the usurper queen. This action reflects the intertwining of religious and military efforts to uphold God's covenant with David's lineage.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.&#8221;</b><br>Jehoiada's command to bring Athaliah out "between the ranks" signifies a strategic move to ensure her capture without defiling the temple. The instruction to execute anyone who follows her underscores the seriousness of purging idolatry and rebellion from Judah.

The Heb. words are so nearly alike that one may easily be a corruption of the other. The Syriac and Arabic agree with Kings. The LXX. gives both readings.<p><span class= "bld">Have her forth of the ranges.</span>--<span class= "ital">Make her go out between the ranks of guards.</span><p><span class= "bld">Let him be slain.</span>--An explanation of the form used in Kings (the infinitive).<p><span class= "bld">Slay her not.</span>--<span class= "ital">Ye must not slay her.</span> Kings, "Let her not be slain." So the Syriac here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brought out</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, for "commanded" in the parallel, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>; and this is probably right, the Hebrew in our text probably a clerical or copyist's error. <span class="cmt_word">The ranges</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word is found only in three other places, viz. twice in the parallel (its vers. 8, 15), Revised Version "ranks," and in <a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>, where it is rendered in the Authorized Version "the boards," but in the Revised Version "the planks<span class="accented"></span>," and margin "rows." The ranges are commonly supposed to mean the ranks or rows of soldiers. The Vulgate (<span class="accented">septa templi</span>) has understood them to mean the precincts of the temple.
