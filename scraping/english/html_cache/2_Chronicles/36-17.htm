The "He" refers to God, who orchestrates events according to His sovereign will. The "king of the Chaldeans" is Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of Babylon. The Chaldeans were a Semitic people who became dominant in Babylon. This event fulfills prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, where God declares He will summon Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment upon Judah for their disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>who put their young men to the sword in the sanctuary</b><br>The sanctuary refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place for the Israelites. The act of killing young men in the sanctuary signifies the desecration of what was holy. This reflects the severity of God's judgment, as the temple was the center of Jewish worship and identity. The historical context is the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC, which led to the destruction of the temple, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>.<p><b>sparing neither young men nor young women, neither elderly nor infirm</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality and impartiality of the destruction. The Babylonians showed no mercy, reflecting the completeness of God's judgment. This mirrors the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-50</a>, where God warns of a nation that will not respect the old or show favor to the young if Israel disobeys. The cultural context highlights the brutality of ancient warfare, where entire populations could be decimated.<p><b>God gave them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>This statement underscores God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His prophetic word. Despite the Babylonians' actions, it is ultimately God who delivers Judah into their hands as a consequence of their persistent sin.

After centuries of prophetic warnings, He now uses Babylon as His chosen instrument of discipline&#8212;just as He had earlier used Assyria against the Northern Kingdom. Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord sovereignly raising up nations to fulfill His purposes (see <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>).

The verse echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>, where God warned of &#8220;a ruthless nation that shows no respect for the old or pity for the young.&#8221; <a href="/lamentations/2-21.htm">Lamentations 2:21</a> laments, &#8220;Young and old lie together in the dust of the streets,&#8221; and <a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a> records a vision of judgment that begins &#8220;with the old men.&#8221; The point is not gratuitous violence but the sobering reality that sin carries devastating consequences for every demographic when a society hardens itself against the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God gave them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar</b><p>Once more the text stresses divine sovereignty: &#8220;God gave&#8221; them over.

The exile fulfills earlier prophetic promises, including the seventy-year desolation Jeremiah foretold (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). Even Daniel opens with this truth: &#8220;The Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>). Human power sits on a chain held firmly by the Lord of history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a> records the climax of Judah&#8217;s rebellion: the Lord Himself brings Babylon to execute judgment. The temple is desecrated, every age group suffers, and the nation is handed over to Nebuchadnezzar. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God&#8217;s warnings are real, His sovereignty comprehensive, and His holiness non-negotiable&#8212;yet within the larger biblical story, even this judgment prepares the way for future restoration when God will once again show mercy to a repentant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Therefore he brought up.</span>--<span class= "ital">And He caused to come up;</span> alluding to "the wrath . . . <span class= "ital">went up</span>."<p><span class= "bld">In the house of their sanctuary.</span>--Which they had polluted (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:14</a>).
