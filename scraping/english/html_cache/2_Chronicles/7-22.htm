It implies a communal understanding and acknowledgment of the reasons behind the nation's downfall. This reflects the biblical theme of accountability and the importance of communal memory in understanding God's actions.<p><b>&#8216;Because they have forsaken the LORD,</b><br>Forsaking the LORD indicates a deliberate turning away from God, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where faithfulness was expected. The forsaking of God often led to severe consequences, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>the God of their fathers,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of the covenant relationship established with the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the historical and familial connection to God, reminding the Israelites of their heritage and the faithfulness of their ancestors. This connection is a call to return to the faith of their forefathers.<p><b>who brought them out of the land of Egypt,</b><br>This reference to the Exodus is a reminder of God's deliverance and faithfulness. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and God's power. It serves as a constant reminder of God's ability to save and the expectation of Israel's loyalty in response to His mighty acts.<p><b>and have embraced other gods,</b><br>Embracing other gods signifies idolatry, which was strictly forbidden in the Ten Commandments. This act of spiritual adultery was a major sin that led to Israel's downfall. The allure of surrounding nations' gods often tempted Israel, leading them away from exclusive worship of Yahweh.<p><b>worshiping and serving them&#8212;</b><br>Worship and service to other gods indicate a complete devotion and submission, which should have been directed solely to Yahweh. This phrase highlights the depth of Israel's apostasy, as worship involves both heart and action. It reflects the seriousness of idolatry as a betrayal of the covenant.<p><b>because of this, He has brought all this disaster upon them.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The disaster refers to the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness, often manifesting as military defeat, exile, or other forms of judgment. This phrase underscores the principle of divine retribution, where disobedience leads to punishment. It serves as a warning and a call to repentance, aligning with the prophetic messages throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Therefore, the covenant curses fell exactly as foretold. The verse stands as a sobering reminder that God&#8217;s blessings are tied to loyalty, His judgments are just, and His faithfulness&#8212;whether in mercy or discipline&#8212;remains unshakable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And it shall be answered.</span>--<span class= "ital">And men shall</span> <span class= "ital">say.</span><p><span class= "bld">Hath he brought.</span>--Kings, "hath Jehovah brought."
