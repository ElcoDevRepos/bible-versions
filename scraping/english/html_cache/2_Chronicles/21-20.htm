This transition of power is significant as it marks a shift from the relatively righteous reign of Jehoshaphat to a more tumultuous period. Jehoram's age suggests he had some experience and maturity, yet his reign was marked by poor decisions. His marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, indicates a political alliance with the northern kingdom of Israel, which often led to the introduction of idolatry and pagan practices into Judah.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years</b><br>Jehoram's reign lasted eight years, a relatively short period compared to other kings of Judah. His rule was characterized by significant moral and spiritual decline. The city of Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, was adversely affected by his leadership. Jehoram's reign saw the introduction of Baal worship, influenced by his wife Athaliah, which led to divine judgment upon the nation. This period is a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the impact of leadership on a nation's spiritual health.<p><b>He died, to no one&#8217;s regret</b><br>The phrase "to no one's regret" underscores the negative impact of Jehoram's reign on the people of Judah. His oppressive rule, including the murder of his own brothers to secure his throne, alienated him from his subjects. The lack of mourning at his death reflects the people's relief at the end of his tyrannical leadership. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, which contrasts the memory of the righteous with the name of the wicked that will rot.<p><b>and was buried in the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, where the kings of Judah were traditionally buried. Despite his failures, Jehoram was still buried in this prestigious location, indicating his royal status. However, his burial here does not imply honor, as the subsequent phrase clarifies. The City of David holds significant historical and archaeological importance, being the site of King David's original fortress and the center of his kingdom.<p><b>but not in the tombs of the kings</b><br>Jehoram's exclusion from the royal tombs signifies a lack of honor and respect. The tombs of the kings were reserved for those who were esteemed and honored in their death. This exclusion serves as a posthumous judgment on Jehoram's reign, highlighting the disgrace he brought upon himself and his lineage. It reflects the biblical principle that one's actions and legacy determine their honor, as seen in the contrasting burial honors given to other kings of Judah who followed God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The son of Jehoshaphat, Jehoram became king of Judah and is noted for his wicked reign, which led to his unpopularity and lack of mourning at his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where Jehoram reigned as king.

According to <a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>, &#8220;Jehoram walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done,&#8221; showing that the decisive voice in his life was not God&#8217;s Word but ungodly family ties (see also 2 Chron 21:6).<p>&#8226; His father Jehoshaphat had modeled faithfulness (2 Chron 17:3-6), but Jehoram chose the path of compromise, reminding us that personal decisions, not heritage, set the course of a life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.</b><p>&#8226; An eight-year reign is brief compared to David&#8217;s forty (<a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) or even Asa&#8217;s forty-one (2 Chron 16:13). Short reigns often signal divine judgment (compare <a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; During those years Judah experienced revolt from Edom (2 Chron 21:8-10) and Libnah, outward signs of divine displeasure announced in Elijah&#8217;s letter (2 Chron 21:12-15).<p>&#8226; The record offers no achievements worth celebrating; the chronicler highlights turbulence rather than triumph, teaching that a life lived apart from God, however prominent, leaves little of lasting worth (<a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He died, to no one&#8217;s regret</b><p>&#8226; The line literally states that no one mourned him. <a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a> observes, &#8220;The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot.&#8221; Jehoram&#8217;s passing elicited relief, not reverence.<p>&#8226; Contrast Solomon: &#8220;All Israel mourned for him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>), and the godly Stephen: &#8220;God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-2.htm">Acts 8:2</a>). The difference is moral character.<p>&#8226; Elijah had foretold that Jehoram would suffer &#8220;severe illness&#8221; and die &#8220;with no relief&#8221; (2 Chron 21:15). His unmourned death underscores that sin steals both health and honor (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</b><p>&#8226; Burial in Jerusalem honored covenant heritage, yet exclusion from the royal tombs signaled public disgrace. Similar shame befell Joash (2 Chron 24:25) and Uzziah (2 Chron 26:23) when they turned from the LORD.<p>&#8226; According to 2 Chron 21:19, the people &#8220;made no fire in his honor, as they had for his fathers.&#8221; Even customary marks of respect were withheld, fulfilling God&#8217;s warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45-47</a> that covenant disloyalty ends in dishonor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> celebrates the opposite outcome: &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord&#8230; their deeds will follow them.&#8221; Jehoram&#8217;s deeds followed him into infamy, not blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jehoram&#8217;s story shows that a king&#8217;s title cannot rescue him from the consequences of rebellion. Though he began with every advantage&#8212;royal pedigree, strong city, covenant promises&#8212;his deliberate choice to imitate Ahab brought a short, troubled reign, an unlamented death, and a dishonorable burial. Scripture&#8217;s verdict is clear: lasting honor is reserved for those who walk with the LORD; all others, however powerful, will find their legacy empty and forgotten.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Thirty and two years.</span>--The word "years" has fallen out of the Hebrew text; but some MSS. contain it.
