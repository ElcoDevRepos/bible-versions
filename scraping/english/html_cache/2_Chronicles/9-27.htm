Silver, a precious metal, was so abundant that it was likened to the commonality of stones, which were plentiful in the region. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon of unparalleled wealth and wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). The economic prosperity can be attributed to Solomon's extensive trade networks and alliances, particularly with Hiram of Tyre, which brought in vast amounts of wealth (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>). This abundance of silver also signifies the peace and stability of Solomon's kingdom, as wealth often correlates with a lack of conflict and strong governance.<p><b>and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills</b><br>Cedar wood, especially from Lebanon, was highly prized in the ancient Near East for its quality and durability. Solomon's use of cedar in construction, notably in the Temple and his palace, underscores the grandeur of his building projects (<a href="/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9-10</a>). The comparison to sycamore, a more common and less valuable wood found in the lowlands, emphasizes the extraordinary availability of cedar during Solomon's reign. This abundance is a testament to Solomon's successful trade agreements and his ability to procure resources from distant lands. The use of cedar also has symbolic significance, as it was associated with strength and longevity, qualities attributed to Solomon's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Solomon was the son of King David and Bathsheba.

Earlier passages (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-1.htm">2 Chronicles 9:1&#8211;26</a>) describe Solomon&#8217;s wisdom, international fame, and vast wealth&#8212;each gift flowing from God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>. By identifying Solomon as &#8216;the king,&#8217; the verse ties his unprecedented prosperity directly to the covenant God made with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon&#8217;s prosperity is therefore not merely political success; it is visible confirmation of God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/8-23.htm">1 Kings 8:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones</b><p>&#8220;[He] made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones&#8221; paints a vivid picture of economic abundance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a> records a similar statement, showing this was not an isolated moment but an ongoing reality throughout Solomon&#8217;s reign.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a> parallels the same wording, reinforcing the eyewitness reliability of the Chronicler&#8217;s report.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-12</a> promised tangible blessings for covenant faithfulness; Solomon&#8217;s era visibly fulfills that promise.<p>Stones were everywhere in ancient Jerusalem. Saying silver was just as plentiful stresses that wealth had become everyday, ordinary. Such overflow points to God&#8217;s hand, because no human strategy alone could have elevated Israel so far above surrounding nations (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills</b><p>Cedar was prized for durability and fragrance, imported mainly from Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-10</a>). By contrast, sycamore figs grew wild and plentiful in the lowlands (<a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>; <a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>). To say cedar became as common as sycamore is to say luxury became as ordinary as common lumber.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>, a messianic prayer likely penned for Solomon, envisions hillside abundance; here we see that prayer answered in part.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a> later contrasts cedar and sycamore to illustrate pride; in Solomon&#8217;s day the abundance of cedar displays God-given greatness without the later decline that Isaiah addresses.<p>The statement also hints at kingdom-wide construction: temples, palaces, and fortified cities rose quickly because supply chains were overflowing (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/9-27.htm">2 Chronicles 9:27</a> is a snapshot of divine blessing poured out on Solomon&#8217;s kingdom. God kept His word, giving wealth so vast that silver lost its luster of rarity and cedar lost its status as exotic.
