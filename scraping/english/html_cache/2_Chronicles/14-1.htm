"Rested with his fathers" is a common biblical expression signifying death and burial, often used for the kings of Israel and Judah. It implies a continuation of lineage and tradition, as well as a peaceful passing. Abijah's reign was marked by conflict with Jeroboam, king of Israel, but he is noted for a significant victory over Israel, attributed to his reliance on God (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18</a>).<p><b>and was buried in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the ancient part of the city captured by King David from the Jebusites. It became the burial place for many of the kings of Judah, signifying honor and continuity with David's legacy. This burial location underscores the legitimacy of Abijah's rule as part of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>And his son Asa reigned in his place,</b><br>Asa's ascension to the throne marks a transition in leadership. Asa is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, aligning with the covenantal faithfulness expected of a Davidic king. His reign is characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the practices of some of his predecessors. Asa's actions are seen as a fulfillment of the Deuteronomic ideal of kingship (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>).<p><b>and in his days the land was at peace for ten years.</b><br>The peace during Asa's early reign is significant, as it allowed for religious and social reforms. This period of peace is seen as a divine blessing for Asa's faithfulness and obedience to God. It also provided stability and prosperity for Judah, enabling Asa to strengthen the nation's defenses and infrastructure. The peace can be viewed as a type of the ultimate peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who brings spiritual rest and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned before Asa.

The phrase &#8220;rested with his fathers&#8221; is used repeatedly in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; 2 Chron 12:16) to describe the physical death of a king and his joining the faithful who preceded him.<p>&#8226; Scripture treats death for God&#8217;s people as rest (<a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>), affirming hope beyond the grave and underscoring God&#8217;s ongoing plan despite individual mortality.<p>&#8226; By immediately noting Abijah&#8217;s &#8220;rest,&#8221; Chronicles reminds readers that leadership changes, but the Lord&#8217;s purposes are unwavering (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was buried in the City of David</b><p>&#8226; Burial &#8220;in the City of David&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>) ties Abijah to the covenant promise given to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The chronicler highlights Jerusalem&#8217;s centrality in God&#8217;s redemptive story (2 Chron 6:6).<p>&#8226; This burial location affirms both the historicity of events and the legitimacy of Judah&#8217;s royal line as guardians of true worship (2 Chron 21:13).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Asa reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; Succession underscores God&#8217;s orderly governance (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s reign, unlike many kings, is introduced positively: &#8220;Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God&#8221; (2 Chron 14:2).<p>&#8226; The transition also signals a shift from a mixed legacy under Abijah (<a href="/1_kings/15-3.htm">1 Kings 15:3</a>) to reform and wholehearted devotion under Asa (2 Chron 15:8&#8211;15).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in his days the land was at peace for ten years</b><p>&#8226; Peace is presented as God&#8217;s blessing for righteousness (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Ten years of rest gave Asa time to fortify cities, abolish idolatry, and lead spiritual renewal (2 Chron 14:4&#8211;7).<p>&#8226; The chronicler later emphasizes that this rest depended on continued reliance on the LORD (2 Chron 15:19; 16:7&#8211;9), teaching that peace is conditional on obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">2 Chronicles 14:1</a> records a seamless transfer of leadership from Abijah to Asa, rooting the narrative in real time, place, and lineage.

It is against that suggestion that there is no sign of this, by word or deed, in what is here said of the beginning of Asa's reign; the signs are to the contrary, especially taking into the question the indications given us respecting the tendencies, if not contradicted, of the queen-mother Maachah (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and it is not supposable that a boy of twelve years of age could contradict them.

No doubt one cause of this was the defeat that Jeroboam and Israel had sustained at the hands of Abijah (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18-20</a>). It appears also, from <a href="/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, that after that defeat a league was instituted between Abijah and the then King of Syria: "There is a league between me and thee, and between <span class="accented">my father and thy father."</span> And these things, with Israel's new kings, and <span class="accented">perhaps</span> Asa's extreme youth, would have favoured the repose of the land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/14-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Abijah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_29.htm">Strong's 29: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abijah -- 'Yah is my father', an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
