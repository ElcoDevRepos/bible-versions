The "sight of the LORD" suggests that God's omniscience allows Him to see and judge human actions. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to describe the actions of kings who led Israel or Judah away from worshiping Yahweh. The standard for what is considered "evil" is based on the covenantal laws given to Israel, particularly those found in the Torah.<p><b>as his father Manasseh had done</b><br>Manasseh, Amon's father, was one of the most notorious kings of Judah, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin. His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>, where he is described as having rebuilt high places, erected altars to Baal, and even practiced child sacrifice. This comparison highlights a generational pattern of sin, suggesting that Amon followed in the footsteps of his father's earlier, unrepentant years. However, it is important to note that Manasseh eventually repented, as recorded later in <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>, but Amon did not follow this path of repentance.<p><b>Amon served and sacrificed to all the idols</b><br>The act of serving and sacrificing to idols indicates a complete departure from the worship of Yahweh, violating the first two commandments given to Moses. This behavior reflects the syncretism that plagued Israel and Judah, where foreign deities were worshiped alongside or instead of Yahweh. The mention of "all the idols" suggests a comprehensive embrace of pagan practices, which would have included Canaanite, Assyrian, and possibly Egyptian deities, reflecting the political and cultural influences of surrounding nations.<p><b>that his father Manasseh had made</b><br>This phrase underscores the lasting impact of Manasseh's idolatry, as the idols he created continued to be a snare for his son and the nation. It highlights the tangible legacy of sin, where physical objects of idolatry remained in the land, leading subsequent generations astray. The reference to Manasseh's idols also serves as a reminder of the importance of removing sources of temptation and sin, as seen in the reforms of kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who actively destroyed such idols to restore true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>The son of Manasseh and king of Judah who followed in his father's earlier sinful ways, leading the nation into idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>Amon's father, who was known for his initial reign of idolatry and evil but later repented and turned back to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Amon reigned as king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that Amon and Manasseh created, representing a departure from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is grieved by the idolatry and evil practices of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_parental_example.htm">The Influence of Parental Example</a></b><br>Amon's actions were heavily influenced by his father's earlier life.

God sees and judges evil, whether committed personally or copied from forebears. Idolatry is more than an ancient temptation; it is any allegiance that displaces wholehearted devotion to the LORD. Amon&#8217;s brief reign demonstrates how quickly a nation&#8212;or a life&#8212;can slide back into darkness when past sins are tolerated instead of eradicated. The verse calls every reader to break destructive cycles, root out lingering idols, and walk in unwavering obedience before the Lord who sees all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">For Amon sacrificed.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and to all the carven images which Manasseh his father had made did Amon sacrifice.</span> (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/21-21.htm" title="And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:">2Kings 21:21</a>, "and he walked in all the way wherein his father had walked, and served the idols which his father had served, and worshipped them." <span class= "ital">Idols</span> in the above passage is <span class= "ital">gillulim, "</span>dunglings," a term nowhere used by the chronicler.) The statement of our text seems to imply that the "carven images" made by Manasseh had not been destroyed, but only cast aside. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/33-15.htm" title="And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.">2Chronicles 33:15</a>.) It argues a defect of judgment to say with Reuss that the reforms of Manasseh are rendered doubtful by it. The whole history is a succession of reforms followed by relapses; and the words of the sacred writer need not be supposed to mean that the images which Amon worshipped were the very ones which his penitent father had discarded, but only images of the same imaginary gods.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/33-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
