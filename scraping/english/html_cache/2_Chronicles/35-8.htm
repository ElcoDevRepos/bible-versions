In the context of ancient Israel, offerings were a significant part of religious observance, and the willingness to give underscores a heart aligned with God's purposes. The officials' contributions ensured that the Passover could be celebrated properly, emphasizing the communal aspect of worship. This act of giving can be seen as a reflection of the principles found in <a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>, where the Israelites gave willingly for the construction of the Tabernacle.<p><b>Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officials of the house of God,</b><br>These individuals were key leaders in the religious life of Judah. Hilkiah, likely the high priest, played a crucial role in the religious reforms under King Josiah, including the discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). Zechariah and Jehiel, though less is known about them, were significant figures in the administration of the temple. Their leadership and contributions were vital in organizing the Passover, a central event in Jewish worship. This reflects the importance of godly leadership in guiding the people in worship and obedience to God.<p><b>gave the priests 2,600 Passover offerings and 300 bulls.</b><br>The large number of offerings provided by these leaders indicates the scale and importance of the Passover celebration. The Passover was a commemoration of the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. The provision of 2,600 Passover offerings ensured that all participants could partake in the feast, symbolizing unity and shared faith. The 300 bulls, likely used for additional sacrifices, highlight the abundance and completeness of the offerings. This generosity can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Passover Lamb, providing salvation for all who believe (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).
