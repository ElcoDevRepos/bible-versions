The articles refer to the sacred items used in temple worship, which had been neglected or defiled. The act of preparing and consecrating these items signifies a return to proper worship and reverence for God. In the context of the Old Testament, consecration involved purification rituals, often using water or blood, to set apart items for holy use. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and the need for purification before approaching God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/29.htm">Exodus 29</a> and <a href="/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8</a>.<p><b>that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign.</b><br>King Ahaz was known for his idolatry and unfaithfulness to the covenant with God. He introduced pagan practices and desecrated the temple, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>. His actions led to spiritual decline in Judah. The casting aside of sacred articles symbolizes the rejection of God's commandments and the embrace of foreign gods. This historical context highlights the consequences of turning away from God and the importance of faithful leadership.<p><b>They are now in front of the altar of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The placement of the consecrated articles in front of the altar signifies their readiness for use in worship. The altar of the LORD was central to Israelite worship, representing God's presence and the place of sacrifice. This act of restoration is a physical and spiritual renewal, aligning with the reforms initiated by King Hezekiah, who sought to restore true worship in Judah. The altar's significance is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ is seen as the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore proper worship in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>Hezekiah's father, known for his unfaithfulness and idolatry, which led to the desecration of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites_and_priests.htm">Levites and Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for the cleansing and consecration of the temple and its articles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_the_lord.htm">Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem, which had been neglected and defiled under Ahaz's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration.htm">Consecration</a></b><br>The act of making something sacred or dedicating it to the service of God, which was necessary for the temple articles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consecration.htm">The Importance of Consecration</a></b><br>Just as the temple articles were consecrated for God's service, believers are called to consecrate their lives to God, setting themselves apart for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_renewal.htm">Restoration and Renewal</a></b><br>Hezekiah's actions demonstrate the possibility of spiritual renewal and restoration, even after a period of unfaithfulness.

The same two-step pattern appears earlier in the chapter when the priests &#8220;assembled&#8230;consecrated themselves&#8221; before entering the temple (2 Chron 29:15, 5). It echoes the way Moses treated tabernacle furniture (<a href="/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>) and reminds us that revival always marries diligent effort with spiritual devotion. Like Paul&#8217;s call to be &#8220;vessels for honorable use, set apart as holy&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>), the verse insists that usefulness follows consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the articles</b><p>Nothing is left out. The temple held lampstands, censers, tables, trumpets, bowls&#8212;each designed by God and worthy of restoration (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>). By noting &#8220;all,&#8221; the text highlights thorough obedience. Half-hearted reform would not satisfy a holy God (2 Chron 31:21). Today, believers are urged to surrender every corner of life, not just the convenient parts (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign</b><p>Ahaz had shuttered the temple, broken the sacred vessels, and adopted pagan altars (2 Chron 28:22-25; <a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-18</a>). &#8220;Unfaithfulness&#8221; is literally apostasy&#8212;turning from covenant loyalty. Sin always discards what is holy, but God delights to restore what others have despised (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s generation refuses to let yesterday&#8217;s rebellion define today&#8217;s worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are now in front of the altar of the LORD</b><p>The cleansed items are brought right to the place of sacrifice, ready for immediate service. The altar is the meeting point between a sinful people and a forgiving God (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). By publicly displaying the renewed vessels &#8220;in front of the altar,&#8221; the Levites declare:<p>&#8226; The work is complete&#8212;nothing more is hidden in storage.<p>&#8226; The nation can resume true worship without delay (2 Chron 29:35-36).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence and favor are again central to Judah&#8217;s life (<a href="/exodus/40-29.htm">Exodus 40:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-19.htm">2 Chronicles 29:19</a> records the joyful end of a meticulous cleansing: every article once profaned by Ahaz is now purified and placed before God&#8217;s altar. The verse teaches that genuine revival involves practical restoration, wholehearted obedience, rejection of past unfaithfulness, and a fresh focus on sacrificial worship. When God&#8217;s people prepare and consecrate &#8220;all the articles,&#8221; He opens the way for renewed fellowship and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Cast away.</span>--The same word as "cast off" in <a href="/2_chronicles/11-14.htm" title="For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD:">2Chronicles 11:14</a>.
