It reflects the biblical theme of God speaking to chosen leaders, as seen with figures like Moses and David. This divine interaction underscores the importance of Solomon's role in Israel's history.<p><b>Since this was in your heart</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. Solomon's request reveals his genuine desire to lead wisely, aligning with God's values. This reflects the biblical principle that God values the intentions of the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>instead of requesting riches or wealth or honor for yourself</b><br>This phrase contrasts Solomon's request with common human desires for material gain and personal glory. It highlights the biblical teaching that true wisdom and leadership prioritize the well-being of others over self-interest. This aligns with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He emphasizes serving others over seeking personal gain (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<p><b>or death for your enemies</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings often sought the defeat of their enemies to secure their reign. Solomon's choice not to ask for this reflects a departure from typical royal priorities, emphasizing peace and wisdom over conflict. This foreshadows the peaceful reign of Christ, the Prince of Peace, who conquers not through violence but through love and sacrifice.<p><b>and since you have not even requested long life</b><br>Long life was considered a blessing and a sign of God's favor in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). Solomon's decision not to ask for this indicates his focus on the immediate need for wisdom to govern effectively. This reflects the biblical theme that spiritual and moral priorities should take precedence over personal longevity.<p><b>but have asked for wisdom and knowledge</b><br>Solomon's request for wisdom and knowledge is central to his legacy and is celebrated in biblical literature, particularly in the Book of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Wisdom in the Bible is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is considered more valuable than riches (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-15</a>). This request aligns with the biblical portrayal of Jesus as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<p><b>to govern My people</b><br>This phrase underscores Solomon's role as a servant leader, responsible for the well-being of God's chosen people, Israel. It reflects the biblical principle that leaders are stewards of God's people, accountable to Him for their governance. This is echoed in the New Testament, where church leaders are called to shepherd God's flock (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>).<p><b>over whom I have made you king</b><br>This emphasizes God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, a recurring theme in the Bible. Solomon's kingship is portrayed as part of God's divine plan, similar to how God anointed David. This foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is appointed by God to reign over all creation (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem. He is the central figure in this passage, having just become king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity of Israel, who appears to Solomon in a dream and offers him anything he desires. God's response to Solomon's request highlights His approval of Solomon's priorities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigns. The context of Solomon's request is his desire to govern this people wisely.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>The place where Solomon offered sacrifices and where God appeared to him in a dream. It was a significant high place before the Temple was built in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_knowledge.htm">Wisdom and Knowledge</a></b><br>The qualities Solomon requests from God, which are central to his ability to govern effectively. These are contrasted with more typical royal desires like wealth or power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_godly_wisdom.htm">Prioritizing Godly Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's request for wisdom over wealth or power demonstrates the importance of prioritizing spiritual discernment and understanding in leadership and personal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/aligning_desires_with_god's_will.htm">Aligning Desires with God's Will</a></b><br>Solomon's heart was aligned with God's purposes, showing that when our desires match God's will, He is pleased to grant them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_selfless_leadership.htm">The Value of Selfless Leadership</a></b><br>Solomon's request was not for personal gain but for the benefit of his people, illustrating the biblical principle of servant leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_generosity_in_response_to_righteous_requests.htm">God's Generosity in Response to Righteous Requests</a></b><br>God's response to Solomon shows His willingness to bless those who seek His wisdom and prioritize His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_a_heart_for_god.htm">The Impact of a Heart for God</a></b><br>Solomon's heart for God set the foundation for his reign, reminding us that our inner motivations significantly impact our external actions and legacy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_1_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 1:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_prioritize_wisdom_over_wealth_2.htm">Why did God prioritize wisdom over wealth and power in 2 Chronicles 1:11?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Seek_wisdom_like_Solomon_daily.htm">How can we seek wisdom like Solomon in our daily decisions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Solomon_s_request_heart_priorities.htm">What does Solomon's request reveal about his heart and priorities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/James_1_5_and_Solomon_s_wisdom_request_3.htm">How does James 1:5 relate to Solomon's request for wisdom?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_Solomon_s_example_in_prayer.htm">How can we apply Solomon's example to our prayer life today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_prioritize_wisdom_over_wealth_5.htm">Why did God prioritize wisdom over wealth in 2 Chronicles 1:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Solomon_s_wisdom_request_show.htm">How does Solomon's request for wisdom reflect his character and priorities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_1_11_God_s_vs_human_values.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 1:11 teach about God's values versus human values?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_1_chr_11_and_2_sam_23_lists_differ.htm">Why does the list of David's mighty men in 1 Chronicles 11 differ from similar lists in other biblical passages like 2 Samuel 23, and can both be historically accurate?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_highlight_solomon's_grandeur_here.htm">2 Chronicles 1 &#8211; Why does this passage emphasize Solomon&#8217;s grandeur when other records of his reign mention serious moral and political failures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/proof_solomon's_wisdom_wealth_true.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10 - Is there historical or archeological proof that Solomon's wisdom and wealth matched the biblical account?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_wisdom_futile_in_ecclesiastes_2_15-16.htm">Does Ecclesiastes 2:15-16 contradict Proverbs' exaltation of wisdom by calling wisdom ultimately futile?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Chronicles 1:11 Mean</div><b>God said to Solomon</b><p>God personally addresses the young king, underscoring both His sovereignty and His nearness.

Scripture presents this as a literal conversation&#8212;reminding us that our God is a communicating God who initiates relationship and reveals His will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since this was in your heart</b><p>The Lord begins by noting what lies inside Solomon, because &#8220;man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; God searches motives (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-21.htm">Psalm 44:21</a>)<p>&#8226; A pure heart guides wise choices (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>)<p>Solomon&#8217;s request flows from an inner desire that pleases God, demonstrating that genuine faith starts within before it is voiced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead of requesting riches or wealth or honor for yourself</b><p>Most rulers crave treasure, status, and acclaim, yet Solomon did not pursue them.

It also mirrors the warnings against loving money (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>) and exalts the superior value of wisdom over gold (<a href="/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or death for your enemies</b><p>Vengeance was a common royal ambition, especially for a son of David who had fought many foes.

Like David before him who &#8220;shepherded them&#8230; with skillful hands&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-72</a>), Solomon seeks the tools to lead well.

It is here concisely given in two verses, but occupies five (vers. 10-14) in the parallel place, including the verse not found here, which says, "The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing." Otherwise there is no essential difference of any importance, though it may be noted that the parallel gives voice to the promise of "length of days," on the condition of Solomon fulfilling his part in showing obedience to the Divine will, and in following the steps of his father. <span class="cmt_word">Riches, wealth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The most elementary idea of the former of these two words seems to be "straight growth," "prosperity;" of the latter, "to gather together" or "heap up." The former is found first in <a href="/genesis/31-16.htm">Genesis 31:16</a>; and in the verb (hiph. conjugation) in <a href="/genesis/14-23.htm">Genesis 14:23</a>. Afterwards it is found in almost all of the historical books, in the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and in the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel. The latter word occurs only five times (<a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>; in this and the following verses; and in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>). Its Chaldee form is also found in <a href="/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a> and Ezra 7:26. A comparison of these passages scarcely sustains the supposition of some, suggested by the derivation of the word, that it marks specially those stores of useful things which constituted largely the wealth of Old Testament times. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom and knowledge</span>. The distinction between these is evident, as also that they are needful complements of one another for the forming of a catholic, useful, sound character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;
