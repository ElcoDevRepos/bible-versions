Jehoiada, the high priest, had been instrumental in preserving Joash's life and establishing him as king (2 Chronicles 23). This act of ingratitude is a recurring theme in Scripture, where leaders forget the divine and human assistance they received (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>). The kindness Jehoiada extended can be seen as a type of God's grace, which is often forgotten by those who turn away from Him.<p><b>Instead, Joash killed Jehoiada&#8217;s son.</b><br>This act of violence against Zechariah, Jehoiada's son, marks a stark betrayal and a departure from the covenantal faithfulness expected of a king in Israel. The murder of a prophet, especially one who was the son of his benefactor, underscores Joash's moral decline and the influence of idolatrous practices that had crept into Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-18</a>). This event foreshadows the rejection and persecution of prophets throughout Israel's history, culminating in the rejection of Jesus Christ, the ultimate prophet (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>As he lay dying, Zechariah said, &#8220;May the LORD see this and call you to account.&#8221;</b><br>Zechariah's dying words serve as both a prophetic declaration and a call for divine justice. In the biblical narrative, God is often portrayed as the ultimate judge who sees all actions and holds individuals accountable (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). This plea for divine retribution is echoed in the Psalms and the prophetic literature, where the righteous call upon God to vindicate them (<a href="/psalms/7-9.htm">Psalm 7:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>). Zechariah's words also prefigure the New Testament theme of divine judgment and accountability, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>The high priest who played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash and guiding him in his early reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The son of Jehoiada, a prophet who was killed by Joash for speaking against the king's apostasy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where these events took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem, which Joash initially helped to restore.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_influence.htm">The Importance of Godly Influence</a></b><br>Jehoiada's influence on Joash shows the impact of godly mentorship.

Contrast the prayer of St. Stephen, the first of Christian martyrs (<a href="/acts/7-50.htm" title="Has not my hand made all these things?">Acts 7:50</a>). The prayer of Zechariah was also a prophecy destined to speedy fulfilment. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.">2Chronicles 24:23</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembered not the kindness</span> (<a href="/genesis/40-23.htm">Genesis 40:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord look upon it, and require it</span>. So, too, the Revised Version, which also, according to its custom, removes the italic type from the two neuter pronouns "it." But probabaly a better and correcter rendering is, "The Lord will see and will require" (for it is not necessary to regard this as a prayer of Zechariah); and thus bring it into comparison with those divinest prayers of the Saviour and of St. Stephen. The words on dying Zechariah's lips were perhaps rather the vivid reminiscence of his own well-versed knowledge of the Law, or "the Scriptures" (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>). The sentence of the dying priest and prophet in one, is, by the writer of Chronicles at any rate, directed in its fall with fearful straightness to the door of <span class="cmt_word">Joash the king</span> himself. Remarkable as is the absence of the matter of this and the five preceding verses from the parallel, it will not escape notice how it is implied in vers. 17,18 there, while the <span class="accented">inclusion</span> of it here is again in patent harmony with the great object of the writer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
