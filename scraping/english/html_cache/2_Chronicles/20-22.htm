In the biblical context, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, had appointed singers to lead the army with songs of praise to God. This act of faith demonstrates the belief that God inhabits the praises of His people (<a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>). The immediate response from God upon their worship underscores the principle that spiritual victories often begin with worship and reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength.<p><b>the LORD set ambushes</b><br>The ambushes set by the LORD indicate divine intervention in the battle. This reflects the biblical theme that God fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>). The term "ambushes" suggests a sudden and unexpected attack, which in this context, was orchestrated by God Himself. This divine strategy is reminiscent of other instances in Scripture where God confounds the enemies of Israel, such as the confusion of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea.<p><b>against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir</b><br>These groups were long-standing adversaries of Israel and Judah. The Ammonites and Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>), while the people of Mount Seir were Edomites, descendants of Esau (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). Historically, these nations often opposed Israel, and their coalition against Judah in this passage represents a significant threat. The geographical regions of Ammon, Moab, and Edom (Mount Seir) are located east and southeast of the Dead Sea, highlighting the strategic and political challenges faced by Judah.<p><b>who had come against Judah</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, was often under threat from surrounding nations. This phrase emphasizes the imminent danger faced by Jehoshaphat and his people. The historical context reveals that Judah was a smaller kingdom compared to its neighbors, making divine intervention crucial for its survival. The coalition of these three nations against Judah signifies a formidable alliance, yet it also sets the stage for God to demonstrate His power and faithfulness to His covenant people.<p><b>and they were defeated</b><br>The defeat of the coalition is a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This outcome fulfills the prophetic assurance given to Jehoshaphat that he would not need to fight in this battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>). The victory without physical combat serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, achieved not through human effort but through divine power. This event also parallels other biblical victories where God delivers His people in miraculous ways, reinforcing the theme of trust and reliance on God for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led the nation in seeking the Lord's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing a coalition of enemies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammon,_moab,_and_mount_seir.htm">Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir</a></b><br>The nations that formed an alliance to attack Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervened on behalf of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ambushes.htm">Ambushes</a></b><br>The divine intervention that led to the defeat of Judah's enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_praise.htm">The Power of Praise</a></b><br>Praise is not just a response to victory but a catalyst for it.
