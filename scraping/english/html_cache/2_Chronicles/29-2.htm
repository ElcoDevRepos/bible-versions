In the biblical context, doing what is "right in the eyes of the LORD" signifies adherence to God's commandments and a commitment to worship Him alone. This is a recurring theme in the books of Kings and Chronicles, where the kings of Israel and Judah are often judged based on their faithfulness to God. Hezekiah's actions are contrasted with those of many of his predecessors, who led the people into idolatry. His reforms, including the restoration of temple worship and the destruction of pagan altars, reflect his dedication to aligning Judah with God's will. This phrase underscores the importance of divine approval over human opinion.<p><b>just as his father David had done</b><br>David is frequently used as the benchmark for righteous kingship in the Old Testament. Although Hezekiah was not a direct son of David, the term "father" is used here to denote a forefather or ancestor, emphasizing the dynastic lineage of the Davidic covenant. David's reign is characterized by his heart for God, despite his personal failings. Hezekiah's comparison to David suggests a return to the ideals of a theocratic monarchy, where the king leads the nation in covenant faithfulness. This connection also points to the messianic hope rooted in the Davidic line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" in the New Testament. Hezekiah's reforms and faithfulness serve as a type of Christ, prefiguring the ultimate restoration and perfect kingship found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore proper worship of Yahweh.
