High places were elevated sites often used for worship, typically of pagan gods. These sites were contrary to the worship of Yahweh, which was centralized in the temple in Jerusalem. The building of high places signified a departure from exclusive worship of the God of Israel and a return to Canaanite religious practices. This act of building high places was a direct violation of God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, where the Israelites were instructed to destroy such places. The hills of Judah, being prominent and visible, were strategic locations for these high places, making the idolatrous practices more accessible and widespread.<p><b>he had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves</b><br>The term "prostitute themselves" is often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness or idolatry. In this context, it indicates that Jehoram led the people into spiritual adultery by encouraging the worship of foreign gods. This language echoes the prophetic imagery found in books like Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital unfaithfulness. The people of Jerusalem, the city chosen by God for His temple, were led into practices that were abominable in the sight of God, reflecting a deep spiritual decline. This spiritual prostitution was not just a personal sin of Jehoram but had communal implications, affecting the entire population.<p><b>and had led Judah astray.</b><br>Jehoram's leadership had a profound impact on the spiritual direction of the nation. By leading Judah astray, he not only influenced the religious practices but also the moral and ethical standards of the people. This phrase highlights the responsibility of leaders to guide their people in righteousness. The consequences of leading Judah astray were severe, as seen in the subsequent judgment that came upon the nation. This act of leading astray is reminiscent of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> about false prophets and leaders who entice the people to follow other gods. Jehoram's actions set a precedent for future kings and contributed to the eventual downfall of Judah, as the nation continued to struggle with idolatry and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Jehoshaphat, who led the nation into idolatry and away from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites often used for idol worship, contrary to the worship of Yahweh, which was to be centralized in the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, over which Jehoram reigned.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple of Yahweh was located, yet Jehoram led its people into idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The worship of idols or false gods, which was a direct violation of the first commandment and a recurring issue for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of their people.

God warned, &#8220;Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land&#8230; lest you prostitute yourselves by following their gods&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By leading the capital city into pagan rites, Jehoram encouraged the very unfaithfulness Hosea later condemned: &#8220;They consult their wooden idols&#8230; therefore the people without understanding are doomed&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The connection between sexual immorality and idol worship is direct; pagan rituals frequently involved literal immorality (<a href="/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; When leaders normalize sin, the people follow.

Jehoram decisively chose the latter path.<p>&#8226; The result was divine judgment: within the same chapter the Lord &#8220;aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and Arabs&#8221; and struck him with a terminal disease (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later underscored the seriousness of causing others to stumble: &#8220;It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>).
