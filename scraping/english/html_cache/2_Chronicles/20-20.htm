The Wilderness of Tekoa is located near the town of Tekoa, about 12 miles south of Jerusalem. This area is known for its rugged terrain and sparse vegetation, which would have been a strategic location for military movements. Tekoa is also the hometown of the prophet Amos, linking this location to prophetic significance. The early departure signifies readiness and trust in God's guidance.<p><b>As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood up and said,</b><br>Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, demonstrates leadership by addressing the people directly. His action of standing up symbolizes authority and the importance of the message he is about to deliver. This moment is pivotal as it sets the tone for the spiritual and military strategy that follows. Jehoshaphat's leadership is characterized by reliance on God, contrasting with other kings who depended on military alliances.<p><b>&#8220;Hear me, O people of Judah and Jerusalem.</b><br>The call to "hear" is a common biblical exhortation, emphasizing the importance of listening to God's word. Judah and Jerusalem represent the southern kingdom, highlighting the unity and collective responsibility of the people. This appeal is reminiscent of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where hearing is linked to obedience and faithfulness to God.<p><b>Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be upheld;</b><br>The exhortation to "believe" underscores faith as the foundation for divine support and stability. The phrase "you will be upheld" suggests that faith in God provides strength and security, echoing themes found in Psalms and Proverbs. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on God's promises and character.<p><b>believe in His prophets, and you will succeed.&#8221;</b><br>The reference to "His prophets" highlights the role of prophetic revelation in guiding the people. Prophets were God's messengers, and their words were to be trusted as divine communication. Success is linked to obedience to prophetic instruction, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and Elijah. This statement foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on faith in Christ, the ultimate prophet and fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who led the people in seeking God's guidance and deliverance from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_judah_and_jerusalem.htm">People of Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the southern kingdom who were facing a coalition of enemy forces.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_tekoa.htm">Wilderness of Tekoa</a></b><br>The location where the people of Judah gathered to confront their enemies, symbolizing a place of testing and faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>God's messengers who conveyed His will and guidance to the people, emphasizing the importance of divine revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemies.htm">The Enemies</a></b><br>The Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites who threatened Judah, representing challenges and adversities in life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Faith in God&#8217;s Sovereignty</a></b><br>Trusting in God's power and plan is essential for overcoming life's challenges.

Like <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, where David seeks the LORD &#8220;in the morning,&#8221; Judah rises promptly because trust in God does not procrastinate. The wilderness setting underlines vulnerability&#8212;recall how God called Israel into the desert in <a href="/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a> to show He alone sustains. Tekoa itself was a ridge overlooking enemy territory (2 Chron 20:2), so heading there is an act of faith, not retreat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As they set out</b><p>Faith never stays theoretical. When God gives direction, His people move (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>, &#8220;Tell the Israelites to go forward&#8221;). <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> reminds us that faith without action is dead. Each step toward Tekoa says, &#8220;We believe God will fight for us&#8221; (2 Chron 20:17). Moving before seeing the victory models the walk of faith urged in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;we walk by faith, not by sight.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat stood up and said, &#8220;Hear me, O people of Judah and Jerusalem</b><p>A godly leader stands to anchor the people&#8217;s hearts in truth, echoing Moses&#8217; &#8220;Hear, O Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>). Jehoshaphat doesn&#8217;t offer strategy first; he calls for attention to God&#8217;s word. <a href="/proverbs/29-18.htm">Proverbs 29:18</a> warns that without revelation people cast off restraint, so the king gathers them around revelation before battle. His posture&#8212;standing&#8212;conveys resolve reminiscent of <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be upheld;</b><p>&#8220;Believe&#8221; here is not vague optimism; it is settled trust in the covenant-keeping LORD. <a href="/isaiah/7-9.htm">Isaiah 7:9</a> frames it bluntly: &#8220;If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.&#8221; The promise &#8220;you will be upheld&#8221; mirrors <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.&#8221; Secure footing comes from relying on His character, not circumstances.

Jesus rebuked two disciples for being &#8220;slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>). Today, Scripture carries that prophetic authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>).
