The carved image likely represents an idol associated with Canaanite or Assyrian deities, reflecting the syncretism prevalent during his reign. This act signifies a deep spiritual decline, as Manasseh led Judah into practices that were abominable to God (<a href="/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11</a>).<p><b>and set it up in the house of God</b><br>The house of God refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites. By placing an idol in the temple, Manasseh desecrated the sacred space dedicated to Yahweh. This act of defilement is reminiscent of the abominations committed by the nations that God had driven out before Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>).<p><b>of which God had said to David and his son Solomon</b><br>God's promise to David and Solomon emphasized the temple's significance as a dwelling place for His Name (<a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16-20</a>). This covenantal promise underscored the temple's role as a symbol of God's presence and favor with Israel. Manasseh's actions directly contradicted the divine instructions given to his forefathers.<p><b>&#8220;In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel</b><br>Jerusalem was chosen by God as the spiritual and political center of Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). The selection of Jerusalem and the temple as His dwelling place highlights God's sovereign choice and the city's unique status among the tribes. This choice is reiterated throughout the Old Testament, emphasizing the city's importance in God's redemptive plan (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>).<p><b>I will establish My Name forever.&#8221;</b><br>The establishment of God's Name forever signifies His eternal covenant with Israel and His enduring presence among His people (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). This promise points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence and reigns eternally (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). Manasseh's idolatry stands in stark contrast to this divine promise, highlighting the tension between human rebellion and God's faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, son of Hezekiah, known for his idolatry and leading Judah into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_god.htm">House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where God's presence dwelt among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, to whom God promised an everlasting dynasty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Son of David, known for his wisdom and for building the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The chosen city where God established His Name and where the Temple was built.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a direct violation of God's commandments and leads to spiritual decay.

Earlier kings flirted with idolatry outside Jerusalem, but Manasseh personally crafted an idol&#8212;an intentional, calculated rebellion.<p>&#8226; Cross-references amplify the gravity: <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> condemns carved images; <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a> forbids setting up &#8220;a carved image or a sacred pillar&#8221; anywhere in Israel, let alone in the heart of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set it up in the house of God</b><p>&#8226; The idol is not merely tolerated; it is enthroned &#8220;in the house of God.&#8221; This desecrates the very place where God&#8217;s glory had once filled the sanctuary (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By planting an idol inside the Temple, Manasseh mixed paganism with true worship&#8212;precisely what <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3-4</a> warned against.<p>&#8226; The act parallels <a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3-6</a>, where an idol of jealousy in the Temple provokes the Lord.<p>&#8226; Such defilement foreshadows the exile: 2 Chron 36:14-17 links Temple pollution with the Babylonian destruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of which God had said to David and his son Solomon</b><p>&#8226; The chronicler immediately recalls God&#8217;s covenantal promises to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) and Solomon (1 Chron 28:6).<p>&#8226; Their obedience led to the Temple&#8217;s construction (<a href="/1_kings/8-18.htm">1 Kings 8:18-20</a>). Manasseh&#8217;s conduct stands as the antithesis of their faithfulness.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores accountability: the same God who spoke promise also enforces discipline (2 Chron 7:17-20).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s choice of Jerusalem is unique (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). The city and Temple are meant as the visible center of covenant worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By bringing an idol into that chosen site, Manasseh insults the divine election itself&#8212;declaring that another deity is worthy of equal or greater honor.<p>&#8226; The chronicler&#8217;s readers, returning from exile, would feel the weight: fidelity to God&#8217;s chosen place matters for their restoration (<a href="/ezra/6-12.htm">Ezra 6:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will establish My Name forever.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;My Name&#8221; represents God&#8217;s revealed character and presence (<a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise of permanence (&#8220;forever&#8221;) is conditional on covenant obedience (<a href="/1_kings/9-6.htm">1 Kings 9:6-9</a>). Manasseh&#8217;s idolatry threatens to cut Israel off from the very security God gave.<p>&#8226; Yet the covenant mercy endures: after exile, God&#8217;s Name is re-honored in the rebuilt Temple (<a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>), and ultimately in Christ, in whom &#8220;all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/33-7.htm">2 Chronicles 33:7</a> reveals the depth of Manasseh&#8217;s rebellion: he physically plants a handmade idol in the sanctuary God had uniquely chosen for His own Name. This act desecrates the Temple, violates direct commands, spurns the covenant with David and Solomon, and jeopardizes the permanence of God&#8217;s presence among His people. The verse serves as a sober warning: idolatry, especially in the heart of worship, invites judgment, yet God&#8217;s covenant promises remain ready to be renewed when His people repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he set</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span> <span class= "bld">had made.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he set the carven image of the idol which he had made.
