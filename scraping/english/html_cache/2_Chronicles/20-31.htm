His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to strengthen the kingdom spiritually and militarily. Judah, the southern kingdom, was distinct from the northern kingdom of Israel, and Jehoshaphat's rule was marked by a desire to follow the ways of the Lord, contrasting with the often idolatrous practices in Israel. His reign is documented in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/17.htm">2 Chronicles 17-20</a>, highlighting his commitment to God and his attempts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>He was thirty-five years old when he became king,</b><br>Jehoshaphat's age at the beginning of his reign suggests a level of maturity and experience, likely gained during his father Asa's reign. This age indicates that he was well-prepared to assume leadership, having observed and learned from Asa's successes and failures. The age of thirty-five also implies that he had a significant portion of his life to influence the kingdom positively.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years.</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the political and spiritual center of the kingdom. Jehoshaphat's 25-year reign allowed him to implement long-term reforms and establish stability. His reign included efforts to fortify the city and enhance its defenses, as well as to promote the worship of Yahweh. The duration of his reign provided a period of relative peace and prosperity, allowing for the consolidation of his policies and the strengthening of Judah's position among neighboring nations.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</b><br>The mention of Jehoshaphat's mother, Azubah, highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative. While not much is known about Azubah or Shilhi, the inclusion of her name suggests her significance in Jehoshaphat's life and possibly her influence on his spiritual upbringing. In the biblical context, mothers often played crucial roles in the religious and moral education of their children, which may have contributed to Jehoshaphat's dedication to following the ways of the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is noted for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord, strengthen the kingdom, and seek God&#8217;s guidance in times of trouble.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Jehoshaphat reigned.

The verse opens by restating the fact of Jehoshaphat&#8217;s kingship, reminding us that leadership is granted&#8212;and evaluated&#8212;by God (see <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming immediately after the dramatic victory in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22&#8211;30</a>, the line underlines that God not only delivers His people but also sustains the ruler who trusts Him (compare <a href="/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s throne remained in the Davidic line, fulfilling promises like <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>: &#8220;Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God-honoring leadership brings stability to God&#8217;s people (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was thirty-five years old when he became king.</b><p>&#8226; At thirty-five, Jehoshaphat was mature enough to rule yet young enough to lead energetically.<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes a ruler&#8217;s age to highlight God&#8217;s timing:<p>&#8211; David: &#8220;David was thirty years old when he became king&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Uzziah: sixteen (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Josiah: eight (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-1.htm">2 Chronicles 34:1</a>).<p>&#8226; These contrasts show God equips different servants at different stages; obedience matters more than age (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s early years likely prepared him for the reforms recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7&#8211;9</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years.</b><p>&#8226; A twenty-five-year reign signals relative peace and divine favor (compare <a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Key moments during those years:<p>&#8211; Spiritual reforms and nationwide teaching of the Law (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8211; Misstep in allying with Ahab, yet repentance followed (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; The famed prayer and victory over the Moabite-Ammonite coalition (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Long reigns often allow either entrenched sin or sustained righteousness; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s record shows how quickly blessing follows humility (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jerusalem remains the covenant center (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1&#8211;3</a>), prefiguring the Messianic Kingship of Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.</b><p>&#8226; Mentioning the queen mother was standard (<a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>), underscoring her influence in the royal household.<p>&#8226; God honors the role of mothers in shaping future leaders (<a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Azubah&#8217;s name surfaces only here and in <a href="/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>, yet her inclusion speaks to God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping of family lines (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference reminds readers that personal faithfulness often starts within the family circle (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-31.htm">2 Chronicles 20:31</a> is more than a historical footnote; it anchors Jehoshaphat&#8217;s story in concrete details that testify to God&#8217;s sovereign hand. His divinely granted throne, timely installation at thirty-five, sustained twenty-five-year reign, and godly family background all weave together to show that righteous leadership, grounded in personal and familial faithfulness, invites God&#8217;s enduring blessing on His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">CONCLUDING NOTICES.
