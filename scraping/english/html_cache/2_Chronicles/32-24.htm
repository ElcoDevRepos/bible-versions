The phrase "in those days" refers to a period during his reign when he faced significant challenges, including the Assyrian threat. His illness is described as "mortal," indicating it was life-threatening. This event is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20:1-11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38:1-8</a>, providing a fuller picture of the circumstances. The cultural context of the time viewed illness as a potential sign of divine displeasure, which may have added to the gravity of Hezekiah's situation.<p><b>So he prayed to the LORD,</b><br>Hezekiah's response to his illness was to turn to God in prayer, demonstrating his reliance on divine intervention. This act of prayer is consistent with his character as a king who sought the Lord's guidance and help, as seen in his previous actions against idolatry and his reforms. Prayer was a central aspect of Hebrew worship and communication with God, reflecting a deep personal relationship and trust in God's power to heal and deliver.<p><b>who spoke to him</b><br>God's response to Hezekiah's prayer was direct and personal, indicating a close relationship between the king and the divine. This communication likely came through the prophet Isaiah, as detailed in the parallel accounts. The idea of God speaking to individuals is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing His willingness to engage with His people and provide guidance, comfort, and instruction.<p><b>and gave him a sign.</b><br>The sign given to Hezekiah was the miraculous turning back of the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz, as described in <a href="/2_kings/20-8.htm">2 Kings 20:8-11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>. This sign served as a confirmation of God's promise to heal Hezekiah and extend his life by fifteen years. Signs and wonders in the Bible often serve to authenticate God's message and His messengers, reinforcing faith and trust in His promises. This event also prefigures the miraculous signs associated with Jesus Christ, who performed miracles to validate His divine authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in the kingdom.
