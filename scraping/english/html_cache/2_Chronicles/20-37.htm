Mareshah was a city in the lowlands of Judah, known for its strategic location and historical significance. Prophets often emerged from various regions, emphasizing that God's messages were not confined to a single place. Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, was generally a righteous ruler, but this prophecy highlights a moment of divine correction.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah</b><br>Jehoshaphat's alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, is significant because Ahaziah was known for his wickedness, following in the idolatrous ways of his father Ahab. This alliance was politically motivated, aiming to strengthen economic and military ties, but it was spiritually compromising. The Bible frequently warns against forming alliances with those who do not honor God, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, which advises against being unequally yoked with unbelievers.<p><b>the LORD has destroyed your works.&#8221;</b><br>The destruction of Jehoshaphat's works serves as a divine judgment and a reminder of God's sovereignty. It underscores the biblical principle that disobedience and unholy alliances lead to negative consequences. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which states that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. God's intervention here is a corrective measure to realign Jehoshaphat with His will.<p><b>So the ships were wrecked and were unable to sail to Tarshish.</b><br>The ships, intended for a joint venture to Tarshish, a distant and wealthy trading destination, symbolize the failed economic ambitions of the alliance. Tarshish is often associated with wealth and trade, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>. The wrecking of the ships serves as a tangible manifestation of God's judgment, illustrating the futility of plans made outside of His guidance.

His hometown, Mareshah in Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>), roots him among the king&#8217;s own people, underscoring that this warning is loving family correction rather than foreign hostility (cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>). When God raises such a voice, He is keeping His promise never to leave His people without clear counsel (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; 2 Chron 24:19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prophesied against Jehoshaphat</b><p>Jehoshaphat had walked faithfully by instituting national reforms and seeking the Lord (2 Chron 17:3-6), yet he had a recurring blind spot: unwise alliances. After surviving his earlier partnership with Ahab (2 Chron 18:31), he received a stern rebuke from Jehu the seer: &#8220;Should you help the wicked?&#8221; (2 Chron 19:2). Sadly, Jehoshaphat repeats the pattern by joining Ahaziah, Ahab&#8217;s son (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48-49</a>). God&#8217;s patience is long, but His warnings demand obedience (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah"</b><p>Ahaziah &#8220;acted wickedly&#8221; (2 Chron 20:35), continuing the idolatrous legacy of his father (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52-53</a>). By linking arms with him, Jehoshaphat risked normalizing sin and compromising Judah&#8217;s witness (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>). The Lord draws a bright line: political expediency can never override covenant loyalty. Earlier, Asa lost victory for leaning on Aram instead of God (2 Chron 16:7-9). History repeats itself when lessons go unheeded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"The LORD has destroyed your works"</b><p>God Himself intervenes, not merely allowing setbacks but actively &#8220;destroying&#8221; the project. <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain.&#8221; The wording leaves no doubt about authorship of the calamity: divine discipline aimed at restoring single-hearted devotion (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>). The collapse of a business venture may feel purely economic, yet here it is unmistakably spiritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the ships were wrecked and were unable to sail to Tarshish</b><p>The fleet, constructed at Ezion-Geber on the Red Sea to reach lucrative Tarshish markets (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), never clears the harbor (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Instead of gold and exotic goods, Judah receives splintered hulls&#8212;a vivid parable matching Jonah&#8217;s storm (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>) and Paul&#8217;s shipwreck (<a href="/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21-26</a>): God will ground any voyage that steers away from His will. Jehoshaphat learns that ill-chosen partnerships can sink even the best-built ships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a> teaches that faithful believers must guard against alliances with the ungodly, no matter how profitable they appear. God sent Eliezer to confront Jehoshaphat, highlighting that repeated compromise invites divine intervention. The wrecked fleet stands as a tangible reminder that the Lord protects His people by overturning ventures that threaten their purity and dependence on Him.
