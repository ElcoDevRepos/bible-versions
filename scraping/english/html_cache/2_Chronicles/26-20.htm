The presence of multiple priests indicates the seriousness of the situation. Leprosy, a severe skin disease, was considered a sign of divine judgment and impurity, rendering a person ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>). The forehead, being a prominent and visible part of the body, symbolizes the public nature of Uzziah's sin and its consequences. This event underscores the importance of holiness and obedience to God's commands, especially for those in leadership.<p><b>they rushed him out</b><br>The priests' immediate action to remove Uzziah from the temple highlights the urgency and gravity of maintaining the temple's purity. The temple was the dwelling place of God's presence, and any defilement was intolerable. This reflects the broader biblical principle that sin separates humanity from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). The priests' response also demonstrates their commitment to uphold the law, as outlined in the Torah, which required the exclusion of the unclean from the community (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>).<p><b>Indeed, he himself hurried to get out</b><br>Uzziah's own haste to leave the temple indicates his awareness of the severity of his condition and the divine judgment upon him. This moment of realization can be seen as a turning point, where Uzziah acknowledges his transgression against God's holiness. It serves as a reminder of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Uzziah's reaction also parallels the broader biblical theme of repentance and the need for individuals to recognize their sinfulness before a holy God.<p><b>because the LORD had afflicted him</b><br>The affliction of leprosy is explicitly attributed to the LORD, emphasizing God's sovereignty and justice. This divine intervention serves as a warning against pride and presumption, as Uzziah had unlawfully entered the temple to burn incense, a role reserved for the priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-19</a>). The affliction is a direct consequence of Uzziah's disobedience, illustrating the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who bore the afflictions of humanity to restore the broken relationship between God and man (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_the_chief_priest.htm">Azariah the Chief Priest</a></b><br>Azariah was the leading priest during King Uzziah's reign.

Their turning toward the king signals both shock and resolve to uphold God&#8217;s standards.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And saw his leprous forehead</b><p>&#8226; Leprosy appearing instantly on Uzziah&#8217;s forehead is a public, unmistakable sign of God&#8217;s judgment, reminiscent of Miriam&#8217;s sudden leprosy (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests, trained by <a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1-46</a>, immediately recognize the condition and its implications for temple purity (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They rushed him out</b><p>&#8226; Acting on <a href="/bsb/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>&#8217;s requirements, the priests waste no time.
