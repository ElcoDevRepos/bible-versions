In the biblical context, when a prophet declares "this is what the LORD says," it signifies that the message is not of human origin but is a direct communication from God. This is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, underscoring the role of prophets as God's messengers. It also highlights the seriousness and certainty of the message that follows.<p><b>I am about to bring calamity on this place and on its people:</b><br>The "calamity" refers to impending judgment and disaster. In the historical context, this prophecy is delivered during the reign of King Josiah, a time when Judah was under threat from surrounding nations. The "place" refers to Jerusalem and the broader region of Judah. This warning of calamity is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in Deuteronomy, where disobedience to God's laws would result in national disaster. The phrase underscores the theme of divine retribution for sin and the breaking of the covenant.<p><b>according to all the curses written in the book:</b><br>This refers to the Book of the Law, likely Deuteronomy, which was rediscovered during Josiah's reign. The curses mentioned are those found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which detail the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God's commandments. This rediscovery and reading of the Law led to a national religious reform under Josiah, highlighting the importance of Scripture in guiding the moral and spiritual life of the nation.<p><b>that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah:</b><br>The public reading of the Law in the presence of the king signifies the importance of the king's role in leading the nation in covenant faithfulness. King Josiah's response to the reading was one of repentance and reform, as he sought to align the nation with God's commands. This event underscores the biblical principle that leaders are accountable to God's Word and have a responsibility to lead their people in accordance with it. The reading also serves as a reminder of the power of Scripture to convict and inspire change.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgment through prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/huldah_the_prophetess.htm">Huldah the Prophetess</a></b><br>The prophetess who delivered God's message of impending judgment to King Josiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing divine judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_the_law.htm">The Book of the Law</a></b><br>The rediscovered scroll, likely Deuteronomy, which contained the covenantal curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_god's_word.htm">The Importance of God's Word</a></b><br>The rediscovery of the Book of the Law underscores the necessity of Scripture in guiding personal and communal life.
