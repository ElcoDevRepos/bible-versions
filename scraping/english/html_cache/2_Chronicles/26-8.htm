Tribute indicates a form of submission or acknowledgment of Uzziah's power. This act of bringing tribute suggests a period of peace or subjugation, reflecting Uzziah's strong military and political influence. Historically, tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, serving as a means to maintain alliances or avoid conflict. This tribute signifies Uzziah's dominance and the stability of his reign.<p><b>and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt</b><br>Uzziah's fame reaching the border of Egypt highlights the extent of his influence. Egypt, a significant power in the region, often served as a benchmark for the reach of a king's reputation. This phrase suggests that Uzziah's accomplishments, possibly including military victories, economic prosperity, and architectural achievements, were well-known beyond Israel. The mention of Egypt also connects to the broader biblical narrative, where Egypt frequently appears as a symbol of worldly power and influence.<p><b>for he had become exceedingly powerful</b><br>Uzziah's power is attributed to his military successes, economic advancements, and infrastructural developments, such as fortifying Jerusalem and expanding agricultural projects. His power is seen as a blessing from God, aligning with the Deuteronomic principle that obedience leads to prosperity. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of divine favor and the responsibilities that come with power. Uzziah's reign is a type of Christ in that it foreshadows the ultimate reign of Jesus, who will have dominion over all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>Also known as Azariah, he was the king of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

Just as David&#8217;s foes &#8220;became subject to him and brought tribute&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), Uzziah now occupies that same position of dominance.<p>&#8226; The verse confirms God&#8217;s covenant promise that Israel would &#8220;lend to many nations but borrow from none&#8221; when walking in obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>). Uzziah&#8217;s earlier pattern of &#8220;seeking God&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>) explains why this blessing arrives now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt</b><p>&#8220;and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt&#8221; (2 Chron 26:8).<p>&#8226; Uzziah&#8217;s reputation races far beyond Judah&#8217;s borders, reaching the southwestern limit of the ancient Near East&#8217;s major powers&#8212;&#8220;the Brook of Egypt&#8221; region (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often measures a king&#8217;s greatness by how far his name travels; Solomon&#8217;s renown drew the Queen of Sheba &#8220;from the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-1.htm">2 Chronicles 9:1</a>). Uzziah now stands in that same line of illustrious rulers.<p>&#8226; Practical outworking: security, expanded trade routes, and diplomatic leverage. Nations at Egypt&#8217;s edge would hear of Judah&#8217;s rise and think twice before hostility&#8212;just as surrounding peoples &#8220;feared&#8221; when they heard of God&#8217;s deeds in Joshua&#8217;s day (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he had become exceedingly powerful</b><p>&#8220;because he had become exceedingly powerful&#8221; (2 Chron 26:8).<p>&#8226; The chronicler points to the underlying cause of both tribute and fame: God-given strength. Earlier we read, &#8220;He was marvelously helped until he became strong&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Power here is military (new weapons, fortified towers&#8212;26:13&#8211;15) and economic (agricultural innovations&#8212;26:10). Both fit the Lord&#8217;s pattern of granting prosperity to those who &#8220;seek first His kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the verse also foreshadows danger. The very next line warns, &#8220;But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall&#8221; (26:16). Cross-linking passages&#8212;Deut 8:17 &#8211; 18; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>&#8212;remind us that strength is a gift to steward humbly, not a license to glorify self.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a> captures a high-water mark of Uzziah&#8217;s reign. Enemy nations submit, distant borders buzz with news of Judah&#8217;s rise, and tangible might undergirds it all&#8212;clear evidence that the Lord faithfully exalts those who depend on Him. The verse encourages us to recognize God as the source of every success, to use influence for His purposes, and to guard our hearts against the pride that too easily follows power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">The Ammonites.</span>--Old enemies of Judab (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm" title="It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.">2Chronicles 20:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Gave gifts.</span>--<span class= "ital">Paid tribute.</span> Literally, <span class= "ital">gave a present,</span> or <span class= "ital">offering</span> (<span class= "ital">minch?h</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">His name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt.</span>--See margin.
