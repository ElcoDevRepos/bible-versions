This phrase indicates a moral and spiritual alignment with God's standards, which is a recurring theme in the evaluation of kings in the books of Kings and Chronicles. Asa's reign is marked by religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, which were considered good and right actions. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-28.htm">Deuteronomy 12:28</a>, which emphasizes obedience to God's commands as the path to doing what is good and right.<p><b>in the eyes of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "in the eyes of the LORD" underscores the divine perspective as the ultimate standard for righteousness. It suggests that Asa's actions were not merely politically or socially motivated but were evaluated based on God's viewpoint. This reflects the biblical principle that true righteousness is determined by God's standards, not human judgment. <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a> states, "Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart," highlighting the importance of divine evaluation.<p><b>his God</b><br>The personal pronoun "his" indicates a personal relationship between Asa and God, suggesting a covenantal bond. This relationship is central to the narrative of the kings of Judah, where the faithfulness of the king to God often determined the nation's prosperity or downfall. Asa's reforms and reliance on God during his reign, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>, demonstrate his commitment to maintaining this relationship. This personal connection to God is a foreshadowing of the New Covenant relationship believers have through Jesus Christ, who enables a personal relationship with God for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the third king of the Kingdom of Judah and the son of Abijah.
