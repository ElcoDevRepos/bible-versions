The chronicler emphasizes the duration of his affliction, highlighting the severity of God's punishment. This period of two years can be seen as a time of reflection and potential repentance, though Jehoram did not turn back to God. The number two in biblical numerology often signifies division or difference, which may symbolize the separation between Jehoram and God's favor.<p><b>Finally, his intestines came out because of his disease,</b><br>The graphic description of Jehoram's death underscores the seriousness of his sin and the fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy against him (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-15</a>). The disease affecting his intestines can be seen as a physical manifestation of the spiritual corruption within him. In the ancient Near East, such a death would be considered particularly shameful, reflecting the disgrace that Jehoram brought upon himself and his kingdom.<p><b>and he died in severe pain.</b><br>The intense suffering Jehoram experienced at the end of his life serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. This phrase emphasizes the physical and spiritual torment that accompanies a life lived in opposition to divine will. The chronicler's account serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of forsaking God's commandments.<p><b>And his people did not make a fire in his honor as they had done for his fathers.</b><br>The absence of a fire in Jehoram's honor signifies the lack of respect and mourning from his people, contrasting with the customary practices for deceased kings. This omission highlights the disapproval of his reign and the alienation he experienced due to his actions. In biblical times, a fire was often used to honor the dead, symbolizing purification and remembrance.
