The "high places" were sites of worship often located on elevated ground. Hezekiah, known for his religious reforms, had destroyed these sites to centralize worship in Jerusalem and eliminate idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). Manasseh's actions represent a reversal of his father's reforms, indicating a return to idolatrous practices. This reflects a broader pattern in Israel's history where kings alternated between faithfulness to Yahweh and idolatry, highlighting the struggle between covenant faithfulness and cultural assimilation.<p><b>and he raised up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles</b><br>The Baals were Canaanite deities associated with fertility and storms, and worship of Baal was a persistent temptation for Israel (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). Asherah poles were wooden symbols representing the goddess Asherah, often placed near altars to Baal. These practices were explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21-22</a>). Manasseh's actions indicate a syncretism, blending the worship of Yahweh with Canaanite religious practices, which was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This syncretism was a significant issue for Israel, leading to prophetic condemnation and eventual judgment.<p><b>And he worshiped and served all the host of heaven</b><br>This phrase indicates the worship of celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, which was common in the ancient Near East. Such practices were condemned in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>) and were seen as a form of idolatry that diverted worship from the Creator to the creation. This type of worship was prevalent in Assyrian and Babylonian cultures, suggesting that Manasseh was influenced by these foreign powers. Theologically, this represents a rejection of Yahweh's sovereignty and a turning to created things for guidance and blessing, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature as a cause for divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Jeremiah 8:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Hezekiah.

Each act deliberately undid Hezekiah&#8217;s reforms and violated explicit commands, showing how quickly a nation can drift when leadership abandons God&#8217;s Word. The verse warns believers to guard against the revival of old idols, stay rooted in Scripture&#8217;s unchanging authority, and reserve worship for the one true God alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span> (See margin.)<p><span class= "bld">Broken down.</span>--<a href="/2_chronicles/23-17.htm" title="Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.">2Chronicles 23:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm" title="Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all.
