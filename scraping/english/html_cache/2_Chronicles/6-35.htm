In the context of Solomon's temple dedication, it reflects the understanding that while God is not confined to the temple, He is attentive to the prayers directed towards it. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>, which speaks of the Lord's throne in heaven, and <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where God declares that heaven is His throne. The phrase underscores the transcendence of God, who is above all creation yet intimately involved with His people.<p><b>their prayer and their plea</b><br>The distinction between "prayer" and "plea" suggests different forms of communication with God. "Prayer" can be seen as a general term for speaking with God, while "plea" indicates a more urgent or desperate request. This reflects the human condition of dependence on divine intervention, especially in times of distress or conflict. The dual mention highlights the sincerity and intensity of the supplicants' requests, reminiscent of the cries for help found throughout the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/86-6.htm">Psalm 86:6-7</a>, where David asks God to listen to his plea for mercy.<p><b>and may You uphold their cause</b><br>This phrase indicates a request for divine justice and support. To "uphold their cause" implies that the people are seeking God's righteous judgment and intervention in their favor. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God as a just judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>, where God maintains the right and the cause of the righteous. It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to defend and vindicate His people when they are faithful to Him. This plea for divine advocacy can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our advocate with the Father (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>), interceding on behalf of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and the builder of the first temple in Jerusalem.

Solomon asks the transcendent God to incline His ear whenever Israel turns toward the temple in faith.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hear the supplication of Your servant&#8230;from Your dwelling place in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-30.htm">1 Kings 8:30</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heavenly vantage means He sees the whole battlefield of life (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-19</a>); nothing escapes His notice.
