Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, had usurped the throne of Judah and led the nation into idolatry. Her removal and the restoration of the rightful Davidic king, Joash, brought relief and celebration. This joy reflects the people's desire for righteous leadership and the restoration of covenantal faithfulness. The rejoicing can be compared to other instances in Scripture where the people celebrate deliverance, such as in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a> after the crossing of the Red Sea. It underscores the theme of God's faithfulness in preserving the Davidic line, which is crucial for the messianic prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, the ultimate King from David's lineage.<p><b>And the city was quiet,</b><br>The quietness of the city signifies a return to peace and order after a period of turmoil and violence under Athaliah's rule. This peace is not just the absence of conflict but a restoration of divine order and justice. In biblical terms, peace (shalom) often indicates completeness and harmony with God's will. The quietness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bring peace to His people when they follow His ways, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. It also foreshadows the peace that Christ, the Prince of Peace, brings to the hearts of believers and ultimately to the world.<p><b>because Athaliah had been put to the sword.</b><br>Athaliah's execution was a necessary act to remove the illegitimate and idolatrous influence from the throne of Judah. Her death marked the end of a dark chapter in Judah's history, characterized by Baal worship and the persecution of the faithful. The phrase "put to the sword" indicates a decisive and final judgment, reflecting the biblical principle that those who lead God's people astray face severe consequences. This act of justice parallels other instances in Scripture where God removes wicked rulers to protect His covenant people, such as the fall of Jezebel in <a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a>. It also serves as a typological foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, ensuring the establishment of His righteous kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah was the queen mother who usurped the throne of Judah after the death of her son, King Ahaziah.

God&#8217;s faithfulness to preserve the Davidic line, honor covenant obedience, and bring justice reminds us that He still replaces turmoil with quiet gladness when His rightful rule is embraced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/23-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
