Solomon, the son of David, was chosen by God to build the Temple, fulfilling the promise made to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The Temple was to be a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and a central place of worship for Israel. This construction signifies a new era of worship and national identity for the Israelites.<p><b>on the second day of the second month</b><br>The timing of the construction is precise, indicating the importance of the event. The second month, known as Ziv in the Hebrew calendar, corresponds to April-May in the Gregorian calendar. This period was likely chosen for favorable weather conditions, allowing for uninterrupted construction. The specificity of the date underscores the organized and deliberate nature of Solomon's reign and the importance of the Temple project.<p><b>in the fourth year of his reign</b><br>Solomon's reign began around 970 BC, making the fourth year approximately 966 BC. This timing aligns with the biblical chronology and provides a historical anchor for the events described. The fourth year of Solomon's reign suggests a period of stability and consolidation of power, allowing him to undertake such a monumental task. This timing also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as Solomon establishes a central place of worship for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom and wealth.

Several manuscripts fail also to show the other words of this clause, viz. "In the second;" and that they are probably spurious derives confirmation from the fact that neither the Arabic nor Syriac Versions, nor the Septuagint nor Vulgate translations, produce them. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the second month, in the fourth year</span>. Reading the verse, therefore, as though it began thus, the most interesting but doubtful question of fixing an exact chronology for what preceded Solomon's reign is opened. In our present text there is little sign of anything to satisfy the offers to do so, if only again to disappoint the more grievously. There we read of "four hundred and eighty years" from the Exodus to this beginning of the building of Solomon's temple. Now, this latter date can be determined with tolerable accuracy (viz. as some twenty years before <span class="date">B.C. 1000</span>) by travelling backwards from the date (n.c. 536) of Cyrus taking Babylon, and the beginning of the return from the Captivity ( <span class="date">B.C. 535</span>), making allowance for the seventy years of the Captivity, the duration of the line of separate Judah-kings, and the <span class="accented">remanet</span>, a large one, of the years of Solomon's reign. All this, however, helps nothing at all the period stretching from the Exodus to the beginning of the building of the temple. And the events of this period, strongly corroborated by other testimony (see Canon Rawlinson, 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. pp. 575, 576), seem to show convincingly that no faith can be reposed in the authenticity of the chronological statement of our parallel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[Solomon] began</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7717;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
