These stands were part of the furnishings Solomon commissioned for the temple, reflecting the grandeur and meticulous design of the temple's construction. The stands were made of bronze, a material often associated with judgment and strength in the Bible. The use of bronze in the temple's construction can be seen as a symbol of God's enduring strength and the judgment that would be executed from His holy place. The detailed craftsmanship of these stands, as described in earlier verses, highlights the importance of beauty and order in worship, reflecting God's own nature.<p><b>the basins on the stands;</b><br>The basins placed on these stands were used for ceremonial washing, an essential part of the temple rituals. These basins, also made of bronze, were used by the priests to cleanse themselves before performing their duties, symbolizing purification and holiness. This practice underscores the necessity of purity when approaching God, a theme consistent throughout Scripture. The basins' presence in the temple points to the need for spiritual cleansing, a concept fulfilled in the New Testament through the sacrificial work of Jesus Christ, who provides ultimate purification for believers. The basins also connect to the laver in the tabernacle, showing continuity in God's requirements for worship and the foreshadowing of Christ's cleansing work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple in Jerusalem.
