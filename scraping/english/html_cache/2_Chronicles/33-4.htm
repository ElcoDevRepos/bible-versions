The house of the LORD, referring to the temple in Jerusalem, was meant to be a place dedicated solely to the worship of Yahweh. By building altars for other gods within the temple, Manasseh desecrated the sacred space. This act reflects the syncretism and idolatry that plagued Judah during his reign. Historically, Manasseh's reign is noted for its apostasy, as he introduced foreign religious practices into the heart of Israelite worship, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>of which the LORD had said, &#8220;My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the significance of Jerusalem as the chosen city where God's presence was to dwell. The LORD's declaration that His Name would remain in Jerusalem forever is rooted in the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his lineage would have an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The temple in Jerusalem was the physical manifestation of God's promise and presence among His people. Manasseh's actions were not only a breach of religious law but also a challenge to the divine promise and order established by God. This phrase also points to the eschatological hope found in the prophetic literature, where Jerusalem is often depicted as the center of God's future kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 55 years and is known for his idolatrous practices, including building altars to foreign gods in the temple of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites and where God's presence was said to dwell.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city chosen by God to place His Name and the location of the temple, representing the spiritual and political center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who had established His Name and presence in Jerusalem and commanded exclusive worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars.htm">Altars</a></b><br>Structures built for the purpose of offering sacrifices, which in this context were erected for idolatrous worship within the temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_worship.htm">The Sanctity of Worship</a></b><br>The temple was a sacred space dedicated to the worship of Yahweh alone.
