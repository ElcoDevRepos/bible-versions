This rejoicing was a response to the successful observance of the Passover, a significant event that had not been celebrated in such a manner for a long time. The joy expressed here is indicative of a spiritual revival and renewal among the people, as they returned to the worship of Yahweh with sincerity and enthusiasm.<p><b>along with the priests and Levites</b><br>The priests and Levites were the religious leaders responsible for conducting the temple services and rituals. Their participation in the rejoicing highlights their role in leading the people back to proper worship. This unity between the religious leaders and the people underscores the importance of spiritual leadership in guiding the nation back to faithfulness. The Levites, in particular, were tasked with teaching the Law and ensuring that the worship was conducted according to God's commandments.<p><b>and the whole assembly that had come from Israel</b><br>This phrase indicates the inclusion of people from the northern kingdom of Israel, which had been separated from Judah since the division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. The presence of Israelites from the north signifies a moment of unity and reconciliation between the divided kingdoms. It reflects King Hezekiah's efforts to invite all of Israel to return to the worship of the true God, as seen in his letters sent throughout Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30:1-9</a>).<p><b>including the foreigners who had come from Israel</b><br>The mention of foreigners suggests that there were non-Israelites living in the northern kingdom who also participated in the Passover celebration. This inclusion is significant as it demonstrates the openness of the worship of Yahweh to those outside the ethnic boundaries of Israel, foreshadowing the New Testament theme of the gospel being available to all nations (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>and those who lived in Judah</b><br>This phrase encompasses the residents of Judah, including both native-born Israelites and any foreigners residing within the territory. The unity of all these groups in worshiping Yahweh during the Passover celebration is a powerful image of communal worship and national identity centered around faith in God. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to gather His people and restore them to Himself, a theme echoed in the prophetic literature (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

The interesting aspect of it is, that probably the persons described had emigrated from their own tribes, as they longed for Jerusalem, "their chief joy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/30-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the whole</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">assembly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;hal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6951.htm">Strong's 6951: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assembly, convocation, congregation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rejoiced</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;
