The temple had two main courtyards: the inner court, where the priests performed their duties, and the outer court, accessible to the general public. The significance of these courtyards lies in their sanctity and purpose, as they were meant for the worship of Yahweh alone. The act of building altars in these sacred spaces indicates a severe violation of the temple's intended use. This desecration reflects a broader pattern of apostasy during the reign of King Manasseh, who led Judah into idolatry. The temple, originally constructed by Solomon, was a symbol of God's presence among His people, and its defilement was a direct affront to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>he built altars to all the host of heaven</b><br>The "host of heaven" refers to celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars, which were often deified in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Building altars to these entities indicates the adoption of astral worship, a practice condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19 and 17</a>:3. This idolatry was a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of any gods other than Yahweh. Manasseh's actions reflect the influence of surrounding pagan nations and their religious practices, which were often syncretized with Israelite worship during periods of spiritual decline. The construction of these altars within the temple courtyards signifies a profound spiritual corruption, as it represents the replacement of Yahweh's worship with that of created entities. This act of idolatry is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, often leading to divine judgment and calls for repentance by the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 55 years and is known for his idolatrous practices, including building altars to celestial bodies in the temple of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites and where God's presence was believed to dwell.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altars_to_the_host_of_heaven.htm">Altars to the Host of Heaven</a></b><br>Manasseh constructed altars dedicated to the worship of celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, which was a direct violation of God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/courtyards_of_the_temple.htm">Courtyards of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple had multiple courtyards, and Manasseh's actions defiled these sacred spaces by introducing idolatrous worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_in_judah.htm">Idolatry in Judah</a></b><br>This event is part of a broader account of idolatry in Judah, which led to spiritual decline and eventual judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual decay and separation from God.
