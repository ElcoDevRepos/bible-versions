The peace experienced during Asa's reign is significant, as it contrasts with the frequent conflicts that characterized much of Israel's history. This peace can be seen as a blessing from God, allowing Asa to focus on strengthening the nation. The peace also reflects Asa's earlier religious reforms, which included removing foreign altars and high places, breaking down sacred pillars, and cutting down Asherah poles, actions that aligned Judah more closely with God's commandments.<p><b>Asa built fortified cities in Judah</b><br>The construction of fortified cities was a strategic move to protect the kingdom from potential future threats. Fortifications were common in the ancient Near East, serving as a defense against invasions and raids. Archaeological evidence from the region shows that cities like Lachish and Jerusalem had significant fortifications during this period. Asa's efforts to build and strengthen these cities demonstrate his wisdom and foresight as a leader, ensuring the security and prosperity of his people. This action also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, as Asa used the time of peace to prepare for any eventualities.<p><b>In those days no one made war with him</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine protection and favor that Asa experienced. The absence of war allowed for economic growth, social stability, and religious reform. It also highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to His people when they obey His commandments. The peace Asa enjoyed can be seen as a direct result of his faithfulness to God, as he sought to lead Judah in accordance with divine laws. This period of peace is reminiscent of the rest promised to Israel in the covenant, contingent upon their obedience.<p><b>because the LORD had given him rest</b><br>The ultimate source of the peace and rest Asa experienced is attributed to the LORD. This divine rest is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with God's covenant blessings. It reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to control the affairs of nations. The rest given to Asa can be seen as a type of the spiritual rest offered through Jesus Christ, who invites believers to find rest for their souls in Him. This rest is not merely the absence of conflict but a deeper, spiritual peace that comes from a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of peace and prosperity.

Scripture repeatedly shows that when a king turns from idolatry and obeys God, peace follows. See the pattern in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>&#8212;obedience and righteousness bring quietness. Asa&#8217;s peace is therefore both literal and covenantal: God kept His promise to &#8220;grant peace in the land&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peace is a gift, not a coincidence. Compare <a href="/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>, where the land had rest because God raised up Othniel.<p>&#8226; Peace provides margin for spiritual and civic projects that constant warfare makes impossible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Asa built fortified cities in Judah</b><p>God-given peace pushed Asa to action, not complacency: &#8220;Asa built fortified cities in Judah&#8221; (14:6). The king used the lull to strengthen what God had entrusted to him, echoing <a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>&#8217;s counsel to prepare your work in the field before building your house.<p>Reasons Asa fortified:<p>&#8226; Stewardship&#8212;responsibly protecting the people God placed under his care (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Preparation&#8212;&#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). Trust never cancels prudence.<p>&#8226; Continuity&#8212;building now meant Judah could withstand future threats, as seen when Zerah the Cushite eventually attacked (14:9&#8211;12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In those days no one made war with him</b><p>The historian repeats the point: &#8220;In those days no one made war with him&#8221; (14:6). This underscores that external aggression was absent, not merely suppressed. Think of <a href="/1_kings/5-4.htm">1 Kings 5:4</a>, where Solomon had &#8220;rest on every side&#8221; so he could build the temple. God sometimes restrains enemies directly (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) and sometimes by deterring them through a leader&#8217;s wise defenses. Either way, the end result is the same&#8212;sustained calm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the LORD had given him rest</b><p>The final clause grounds everything: &#8220;because the LORD had given him rest&#8221; (14:6). The chronicler drives the nail: rest is God&#8217;s doing. <a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a> says, &#8220;The LORD gave them rest on every side,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9&#8211;10</a> applies the same concept spiritually to all who trust Christ. Physical rest in Asa&#8217;s day previews the deeper rest believers now experience by faith. Notice:<p>&#8226; Rest is granted, not earned; Asa&#8217;s reforms positioned Judah to receive what only God could supply (<a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Rest is purposeful; it frees God&#8217;s people to worship and build (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Rest is fragile; it is forfeited when God is forgotten (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7&#8211;9</a>, Asa&#8217;s later lapse).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6</a> paints a simple yet profound picture: because God granted peace, Asa used the respite to fortify Judah. No enemy attacked, for the LORD Himself provided rest. The verse teaches that obedience invites divine peace, divine peace affords opportunity for diligent preparation, and every season of rest should be stewarded gratefully, recognizing its source in the Lord alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And he built fenced cities.</span>--See <a href="/2_chronicles/11-5.htm" title="And Rehoboam dwelled in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.">2Chronicles 11:5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/12-4.htm" title="And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 12:4</a>; and for the expression "had given him rest," <a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;">2Samuel 7:1</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He built fenced cities in Judah</span>.
