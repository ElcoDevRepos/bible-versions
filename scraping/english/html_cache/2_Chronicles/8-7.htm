These groups are frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as the inhabitants of Canaan whom God commanded the Israelites to drive out (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The presence of these people in Solomon's time indicates that the Israelites did not fully obey God's command to remove them, which had long-term implications for Israel's spiritual and cultural purity. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of these groups, with findings such as Hittite inscriptions and Amorite artifacts providing historical context.<p><b>(these people were not Israelites)</b><br>This parenthetical note emphasizes the distinction between the Israelites and the remaining Canaanite populations. The Israelites were chosen by God to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), set apart from other peoples. The continued presence of these non-Israelite groups posed a risk of leading the Israelites into idolatry and away from their covenant with God, as seen in the warnings and consequences outlined in the books of Judges and Kings. This distinction also highlights the theme of separation and holiness that runs throughout the Bible, pointing to the need for God's people to remain distinct in their worship and practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hittites.htm">Hittites</a></b><br>An ancient group of people who lived in the region of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and were known for their advanced civilization and conflicts with Egypt and other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A Semitic people who occupied large parts of Mesopotamia and the Levant.

God promised that one day Israel would possess their land, a promise now largely fulfilled under Solomon.<p>&#8211; Bullet-point snapshot of each group&#8217;s history:<p>&#8226; Hittites &#8211; first appear as landowners near Hebron (<a href="/bsb/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>).<p>&#8226; Amorites &#8211; formidable mountain dwellers defeated by Joshua (<a href="/bsb/joshua/10.htm">Joshua 10</a>).<p>&#8226; Perizzites &#8211; agrarian villagers noted in <a href="/judges/1-5.htm">Judges 1:5</a>.<p>&#8226; Hivites &#8211; the Gibeonites tricked Joshua into a treaty (<a href="/bsb/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jebusites &#8211; original inhabitants of Jerusalem until David captured it (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>).<p>&#8211; By naming them, the Chronicler reminds readers of God&#8217;s faithfulness: every enemy He listed centuries earlier is now under Israelite authority (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>(these people were not Israelites)&#8212;</b><p>&#8211; The parenthetical note clarifies identity and covenant status.

Yet the verse also distinguishes covenant insiders from outsiders, reminding readers that God&#8217;s people must remain distinct while showing measured restraint toward those who live among them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) <span class= "bld">THE FORCED LABOUR OF THE CANAANITES</span><p>(<a href="/context/2_chronicles/8-7.htm" title="As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,">2Chronicles 8:7-10</a>).<p>With this section comp. <a href="/context/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20-23</a>, and the Notes there. In Kings it stands in more obvious connection with what precedes; for there the account of Solomon's buildings is headed by the words, "And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, for to build the house of the Lord," &c. (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm" title="And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.">1Kings 9:15</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">As for all the people that were left.</span>--The verse agrees with <a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-10.</span> - These verses, corresponding very nearly exactly with the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-23</a>), betray how it was a thing never to be forgotten, if only as a fact, that the extermination of the old possessors of the land had not been entire; so that allusion to it is not omitted even by a post-Captivity compiler. The parallel charitably "whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly," where our text shows with exacter fidelity, <span class="cmt_word">whom the children of Israel consumed not</span>. The parallel also uses the words, "levy a tribute of <span class="accented">bond</span>-<span class="accented">service</span>," for our more ambiguous <span class="cmt_word">make to pay tribute</span> (<a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-7</a>). In the words, <span class="cmt_word">until this day</span>, the copyist, shall we say, too slavish, is again detected (ver. 9). The "levy "in <span class="accented">ver.</span> 21 of the parallel probably explains the suddenly mentioned similar language of its fifteenth verse, and again betrays the collected and copied nature of the historic material, the carefulness of sequence not being as observable in selection as might be desired. The distinction between the remnant of aliens and the people of Israel was manifestly that the <span class="accented">menial</span> and the laborious service was put on the former. Useful but familiar references to this whole subject are found in <a href="/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>; <a href="/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>. For our <span class="cmt_word">two hundred and fifty</span> (which gives the number of overseers over Israelites only) the parallel reads, "five hundred and fifty." It will be remembered that an analogous difference occurs between our <a href="/2_chronicles/2-18.htm">2 Chronicles 2:18</a> and <a href="/1_kings/5-16.htm">1 Kings 5:16</a>. Whether it were the determining reason or not in these two places, it is very imaginable that it would be of less importance in the ages of the post-Captivity annalist to dwell on the minutiae of the different treatment of the aliens. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1440;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
