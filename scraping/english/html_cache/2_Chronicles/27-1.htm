His father, Uzziah, had been struck with leprosy and was isolated, which likely prepared Jotham for leadership. This age suggests a level of maturity and readiness for governance, as he would have been involved in royal duties prior to his reign. The age of twenty-five is significant in biblical terms, often associated with the beginning of priestly service (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>), indicating a time of readiness and responsibility.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years</b><br>Jotham's reign in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, lasted sixteen years. This period was marked by relative stability and prosperity, as Jotham followed in the ways of his father Uzziah, but without his father's transgressions (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>). Jerusalem, as the city of David, held great significance as the location of the Temple, the center of worship for the Israelites. Jotham's reign is noted for his construction projects, including the building of the Upper Gate of the Temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>), which reflects his commitment to strengthening the nation's religious and military infrastructure.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok</b><br>The mention of Jotham's mother, Jerushah, and her lineage highlights the importance of maternal influence and heritage in the biblical narrative. Jerushah, meaning "possessed" or "married," was the daughter of Zadok, a name associated with righteousness and priestly lineage. This connection to Zadok may imply a heritage of faithfulness and adherence to God's laws, which could have influenced Jotham's own piety and governance. The inclusion of maternal lineage in the biblical text underscores the role of women in shaping the spiritual and moral character of their children, even in a patriarchal society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jotham was the king of Judah.
