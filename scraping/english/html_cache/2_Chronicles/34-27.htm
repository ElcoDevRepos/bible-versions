This phrase highlights the importance of a responsive and humble spirit, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, which speaks of a broken and contrite heart. The tender heart of King Josiah contrasts with the hardened hearts of many of his predecessors, emphasizing the value God places on humility and openness to His guidance.<p><b>and you humbled yourself before God</b><br>Humility before God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, exemplified by figures such as Moses and David. In the context of Josiah, this humility is demonstrated through his actions of reform and repentance. <a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a> links humility with the fear of the Lord, suggesting that Josiah's actions were rooted in a deep reverence for God. This humility is a key factor in God's favorable response to Josiah.<p><b>when you heard His words against this place and against its people</b><br>The words refer to the Book of the Law found during the temple repairs, likely Deuteronomy, which contained warnings of judgment for disobedience. Josiah's reaction upon hearing these words shows his awareness of the nation's sin and the impending judgment. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to significant religious reforms. The phrase underscores the power of God's word to convict and inspire change.<p><b>and because you have humbled yourself before Me</b><br>Repetition of Josiah's humility emphasizes its significance. Humbling oneself before God is a deliberate act of submission and acknowledgment of His sovereignty. This mirrors the call in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> to humble oneself before the Lord to be lifted up. Josiah's humility is not just an internal attitude but is demonstrated through his actions, aligning with the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>).<p><b>and have torn your clothes and wept before Me</b><br>Tearing one's clothes and weeping were traditional expressions of grief and repentance in ancient Israel. This physical manifestation of sorrow indicates the depth of Josiah's repentance. Similar acts are seen in the lives of other biblical figures, such as Ezra (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>) and Job (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). These actions reflect a genuine contrition and a desire for reconciliation with God.<p><b>I have heard you,&#8217; declares the LORD</b><br>God's response to Josiah's humility and repentance is one of mercy and grace. This assurance of being heard by God is a recurring promise in scripture, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear and heal the land if His people humble themselves and pray. It highlights the relational aspect of God, who responds to sincere repentance and seeks to restore His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.
