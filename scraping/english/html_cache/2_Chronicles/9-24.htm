It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would have a kingdom of peace and prosperity. The regularity of these tributes underscores the stability and wealth of Solomon's kingdom, as well as the respect and recognition he commanded from surrounding nations.<p><b>each visitor would bring his tribute</b><br>Tribute was a common practice in the ancient Near East, where lesser kings or nations would bring gifts to a more powerful ruler as a sign of allegiance or to secure peace. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>, which parallels this account. The bringing of tribute to Solomon highlights his status as a king of great renown and influence, fulfilling the wisdom and wealth God granted him.<p><b>articles of silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold were highly valued in ancient times, often used as currency and for crafting items of beauty and significance. The abundance of these metals in Solomon's kingdom is a testament to his wealth and the prosperity of Israel during his reign. This wealth is also a fulfillment of the blessings promised to Israel if they followed God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<p><b>clothing</b><br>Clothing, especially fine garments, was a significant gift in the ancient world, symbolizing honor and respect. The mention of clothing as part of the tribute indicates the high regard in which Solomon was held. It also reflects the cultural importance of textiles and garments in expressing status and wealth.<p><b>weapons</b><br>Weapons as tribute signify military strength and the acknowledgment of Solomon's power. They could also represent a gesture of peace, as nations would offer weapons to demonstrate submission or alliance. This aligns with the biblical theme of Solomon's reign being one of peace, as his name itself means "peace."<p><b>spices</b><br>Spices were luxury items in the ancient world, often used in religious rituals, anointing, and as perfumes. The inclusion of spices in the tribute highlights the opulence of Solomon's court and the far-reaching trade networks of his kingdom. This also connects to the visit of the Queen of Sheba, who brought spices as gifts (<a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>), symbolizing the international recognition of Solomon's wisdom and wealth.<p><b>horses</b><br>Horses were valuable assets in ancient warfare and transportation, symbolizing power and prestige. Solomon's acquisition of horses from various nations reflects his military strength and the strategic alliances he formed. This is consistent with <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, which mentions Solomon's extensive chariot and horse stables, indicating his preparedness and influence.<p><b>and mules</b><br>Mules, being strong and durable animals, were prized for their utility in transportation and agriculture. Their inclusion in the tribute signifies the practical wealth and resources available to Solomon. The mention of mules also reflects the agricultural prosperity of Israel during his reign, as they were essential for farming and trade.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Solomon reigned and where the Temple was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/visitors_to_solomon.htm">Visitors to Solomon</a></b><br>These were dignitaries, rulers, and people of influence from various nations who came to hear Solomon's wisdom and see his wealth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gifts.htm">Gifts</a></b><br>The items brought to Solomon, which included silver, gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, signifying respect and alliance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_israel.htm">The Kingdom of Israel</a></b><br>Under Solomon's rule, it was a period of peace and prosperity, attracting international attention and tribute.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_godly_wisdom.htm">The Influence of Godly Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's wisdom, a gift from God, attracted people from all over the world.
