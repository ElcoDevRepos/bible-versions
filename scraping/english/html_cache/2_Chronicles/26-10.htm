The foothills and plains of Judah provided ideal grazing land, reflecting the region's agricultural richness. This prosperity is reminiscent of the blessings promised to Israel for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). The mention of livestock also connects to the patriarchs, such as Abraham and Jacob, who were similarly blessed with abundant flocks (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>, <a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>).<p><b>he built towers in the desert</b><br>Building towers in the desert served both defensive and agricultural purposes. These structures were likely watchtowers to protect against raiders and to oversee the land. The desert areas of Judah were vulnerable to attacks, and such fortifications were necessary for security. This action demonstrates Uzziah's wisdom and foresight in protecting his kingdom, similar to the strategic defenses built by other kings like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>).<p><b>and dug many cisterns</b><br>Cisterns were essential for water storage in arid regions, crucial for sustaining life and agriculture. Uzziah's efforts in digging many cisterns show his commitment to ensuring a stable water supply, reflecting his administrative skills and care for his people. This is reminiscent of the efforts of other leaders, such as Hezekiah, who also focused on water supply (<a href="/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>). Water is often symbolic of life and blessing in Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>).<p><b>And since he was a lover of the soil</b><br>Uzziah's love for the soil indicates a deep appreciation for agriculture and the land's productivity. This passion aligns with the biblical theme of stewardship of the earth, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the garden to work and care for it. Uzziah's dedication to agriculture reflects a godly attribute of valuing and nurturing God's creation.<p><b>he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields</b><br>The employment of farmers and vinedressers highlights the organized and prosperous agricultural system under Uzziah's reign. The hill country and fertile fields of Judah were known for their productivity, supporting crops like grapes and olives. This agricultural success fulfills the covenant blessings of a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The imagery of vineyards is also significant in Scripture, often symbolizing Israel itself (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) and later, Jesus as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

Scripture consistently presents livestock as a divine blessing on diligent stewardship (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). Uzziah&#8217;s flocks grazed in the &#8220;foothills and in the plain,&#8221; regions west of Jerusalem that were ideal for pasture (<a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33, 47</a>). Literal geography underlines the point: God provided broad grazing land, and Uzziah recognized and used it.<p>&#8226; This prosperity fulfilled earlier covenant promises that obedience would bring agricultural abundance (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). Uzziah&#8217;s earlier exploits&#8212;fortifying cities and defeating Philistines (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6&#8211;8</a>)&#8212;created security so the herds could thrive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he built towers in the desert</b><p>&#8226; Towers served as watchposts against raiders (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="/judges/8-9.htm">Judges 8:9</a>). By placing them &#8220;in the desert,&#8221; Uzziah extended protection far beyond settled areas, showing foresight and strategic care for what God entrusted to him.<p>&#8226; Isaiah later warned of judgment on complacent watchmen (<a href="/isaiah/21-8.htm">Isaiah 21:8&#8211;9</a>); Uzziah&#8217;s towers illustrate the opposite&#8212;vigilance born of faith. Literal towers meant real safety, safeguarding God&#8217;s blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and dug many cisterns</b><p>&#8226; Water storage was essential in Judah&#8217;s arid zones. Many kings neglected this, but Uzziah &#8220;dug many cisterns,&#8221; paralleling Hezekiah&#8217;s later tunnel (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3&#8211;4</a>). Both demonstrate practical obedience: prepare today for tomorrow&#8217;s drought.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a> praises wise provision &#8220;in the house of the wise,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> condemns &#8220;broken cisterns&#8221; of false security. Uzziah&#8217;s cisterns stand as tangible evidence of trusting God&#8217;s promise while exercising responsible planning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;lover of the soil&#8221; shows Uzziah personally valued agriculture, echoing God&#8217;s original mandate to &#8220;work and keep&#8221; the garden (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). His leadership was hands-on, not merely administrative.<p>&#8226; By placing &#8220;farmers and vinedressers&#8221; in both &#8220;hill country&#8221; and &#8220;fertile fields,&#8221; he diversified crops across microclimates&#8212;grain in valleys, grapes on slopes (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>). This pattern matches Solomon&#8217;s allocation of labor for vineyards and orchards (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1&#8211;2</a> later pictures the Father as vinedresser, pruning for fruitfulness. Uzziah&#8217;s literal vinedressers foreshadow that spiritual lesson: cultivation requires ongoing care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a> portrays King Uzziah as a shepherd-king who maximized God&#8217;s tangible blessings&#8212;livestock, land, water, and crops&#8212;through wise planning and protective infrastructure. Each action reflects covenant faithfulness: enjoying abundance, guarding it, and cultivating it for greater fruitfulness. The verse challenges believers to steward every resource God grants with the same diligence, foresight, and gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">In</span> <span class= "bld">the desert.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">grazing country, i.e.,</span> the "wilderness of Judah," on the west of the Dead Sea.
