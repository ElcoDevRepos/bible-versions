These offerings were completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God. The act of setting aside these offerings indicates a deliberate preparation and sanctification process, reflecting the importance of approaching God with reverence and obedience.<p><b>to be given to the divisions of the families of the people</b><br>This phrase highlights the organized structure of Israelite society, where the Levites and priests were responsible for facilitating worship on behalf of the people. The divisions of families suggest a communal participation in worship, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the nation to uphold the covenant with God. This organization is reminiscent of the division of labor seen in the wilderness tabernacle service.<p><b>to offer to the LORD</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the offerings was to honor and worship Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. This act of offering was not merely ritualistic but was intended to express devotion, gratitude, and repentance. It underscores the centrality of God in the life of the nation and the importance of maintaining a right relationship with Him.<p><b>as it is written in the Book of Moses</b><br>This reference to the Mosaic Law underscores the authority of Scripture in guiding worship practices. The Book of Moses, primarily the Pentateuch, contains detailed instructions for offerings and sacrifices, reflecting God's revealed will for His people. This adherence to the written law highlights the importance of Scripture as the foundation for faith and practice.<p><b>And they did the same with the bulls</b><br>Bulls were significant in sacrificial rituals, often used in burnt offerings and peace offerings. Their use here indicates the scale and seriousness of the worship event.
