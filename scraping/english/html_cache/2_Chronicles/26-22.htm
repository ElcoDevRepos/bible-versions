Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was a king of Judah who reigned for 52 years. His reign is noted for military success, economic prosperity, and significant building projects, including fortifications in Jerusalem. His acts are a testament to his leadership and the prosperity of Judah during his time.<p><b>from beginning to end</b><br>This indicates a complete record of Uzziah's reign, suggesting that his life and reign were thoroughly documented. The phrase underscores the importance of historical records in the biblical narrative, emphasizing the continuity and completeness of the account. It reflects the biblical tradition of chronicling the deeds of kings, which was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz</b><br>Isaiah, a major prophet in the Hebrew Bible, is credited with documenting Uzziah's reign. This connection highlights the intersection of prophetic ministry and royal history. Isaiah's involvement suggests that Uzziah's reign had significant spiritual and theological implications. Isaiah's writings, found in the Book of Isaiah, often address themes of judgment and redemption, which may have been relevant during Uzziah's time. This phrase also points to the historical relationship between prophets and kings in Israel and Judah, where prophets often served as advisors or critics of the monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>Also known as Azariah, he was a king of Judah who reigned for 52 years.
