Fifty shekels of gold for nails indicates the immense wealth and resources dedicated to the construction. In ancient Israel, a shekel was a unit of weight, approximately 11 grams, making the total weight of the gold nails around 550 grams. This reflects the importance of the Temple as a dwelling place for God, emphasizing the reverence and honor given to Him. The use of gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, underscores the sacredness of the Temple. This opulence can be compared to the description of the New Jerusalem in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>, where the city is adorned with gold and precious stones, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people.<p><b>He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.</b><br>The overlaying of the upper rooms with gold further illustrates the splendor of the Temple. These upper rooms, possibly used for storage or as chambers for priests, were also adorned with gold, indicating that every part of the Temple was considered holy and worthy of the finest materials. This reflects the biblical principle that everything dedicated to God should be of the highest quality. The use of gold in the Temple can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as precious and pure, and whose sacrifice was of infinite value. The lavish use of gold in the Temple prefigures the glory and majesty of Christ's eternal kingdom, where believers will dwell with Him in a place of unparalleled beauty and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was tasked with building the temple in Jerusalem, a project initiated by his father, King David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_overlay.htm">Gold Overlay</a></b><br>Represents the opulence and sanctity of the temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nails.htm">Nails</a></b><br>Used in the construction of the temple, signifying the attention to detail and the permanence of the structure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/upper_rooms.htm">Upper Rooms</a></b><br>Part of the temple's architecture, possibly used for storage or additional sacred purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_excellence_in_worship.htm">The Value of Excellence in Worship</a></b><br>The use of gold and the detailed construction of the temple remind us of the importance of offering our best to God in worship.

This echoes <a href="/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a>, where gold is among the first materials named for the Tabernacle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was fifty shekels of gold</b><p>&#8226; Fifty shekels (about 1&#189; pounds/700 g) would have been a staggering sum. By comparison, David bought Araunah&#8217;s threshing floor for &#8220;fifty shekels of silver&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>), so the Temple nails alone out-valued that entire purchase many times over.<p>&#8226; This costly investment demonstrates:<p>&#8211; Israel&#8217;s wholehearted devotion to the Lord (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-7.htm">1 Chronicles 29:7</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s worthiness to receive the best His people could offer (<a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a> contrasts half-hearted gifts).<p>&#8226; The literal weight grounds the account in history, assuring us that the Temple was not symbolic fiction but an actual structure built with measurable materials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also overlaid</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;He also overlaid &#8230;&#8221; reminding us that Solomon went beyond basic construction; he adorned and beautified.<p>&#8226; Overlaying involves covering an existing surface so completely that only gold remains visible&#8212;a picture of how God&#8217;s glory covers His dwelling place (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>).<p>&#8226; This lavish covering fulfills the pattern God revealed to David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11&#8211;12</a>) and matches the instructions for the earlier Tabernacle where the Ark and furnishings were similarly coated (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The upper rooms with gold</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;&#8230; the upper rooms with gold.&#8221; These rooms (side chambers above the Temple&#8217;s main floor; cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5&#8211;10</a>) stored sacred treasures and served priestly functions.<p>&#8226; Gold plating them highlighted their sanctity:<p>&#8211; Everything related to worship, even storage areas, was set apart for God (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>).<p>&#8211; The brilliance of gold reflected light upward, symbolizing heaven&#8217;s purity meeting earth in God&#8217;s house (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a> speaks of the Father of lights).<p>&#8226; The care given to these upper chambers parallels the heavenly pattern Ezekiel later saw for a future temple (<a href="/ezekiel/41-15.htm">Ezekiel 41:15&#8211;17</a>), pointing forward to ultimate fulfillment in Christ&#8217;s kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a> records literal, historic details that spotlight God&#8217;s unmatched worth.

Nothing in His service is trivial, everything is set apart, and every ounce invested in His glory is right and fitting.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And a weight for nails for shekels--fifty in gold.</span> The LXX. and Vulg. take this to mean that the weight of each nail was fifty shekels; and this is probably right, for fifty shekels as a total would be a trifling sum to record along with six hundred talents. The nails were used to fasten the golden plates to the wooden wainscoting of the edifice.<p>Whatever may be thought of the apparently incredible quantities of gold and silver stated to have been amassed by David for the Temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-14.htm" title="Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.">1Chronicles 22:14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-4.htm" title="Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses with:">1Chronicles 29:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-7.htm" title="And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.">1Chronicles 29:7</a>), it is clear that no inconsiderable amount of the former metal would be required for the plating of the chambers as described in this chapter. And it is well known, from their own monuments, that the Babylonian sovereigns of a later age were in the habit of thus adorning the houses of their gods. Nebuchadnezzar, for instance, who restored the great temple of Borsippa, says: "E-zida, the strong house, in the midst thereof I caused to make, with silver, gold, alabaster, bronze . . . cedar I caused to adorn (or, completed) its <span class= "ital">sibir.</span> The cedar of the roof (?) of the shrines of Nebo with gold I caused to clothe." In another inscription we read: "The shrine of Nebo, which is amid E-Sagili, its threshold, its bolt, and its <span class= "ital">babnaku,</span> with gold I caused to clothe." And again: "The cedar roof of the oracle I caused to clothe with bright silver." The Assyrian Esarhaddon, a century earlier, boasts that he built ten castles in Assyria and Accad, and "made them shine like day with silver and gold."<p><span class= "bld">And he overlaid.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the upper chambers he covered with gold.</span> The chambers over the Holy of holies are mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlors thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,">1Chronicles 28:11</a>.

This is the first mention of these "chambers" in the present description, but they have been alluded to by the Chronicle writer before, in <a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. What or where they were is as yet not certainly ascertained. Presumably they were the highest tier of those chambers which surrounded three sides of the main building. But some think they were a superstructure to the holy of holies; others, high chambers in the supposed very lofty superstructure of the porch. Both of these suppositions seem to us of the unlikeliest. It would, however, be much more satisfactory, considering that all the subject before and after treats of the most holy place, to be able to connect this expression in some way with it, nor is there any reason evident for overlaying richly with gold the aforesaid chambers (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a> compared with 2 Chronicles 22:11) of the third tier. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The weight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;q&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
