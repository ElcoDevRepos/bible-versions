Storehouses were essential for preserving the harvest, ensuring food security during times of scarcity. Grain, new wine, and oil were staples in the diet and economy of Israel, symbolizing sustenance, joy, and anointing, respectively. The construction of storehouses reflects a period of prosperity and foresight under King Hezekiah's reign. Biblically, this mirrors Joseph's actions in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>), where he stored grain during years of plenty to prepare for famine. Spiritually, it can be seen as a call to store up spiritual treasures (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>stalls for all kinds of livestock</b><br>Livestock was a sign of wealth and blessing in the ancient Near East. The mention of stalls indicates organized and systematic care for animals, which were vital for agriculture, transportation, and religious sacrifices. This reflects Hezekiah's commitment to maintaining and expanding the kingdom's resources. The care for livestock is reminiscent of the patriarchs, such as Abraham and Job, who were also blessed with abundant flocks and herds (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>, <a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). It underscores the biblical principle of responsible stewardship over God's creation (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>).<p><b>and pens for the flocks</b><br>Flocks, particularly sheep and goats, were central to the agrarian lifestyle of ancient Israel. Pens provided protection from predators and harsh weather, ensuring the well-being of the animals. This phrase suggests a well-organized and prosperous kingdom under Hezekiah's leadership. The imagery of shepherding is prevalent throughout Scripture, often used to describe God's care for His people (Psalm 23, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). It also foreshadows Christ as the Good Shepherd, who tends to His flock with diligence and love. The preparation of pens signifies the importance of safeguarding and nurturing what has been entrusted to one's care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during whose reign this verse is set.

Physical grain in Hezekiah&#8217;s day foreshadows Christ as spiritual sustenance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And new wine and oil</b><p>Alongside grain, Hezekiah stores &#8220;new wine and oil,&#8221; symbols of joy and anointing.<p>&#8226; Joy: &#8220;Wine that gladdens the heart of man&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>) reminds us that God delights in blessing His people with more than bare necessities.<p>&#8226; Refreshment and healing: The good Samaritan &#8220;poured on oil and wine&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>). These supplies point to God&#8217;s provision for restoration in hard times.<p>&#8226; Spirit-filled imagery: Oil often pictures the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>), while wine portrays the new covenant (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-29</a>).
