The alliance was formed to build a fleet of ships intended for trade or exploration. Tarshish is often associated with a distant, wealthy location, possibly in the western Mediterranean, such as modern-day Spain. This endeavor reflects the economic ambitions of the time, as maritime trade was a significant source of wealth. The decision to collaborate with Ahaziah, however, was controversial, as Ahaziah was known for his wickedness, and alliances with ungodly leaders were often discouraged in Scripture (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). This partnership can be seen as a compromise of Jehoshaphat's earlier reforms and commitment to God.<p><b>and these were built in Ezion-geber</b><br>Ezion-geber was a port city located near the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, part of the Red Sea. It was an important hub for trade and shipbuilding during the reigns of Solomon and Jehoshaphat. Archaeological evidence suggests that this area was a center for copper smelting and trade, supporting its role as a significant economic site. The location was strategically chosen for its access to the Red Sea, facilitating trade routes to Africa, Arabia, and beyond. The construction of ships here highlights the advanced maritime capabilities of the Israelites during this period. However, the venture ultimately failed, as God disapproved of the alliance with Ahaziah, leading to the destruction of the ships (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>).

Yet, read in context, the verse warns that partnerships with ungodliness, even for noble-sounding goals, court disaster. Jehoshaphat&#8217;s ships illustrate that success pursued apart from wholehearted trust and obedience sinks before it sails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">And he joined himself with him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and he joined him with himself,</span> an expression only occurring here.<p><span class= "bld">To make ships to go to Tarshish.</span>--In <a href="/context/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48-49</a>, we read: "Jehoshaphat made <span class= "ital">ships</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a fleet) <span class= "ital">of Tarshish, to go to Ophir for gold;</span> and it went not; for the ships were broken (i.e., wrecked) in Ezion-geber. Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships; and Jehoshaphat consented not." There is no mention of a previous alliance and partnership in the ship-building with Ahaziah. Moreover, the expression of our text, "ships to go to Tarshish," appears to be an erroneous paraphrase of "ships of Tarshish," or "<span class= "ital">Tarshish-men,"</span> as we might say; a phrase which really means, vessels built for long sea-voyages. According to Kings, the ships were built "to go to Ophir for gold;" in other words, to renew Solomon's traffic with India from the port on the Red Sea.<p><span class= "bld">And</span> <span class= "bld">they made the</span> <span class= "bld">ships in Ezion-gaber.</span>--The Edomite port at the head of the Gulf of Akaba. If Tarshish means the Phoenician Tartessus in Spain, the fleet could only go thither by doubling the Cape, or crossing the Isthmus of Suez. Therefore some have supposed another Tarshish somewhere in the Persian Gulf or on the north-west coast of India. (See on <a href="/2_chronicles/9-21.htm" title="For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">2Chronicles 9:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - This verse tells us the object with which Jehoshaphat had joined himself with Ahaziah, and <a href="/1_kings/22-49.htm">1 Kings 22:49</a> tells <span class="cmt_word">us</span> how at last, by a point-blank refusal to Ahaziah, he withdrew from the very brief commercial alliance after he had not merely been witnessed against by the Prophet Eliezer spoken of in our next verse, but more decisively witnessed against by the shattering of his ships. To <span class="cmt_word">go to Tarshish</span>. This clause, even if the text is not corrupt, yet cannot mean what it <span class="accented">seems</span> to say; but in the word "to go" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>) must mean, of the sort that were wont to go to Tarshish, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that were used for the Tarshish trade. We are guided to some such explanation by <a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>, where it is said the ships were "ships <span class="accented">of</span> Tarshish to go to <span class="accented">Ophir"</span> (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>). That the ships could not be to go to Tarshish is plain from the fact of the place, Ezion-geber (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17, 18</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), on the Red Sea, where they were built. Some, however, have suggested that some other Tarshish (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the Gulf of Persia)than that of Spain (<span class="accented">Tartessus</span>) may conceivably be meant.
