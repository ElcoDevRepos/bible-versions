It follows a period of religious reform and renewal, where Asa sought to return the people to the worship of Yahweh. The timing is significant as it marks a response to the prophetic encouragement from Azariah, son of Oded, who urged Asa and the people to seek the Lord.<p><b>they sacrificed to the LORD</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, serving as acts of atonement, thanksgiving, and dedication. The act of sacrificing to the LORD signifies a communal return to covenant faithfulness. It reflects the people's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and their dependence on Him. Sacrifices were also a means of consecrating the people and the land to God.<p><b>seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep</b><br>The numbers here are symbolic of completeness and abundance. The use of seven often represents divine perfection or completion in biblical numerology. The large number of animals indicates the magnitude of the people's commitment and the prosperity they experienced. Oxen and sheep were common sacrificial animals, with oxen often used for burnt offerings and sheep for peace offerings.<p><b>from all the plunder they had brought back</b><br>This refers to the spoils of war that Asa and his army had acquired after defeating the Cushites. The act of offering plunder as sacrifices demonstrates a recognition that victory and wealth come from God. It also shows a willingness to dedicate the best of their gains to the LORD, acknowledging His role in their success. This act of giving back to God from their plunder is reminiscent of the principle of firstfruits, where the first and best are offered to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

time</b><p>&#8211; The phrase ties the sacrifice to a specific historical moment: the assembly &#8220;in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa&#8217;s reign&#8221; (2 Chron 15:10).<p>&#8211; It follows Asa&#8217;s victory over Zerah the Cushite (2 Chron 14:9-15) and the prophetic word from Azariah son of Oded (2 Chron 15:1-7), showing an immediate, grateful response to God&#8217;s deliverance.<p>&#8211; Scripture often links timely obedience with blessing, as in <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-31</a> and <a href="/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they sacrificed</b><p>&#8211; Worship moved beyond words to action; the entire community participated (compare 2 Chron 29:20-24).<p>&#8211; Sacrifice remained the God-ordained means of expressing devotion and atonement (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Their willing giving echoes Samuel&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>), because true sacrifice flows from obedient hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the

just removed foreign altars (2 Chron 15:8), so the direction of worship is clear and uncompromised.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a> links thank offerings with genuine gratitude, exactly what Asa and the people display here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven hundred oxen</b><p>&#8211; Oxen were valuable, large animals used for labor and for high-value offerings (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>).<p>&#8211; The substantial number signals costly thanksgiving&#8212;mirroring David&#8217;s refusal to offer that which costs him nothing (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).<p>&#8211; The &#8220;seven&#8221; motif hints at completeness and covenant faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and seven thousand sheep</b><p>&#8211; Sheep provided for burnt, fellowship, and peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/3-6.htm">Leviticus 3:6-11</a>).<p>&#8211; The ten-to-one ratio of sheep to oxen reflects customary sacrificial balance (2 Chron 30:24; 35:7).<p>&#8211; Again, &#8220;seven&#8221; amplifies the sense of fullness; the abundance echoes God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a> that barns overflow when firstfruits honor Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from all the plunder they had brought back</b><p>&#8211; The animals were part of the war spoils taken after God granted victory (2 Chron 14:13-15).<p>&#8211; Offering plunder recognizes the Lord as the true giver of triumph (1 Chron 29:14; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8211; It models dedicating the first and best of unexpected gain to God (<a
