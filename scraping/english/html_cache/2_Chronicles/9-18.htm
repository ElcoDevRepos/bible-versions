The number six, often associated with human effort and imperfection, contrasts with the divine perfection symbolized by the number seven. This detail highlights the human aspect of Solomon's rule, despite his God-given wisdom. The steps also signify the elevated status of the king, both literally and figuratively, as he ascends to his seat of judgment and authority.<p><b>and a footstool of gold was attached to it</b><br>The footstool of gold signifies the wealth and opulence of Solomon's kingdom, as gold was a symbol of divine favor and prosperity. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, a footstool represented subjugation and dominion, often used metaphorically to describe the king's enemies as being under his feet. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where God says to the Messiah, "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet," foreshadowing the ultimate reign of Christ.<p><b>There were armrests on both sides of the seat</b><br>The presence of armrests on Solomon's throne indicates a design for comfort and stability, befitting a king of his stature. Armrests also symbolize support and strength, suggesting the king's ability to uphold justice and maintain order in his kingdom. This detail reflects the wisdom and discernment Solomon was known for, as he was tasked with governing the people of Israel with fairness and righteousness.<p><b>with a lion standing beside each armrest</b><br>Lions are emblematic of strength, courage, and royalty, often associated with the tribe of Judah, from which Solomon descended. The presence of lions beside the armrests underscores the king's authority and the divine mandate to rule. In biblical symbolism, the lion is also a type of Christ, the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), representing Jesus' ultimate kingship and power. The imagery of lions on Solomon's throne foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, who will reign with perfect justice and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the construction of the temple and his own palace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/throne_of_solomon.htm">Throne of Solomon</a></b><br>A symbol of Solomon's authority and the grandeur of his reign, described as having six steps and adorned with gold and lions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Solomon's throne was located, serving as the political and spiritual center of the nation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Symbolic creatures representing strength, majesty, and royal authority, often associated with the tribe of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/footstool_of_gold.htm">Footstool of Gold</a></b><br>A luxurious addition to the throne, emphasizing the wealth and splendor of Solomon's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_authority_and_majesty.htm">Symbol of Authority and Majesty</a></b><br>Solomon's throne, with its intricate design and luxurious materials, serves as a powerful symbol of his God-given authority and the majesty of his reign.
