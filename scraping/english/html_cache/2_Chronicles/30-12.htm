The "power of God" suggests a supernatural intervention, indicating that the people's actions were not merely human decisions but were guided by divine will. This reflects the biblical theme that God can move the hearts of people to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, where the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom, and its people were often called to return to God amidst periods of idolatry and apostasy.<p><b>to give them one heart</b><br>The unity of heart among the people signifies a collective agreement and purpose, which is often seen as a sign of God's blessing and presence. In biblical terms, having "one heart" implies a shared commitment and focus, reminiscent of the early church in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a>, where believers were of one heart and soul. This unity was crucial for the success of religious reforms and revival, as division often led to failure and conflict.<p><b>to obey the command of the king and his officials</b><br>This obedience to the king and his officials underscores the importance of godly leadership. In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, King Hezekiah was leading a religious reform, calling the people back to the worship of Yahweh and the observance of Passover. The king's command was aligned with God's law, showing the ideal relationship between divine authority and human governance. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders should guide people according to God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>.<p><b>according to the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the actions and commands were in accordance with divine revelation. The "word of the LORD" refers to the Scriptures and prophetic messages that guided Israel's religious and moral life. It highlights the importance of aligning human actions with God's revealed will, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible. This obedience to God's word is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and the prophets, as stated in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>. The alignment with God's word ensured that the reforms were not just political but deeply spiritual, aiming to restore true worship and covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and called for the celebration of the Passover.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Hezekiah reigned and sought to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_god.htm">The Hand of God</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating God's influence and power in uniting the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_princes.htm">The Princes</a></b><br>Leaders and officials in Judah who supported Hezekiah's reforms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine command or instruction that guided Hezekiah and the leaders in their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_as_a_divine_gift.htm">Unity as a Divine Gift</a></b><br>True unity among believers is a work of God.
