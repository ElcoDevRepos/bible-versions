Jerusalem holds significant biblical importance as the site of the future Temple, which Solomon would build. This journey marks the beginning of Solomon's reign, emphasizing the continuity of Davidic kingship. Jerusalem is often seen as a type of the heavenly city, representing God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>from the high place in Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant location for worship before the Temple was built in Jerusalem. The "high place" refers to an elevated site used for worship, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Gibeon was where the Tabernacle, or Tent of Meeting, was located at this time, making it a central place for Israelite worship. This highlights the transitional period in Israel's religious practices, moving from temporary worship sites to a permanent Temple. Gibeon is also associated with the Gibeonite deception in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>, showing the complex history of the site.<p><b>from before the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. It symbolized God's presence among His people and was the center of Israelite worship. Solomon's departure from the Tent of Meeting to Jerusalem foreshadows the shift from a mobile worship system to a permanent Temple. This transition reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to establish a place for His name to dwell permanently, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.<p><b>and he reigned over Israel</b><br>Solomon's reign over Israel marks the zenith of the united monarchy, characterized by peace, prosperity, and extensive building projects, including the Temple. His rule is often seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>, where God assures David that his offspring will build a house for His name. Solomon's reign is a type of Christ's future reign, symbolizing wisdom, justice, and peace. However, it also foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom due to Solomon's later unfaithfulness, as warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.

Perhaps "to (or <span class= "ital">at</span>) the high place that was at G-ibeon," was originally a marginal gloss upon this expression. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/1-3.htm" title="So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.">2Chronicles 1:3</a>.) The reading, "And Solomon came to Jerusalem from before the tent of tryst," would be quite intelligible without this addition.<p><span class= "bld">And reigned over Israel.</span>--Syr., <span class= "ital">over all Israel.</span> (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm" title="So king Solomon was king over all Israel.">1Kings 4:1</a>.) But the remark, "and he reigned over Israel," is by no means "superfluous" (Bertheau), inasmuch as it naturally introduces the following sketch of the reign, which carries us on from God's promise to its fulfilment.<p>The chronicler does not notice the sacrifices which, on his return, Solomon offered before the ark at Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/3-15.htm" title="And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.">1Kings 3:15</a>), nor the story of the king's wise judgment which there follows (<a href="/context/1_kings/3-16.htm" title="Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.">1Kings 3:16-28</a>). It is unreasonable to seek any other ground of such omissions than the free and legitimate exercise of the compiler's discretion in the choice of his own materials. That he did not depreciate the sanctuary on Mount Zion as a place of sacrifice, is evident from <a href="/1_chronicles/21-18.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">1Chronicles 21:18</a> to <a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1Chronicles 22:1</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Solomon's return after sacrifice from Gibeon to Jerusalem, and from</span> "<span class="accented">before the tabernacle of the congregation"</span> <span class="accented">to</span> "<span class="accented">before</span> <span class="accented">the ark of the covenant of the Lord"</span> <span class="accented">in Mount Zion.</span> (<a href="/1_kings/3-15.htm">1 Kings 3:15</a>) This verse not merely bears the trace of a slightly corrupt text in the presence of the Hebrew preposition: before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, where there can be no doubt the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5b0;</span> should stand, but also suggests (keeping in view our ver. 3, and comparing <a href="/1_kings/3-15.htm">1 Kings 3:15</a>) the condensed and cut-down method of Chronicles, and its strong preferences for <span class="accented">selecting</span> out of the various material at its command. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the congregation.</span> This styling of the "tabernacle" is of very frequent occurrence. It is found above thirty times in Exodus, and fully as often in Leviticus and Numbers. Afterwards it is sprinkled more rarely in the historical books. The reason of its being styled "the tabernacle of the <span class="accented">congregation"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) is doubtful - perhaps because of the gatherings of the people in front of it, or possibly because of its being the place where God would meet with Moses. The other name, the tabernacle of "witness" or "testimony" or covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>; <a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.), is not unfrequent.
