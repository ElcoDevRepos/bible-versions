Appointing Abijah as chief prince indicates a strategic move to establish a clear line of succession. Abijah, being the son of Maacah, held a significant position, as Maacah was a granddaughter of Absalom, adding a royal lineage that could strengthen claims to the throne. This appointment reflects the common practice in ancient monarchies of designating a successor to prevent disputes among potential heirs. The role of chief prince would have involved significant responsibilities, including military leadership and governance, preparing Abijah for future kingship.<p><b>intending to make him king</b><br>Rehoboam's intention to make Abijah king highlights the importance of securing a stable succession plan. This decision was likely influenced by the need to ensure loyalty and continuity within the ruling family, especially after the kingdom's division. The choice of Abijah suggests that Rehoboam saw him as the most capable or politically advantageous option among his sons. This intention also underscores the dynastic nature of the Davidic line, which was central to the identity and theology of Judah. The Davidic covenant, as outlined in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, promised a lasting dynasty, and Rehoboam's actions can be seen as an effort to uphold this divine promise. The eventual kingship of Abijah, as recorded in subsequent chapters, would continue the Davidic line, which Christians believe ultimately culminates in Jesus Christ, the prophesied eternal king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, known for his role in the division of the united kingdom of Israel into the northern and southern kingdoms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The son of Rehoboam and Maacah, appointed as chief prince with the intention of becoming king, indicating his favored status among his siblings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/maacah.htm">Maacah</a></b><br>The mother of Abijah, a significant figure in the royal family, whose influence may have played a role in Abijah's appointment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom over which Rehoboam ruled, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where Rehoboam reigned and made significant political decisions, including the appointment of Abijah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_favoritism.htm">Leadership and Favoritism</a></b><br>Rehoboam's decision to appoint Abijah as chief prince reflects the complexities of leadership and the potential pitfalls of favoritism.

(1 Chron 23:1).<p>&#8226; Rehoboam is reorganizing his royal house after the northern tribes&#8217; split (2 Chron 11:5&#8211;12), demonstrating that Judah&#8217;s throne remains stable in spite of national upheaval.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abijah son of Maacah</b><p>&#8226;

His mother, Maacah, is the granddaughter of Absalom, adding a Davidic royal line through both parents (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God later commends something &#8220;good&#8221;
