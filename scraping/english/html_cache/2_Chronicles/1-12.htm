In the biblical context, wisdom and knowledge are often seen as divine gifts, essential for righteous leadership. Solomon's request aligns with the values expressed in Proverbs, many of which are attributed to him, emphasizing the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The granting of wisdom and knowledge is a fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon, setting him apart as a king who would lead with discernment and understanding.<p><b>And I will also give you riches and wealth and honor</b><br>This promise of material blessings is significant in the historical context of Israel's monarchy. Riches and wealth were often seen as signs of God's favor and were crucial for establishing a strong and prosperous kingdom. The honor bestowed upon Solomon would elevate his status among other nations, fulfilling the Abrahamic promise of making Israel a blessing to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). This also prefigures the messianic kingdom, where the King, Jesus Christ, is exalted and honored above all.<p><b>unlike anything given to the kings before you or after you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the unparalleled nature of Solomon's reign. Historically, Solomon's wealth and wisdom were renowned, attracting leaders like the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-13</a>). Theologically, this sets Solomon apart as a type of Christ, whose kingdom is described as one of peace and prosperity. However, unlike Solomon, Christ's kingdom is eternal and spiritual, surpassing all earthly reigns. Solomon's unique blessings foreshadow the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus, the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

Solomon asked for discernment to lead God&#8217;s people; he did not seek personal gain. God now draws the conclusion: because the king&#8217;s heart was aligned with God&#8217;s priorities, a unique blessing follows.

In addition, God lavished riches, wealth, and honor upon him at a level no other king would experience, illustrating God&#8217;s pattern of rewarding those who prioritize His purposes. The verse affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to answer prayer, His generosity toward obedient servants, and His power to bestow blessings beyond what we ask or imagine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Wisdom and knowledge.</span>--<span class= "ital">The wisdom and the knowledge,</span> viz., which thou hast asked for.<p><span class= "bld">Is granted unto thee.</span>--The Hebrew expression is found only here and in <a href="/esther/3-11.htm" title="And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.">Esther 3:11</a>.

The Assyrian kings were fond of similar comparisons between themselves and their predecessors. Kings: "That there hath not been (<span class= "ital">i.e., shall not be</span>) a man like thee among the kings, all thy days," a different promise. The conditional promise, "And if thou wilt walk in my ways . . .

On the other hand, the gratuitous and spontaneous fulness of promise in the Divine reply to a human prayer that "pleased" the Being invoked is most noticeable, and preached beforehand indeed, the lesson of the life of Jesus, "Seek ye first the kingdom... and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). The contents of this verse are followed in the parallel by the words," And Solomon awoke; and behold it was a dream." There can be no doubt that what is here rehearsed did not lose any force or anything of reality from its transpiring in a dream, of which the abundantly open statement of the method of it, as in "sleep," and in "a dream," may be accepted as the first cogent evidence. But beside this, the frequent recital in the Old Testament of occasions when significant and weighty matters of business import were so conducted by the Divine will forms ample ground and defence for the other class of occasions, of which more spiritual matter was the subject (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-7.htm">Genesis 41:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 24</a>; <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/40-5.htm">Genesis 40:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>; Judges . 7:15; <a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13, 22</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>). On the other hand, side by side with such passages are those that refer to dreams for their emptiness and transiency of impression, when similes of this kind of thing are required (<a href="/job/20-8.htm">Job 20:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1</a>). This is not the place to enter into any argument of a metaphysical or physiological character respecting dreams, and what they may or may not avail. But as some persons know even too well how dreams have brought them most vivid, most torturing, and most exquisite experiences in turn, there will seem, to them at least, the less difficulty in admitting utterly their availableness for communications of highest import, not only from God to man, but under certain conditions from man to God. Without doubt, certain disabilities (and those, perhaps, more especially of the moral kind) attach to our mind in dreams. But do not dreams also find the scene of the keener activities of mind pure? Granted that the mind is then under ordinary circumstances without a certain control and self-commanding power, yet is it also in some large respects much more at liberty from that besetting tyranny of sense with which waking hours are so familiar! Hence its consummate daring and swiftness and versatility in dream beyond all that it knows in the body's waking state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">therefore wisdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
