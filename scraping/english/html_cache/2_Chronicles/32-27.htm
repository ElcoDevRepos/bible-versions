His wealth and honor were a testament to God's blessing, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>, where it states that the Lord was with him, and he prospered wherever he went. This prosperity can be seen as a fulfillment of the covenant blessings promised to Israel for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). Hezekiah's wealth also reflects the political stability and economic growth during his reign, following the Assyrian threat's retreat.<p><b>and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles</b><br>The construction of treasuries indicates a period of peace and security, allowing Hezekiah to focus on accumulating and safeguarding wealth. The mention of silver, gold, and precious stones highlights the economic prosperity and trade relations of Judah during this time. Spices were highly valued in the ancient Near East, often used in religious rituals and as luxury items, indicating Judah's involvement in long-distance trade. Shields, while practical for defense, also symbolized strength and military preparedness. The accumulation of "all kinds of valuable articles" suggests a kingdom flourishing under God's favor, reminiscent of Solomon's wealth (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>).

Earlier we read, &#8220;The LORD was with him; and wherever he went he prospered&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>). His material success is a concrete sign of God&#8217;s favor after his reforms and steadfast faith during the Assyrian crisis. Similar language appears regarding Abraham (<a href="/genesis/24-35.htm">Genesis 24:35</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23</a>), reminding us that God sometimes magnifies His servants to display covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he made treasuries for his silver</b><p>Wise stewardship follows divine blessing. Rather than squandering resources, Hezekiah &#8220;made treasuries&#8221; (storehouses) to safeguard wealth. Proverbs underscores this principle: &#8220;Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of the wise&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a>). His treasuries later become the very assets he shows the Babylonian envoys (<a href="/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>), illustrating both prudence and the danger of pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gold</b><p>Gold in Scripture often symbolizes both royalty and purity. Solomon&#8217;s temple was overlaid with gold (2 Chron 3:4&#8211;8), and Revelation pictures heavenly streets of gold (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>). Hezekiah&#8217;s accumulation situates him in that royal line, reflecting the Lord&#8217;s promise to keep David&#8217;s descendants secure when they walk uprightly (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>precious stones</b><p>From the high priest&#8217;s breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17&#8211;21</a>) to the New Jerusalem&#8217;s foundations (<a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>), precious stones signify beauty, permanence, and covenant glory. By noting Hezekiah&#8217;s jewels, the chronicler shows how Judah&#8217;s king became a living picture of Israel&#8217;s ideal: &#8220;You shall be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>spices</b><p>Spices suggest worship and royal privilege. The Queen of Sheba&#8217;s lavish gift of &#8220;large quantities of spices&#8221; to Solomon (2 Chron 9:9) echoes here. Spices perfumed the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23&#8211;25</a>) and Jesus&#8217; burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). Their presence in Hezekiah&#8217;s stores ties prosperity to the sweet aroma of devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shields</b><p>Military preparedness accompanies prosperity. Solomon forged shields of gold for ceremonial guard duty (<a href="/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16&#8211;17</a>); Hezekiah does likewise. While 2 Chron 32:5 notes his reinforcement of defenses, the real shield is God Himself: &#8220;You, O LORD, are a shield around me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>). Material shields reflect a spiritual reality&#8212;trust in God&#8217;s protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all kinds of valuable articles</b><p>The phrase gathers every other category. Paul later uses a household image: &#8220;In a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>). The chronicler&#8217;s list invites readers to marvel at God&#8217;s generosity while recognizing that true value lies in being set apart for His purposes (<a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a> records a God-given abundance that follows Hezekiah&#8217;s faithfulness. Each item&#8212;silver, gold, gems, spices, shields, and diverse valuables&#8212;declares the Lord&#8217;s ability to bless, the king&#8217;s wisdom in managing wealth, and the call to use every gift for God&#8217;s glory. The verse encourages gratitude, prudent stewardship, and humble acknowledgment that all prosperity originates from the covenant-keeping God who shields and honors those who walk in His ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Had.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">got.</span><p><span class= "bld">Riches and honour</span> (or, <span class= "ital">wealth;
