His long life is seen as a blessing from God, reflecting his faithfulness and righteousness. In biblical terms, being "full of years" often signifies a life lived in accordance with God's will, similar to the patriarchs like Abraham and Isaac. This phrase underscores the respect and honor given to Jehoiada for his service to God and the nation of Judah.<p><b>he died at the age of 130</b><br>The age of 130 is significant, as it is notably longer than the typical lifespan during this period, suggesting divine favor. This extraordinary age parallels the lifespans of early biblical figures, indicating Jehoiada's importance in God's plan. His death marks the end of an era of spiritual leadership and protection for Judah, as Jehoiada was instrumental in guiding King Joash and restoring the temple. The mention of his age highlights the transition in leadership and the potential challenges that would follow without his guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest in Judah who played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash, the rightful heir to the throne, from Queen Athaliah's massacre.

Jehoiada&#8217;s passing is recorded with honor, unlike the abrupt, judgment-laden deaths of unfaithful priests such as Eli&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; His death creates a leadership vacuum that exposes Joash&#8217;s later drift (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-18</a>), underscoring how one faithful life can restrain national decline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the age of 130</b><p>&#8226; 130 is exceptional yet presented matter-of-factly, affirming Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy.

We seem to know too little of him, and the parallel supplies considerably less than our text in Chronicles. His age, as stated in this verse when he died, seems very improbable, and for a very clear and admirable putting of the case, see Lord Arthur C. Hervey's article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:944. There is, however, no manifest or even suspicious symptom of corruptness in the text just here, supported as it is by the Septuagint and Josephus, by the stress laid on his old age, whether it showed a hundred and thirty years, or thirty years or fifty years (as have been variously suggested) fewer; the little fact, otherwise looking very significant, that the expression, <span class="cmt_word">full of days</span>, is used beside only of Abraham, Isaac, Job, and <span class="accented">David</span>, loses its pertinence in that very circumstance that it <span class="accented">is</span> used of David, whose age was in no way extreme.
