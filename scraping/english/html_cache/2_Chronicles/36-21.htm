According to Levitical law, every seventh year was to be a Sabbath year, a time when the land was to rest and not be cultivated (<a href="/leviticus/25-4.htm">Leviticus 25:4</a>). The Israelites had neglected this command, and the exile served as a period for the land to receive its due rest. This concept underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences of neglecting them.<p><b>all the days of the desolation,</b><br>The desolation refers to the period when the land of Judah was uninhabited following the Babylonian conquest. This was a time of judgment and purification, as the land was left to recover from the overuse and neglect of the Sabbath years. The desolation also symbolizes the spiritual barrenness that results from disobedience to God.<p><b>until seventy years were completed,</b><br>The seventy years of exile were prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>; 29:10) and represent a complete cycle of judgment and restoration. This period is significant in biblical prophecy and history, marking the time from the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC to the decree of Cyrus allowing the Jews to return in 538 BC. The seventy years also reflect God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises and His sovereignty over history.<p><b>in fulfillment of the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah.</b><br>Jeremiah's prophecies about the Babylonian exile and the subsequent return of the Jews highlight the role of prophecy in the biblical narrative. <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a> specifically mentions the seventy-year period, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of God's word.
