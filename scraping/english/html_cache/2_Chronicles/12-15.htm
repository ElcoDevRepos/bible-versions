His reign is marked by a lack of wisdom compared to his father, Solomon. The phrase "from first to last" suggests a comprehensive account of his reign, indicating that his actions, both good and bad, were recorded. This reflects the biblical principle that God is aware of all human actions and holds leaders accountable.<p><b>are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the Prophet and of Iddo the Seer concerning the genealogies?</b><br>Shemaiah and Iddo were prophets during the time of Rehoboam. Shemaiah is known for delivering God's message to Rehoboam, warning him not to fight against the northern tribes after the kingdom split. Iddo is mentioned in other parts of the Bible as a chronicler of the kings. The mention of "genealogies" highlights the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite culture, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promises through specific family lines. This also underscores the role of prophets and seers in documenting history and providing divine insight.<p><b>There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days.</b><br>The division of the kingdom led to ongoing conflict between Rehoboam, who ruled Judah, and Jeroboam, who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel. This strife is a direct consequence of Rehoboam's harsh policies and failure to heed wise counsel, leading to the fulfillment of God's judgment on Solomon's house. The persistent warfare symbolizes the spiritual and political division that plagued Israel, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience to God. This conflict also foreshadows the eventual downfall of both kingdoms due to their continued unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by division and conflict.

The verse reinforces the historical accuracy of Scripture, highlights God&#8217;s concern for covenant lineage, and warns that prideful choices can spark wars that outlive a generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The authority quoted by the writer of Kings (1 Kings 14:29, 30) is "the book of the Chronicles [literally, <span class="accented">the book of the acts of the days</span>, i.q. the title of our 'Chronicles'] of the kings of Judah," on which follows in the next verse the substantive statement, "And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days." The authorities quoted here are the works of Shemaiah and of Iddo, and it is possible that the following words touching the continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, which have not the substantive verb among them, may have been part of the title of Iddo's work, although it is more probable that his work on 'Genealogies' would retain the character of a specialty. We subjoin for English readers a literal translation of this verse: "And the words (acts) of Jeroboam first and last, are they not written in the words (acts) of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer touching genealogies" [but Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>," in the manner of a genealogical table"] "and wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam perpetual." We think that neither our Authorized Version nor Gesenius's rendering probably convey the correct meaning. The hithp, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> would be better satisfied by the rendering, "to make a register," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to preserve a continued register of David's genealogy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the acts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;i&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
