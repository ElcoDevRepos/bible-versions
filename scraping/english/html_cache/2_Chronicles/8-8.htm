These groups were present in the land before the Israelites entered under Joshua's leadership. Despite God's command to drive out these nations completely (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>), some remained due to incomplete conquests. The presence of these descendants highlights the ongoing influence and integration of Canaanite culture within Israel, which often led to idolatry and disobedience to God.<p><b>those whom the Israelites had not destroyed</b><br>This indicates that the Israelites did not fully obey God's command to destroy the Canaanite nations. The failure to completely remove these peoples led to various problems, including the temptation to adopt pagan practices. This incomplete obedience is a recurring theme in Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>, where various tribes failed to drive out the inhabitants of the land. This disobedience had long-term consequences for Israel's spiritual and social life.<p><b>Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers</b><br>Solomon's use of forced labor from the remaining Canaanite populations reflects a common practice in the ancient Near East, where conquered peoples were often used for labor. This practice allowed Solomon to undertake massive building projects, including the construction of the Temple and his palace. While this labor system was efficient, it also created social stratification and tension within the kingdom. Solomon's actions can be seen as pragmatic but also as a departure from the ideal of Israel as a distinct and holy nation.<p><b>as they are to this day</b><br>This phrase suggests that the practice of using these descendants as forced laborers continued beyond Solomon's reign. It indicates a lasting social structure that persisted in Israel, reflecting the enduring consequences of Solomon's policies. The phrase also serves as a historical note, emphasizing the continuity of certain practices and the long-term impact of decisions made by Israel's leaders. This continuity can be seen as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience and the integration of foreign influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people and were given the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the Promised Land, many of whom were not completely driven out by the Israelites as commanded by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/labor_force.htm">Labor Force</a></b><br>The group of people conscripted by Solomon for his building projects, which included the descendants of the Canaanites who remained in the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God gave to the Israelites, encompassing territories that were once inhabited by various Canaanite tribes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to fully obey God's command to destroy the Canaanites led to ongoing challenges and compromises.
