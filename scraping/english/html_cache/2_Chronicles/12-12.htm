However, his act of humbling himself is significant, as humility is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). This act of repentance aligns with the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). Rehoboam's humility is a turning point, showing that even flawed leaders can seek God's mercy.<p><b>the anger of the LORD turned away from him</b><br>God's anger is often depicted as a response to sin and disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8</a>). In this context, it reflects God's justice and holiness. However, God's willingness to turn away His anger upon Rehoboam's repentance demonstrates His mercy and readiness to forgive (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-12</a>). This turning away of anger is a precursor to the ultimate reconciliation offered through Christ, who bore God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<p><b>and He did not destroy him completely</b><br>The phrase indicates that while God allowed consequences for Rehoboam's actions, He spared him from total destruction. This partial judgment is consistent with God's dealings with Israel, where He often disciplines but preserves a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). It underscores God's covenant faithfulness and His commitment to His promises, despite human failure.<p><b>Indeed, conditions were good in Judah</b><br>Following Rehoboam's repentance, Judah experienced a period of relative peace and stability. This reflects the biblical principle that obedience to God brings blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The prosperity in Judah serves as a testament to God's grace and the benefits of aligning with His will. It also foreshadows the peace and restoration that Christ brings to those who follow Him (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by a division of the kingdom and subsequent challenges, including invasions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which Rehoboam ruled.

Rehoboam, after initially rejecting prophetic correction (12:1&#8211;5), chooses to bow before God&#8217;s rebuke (12:6).<p>- Scripture underscores that God esteems humility: &#8220;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; cf. <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p>- The king&#8217;s acknowledgment of his sin parallels earlier examples&#8212;David after Nathan&#8217;s rebuke (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) and Ahab&#8217;s temporary penitence (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>).<p>- True repentance is never mere words; it involves a heart posture that God takes seriously (<a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the anger of the LORD turned away from him</b><p>- Divine wrath is real and personal, yet it is not capricious. God&#8217;s righteous anger responds to sin but relents when sinners genuinely repent (<a href="/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>).<p>- Rehoboam experiences what Moses proclaimed: God is &#8220;compassionate and merciful, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<p>- The turning away of wrath foreshadows Christ&#8217;s atoning work, where God&#8217;s just anger against sin is satisfied (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He did not destroy him completely</b><p>- Judgment was deserved&#8212;Shishak&#8217;s invasion had already proved that (12:2-4). Yet God sets limits to discipline, preserving David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>- The phrase &#8220;not destroy&#8230;completely&#8221; highlights covenant faithfulness. Even when God chastens, He remembers His promises (<a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-33</a>).<p>- Believers today see the same pattern: &#8220;The Lord disciplines the one He loves&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), but ultimate destruction is withheld from those in covenant with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, conditions were good in Judah</b><p>- After repentance, Judah enjoys a measure of stability: fortifications stand, worship continues, the economy recovers (12:11-16).<p>- Obedience brings blessing; disobedience brings hardship. This consistent principle appears from <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> to Jesus&#8217; teaching in <a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10-11</a>.<p>- God&#8217;s goodness is not merely the absence of disaster but the presence of well-being under His favor (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8-10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/12-12.htm">2 Chronicles 12:12</a> shows that genuine humility reverses divine anger, limits judgment, and restores blessing.
