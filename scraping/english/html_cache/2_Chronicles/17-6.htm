The "heart" in biblical terms refers to the center of one's being, encompassing will, emotions, and intellect. Jehoshaphat's delight in God's ways suggests a deep, personal commitment to following God's commandments and statutes, reminiscent of David's heart for God (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This delight is not merely an obligation but a joyful pursuit, aligning with <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, which speaks of delighting in the law of the Lord. Jehoshaphat's reign is marked by religious reforms and a return to the worship of Yahweh, setting a standard for godly leadership.<p><b>furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.</b><br>The removal of high places and Asherah poles signifies Jehoshaphat's commitment to purifying worship in Judah. High places were often sites of idol worship, including Canaanite deities, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. Asherah poles were associated with the goddess Asherah, a symbol of fertility and a common object of worship in the region. By removing these, Jehoshaphat was not only obeying the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) but also following the example of his father, Asa, who also sought to rid the land of idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3</a>). This action reflects a broader biblical theme of removing sin and idolatry to restore true worship, as seen in the reforms of other kings like Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). Jehoshaphat's actions foreshadow the ultimate cleansing and restoration brought by Jesus Christ, who calls for worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his devotion to God and efforts to reform the nation spiritually.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoshaphat reigned and implemented religious reforms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites often used for idol worship, which Jehoshaphat sought to remove to purify worship practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, which were also removed by Jehoshaphat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom Jehoshaphat served with a devoted heart, leading to his reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/devotion_to_god.htm">Devotion to God</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD, demonstrating the importance of sincere commitment to God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_reformation.htm">Spiritual Reformation</a></b><br>Removing high places and Asherah poles signifies the need for spiritual cleansing and reform in our personal lives and communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's actions reflect obedience to God's commands, reminding us of the importance of aligning our actions with Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_influence.htm">Leadership and Influence</a></b><br>As a leader, Jehoshaphat used his influence to guide his nation towards God, illustrating the impact of godly leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Removing entrenched idol worship required courage, encouraging us to stand firm in our faith even when it challenges societal norms.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_17_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 17:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_emulate_Jehoshaphat_s_devotion.htm">How can we emulate Jehoshaphat's "heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_did_Jehoshaphat_remove_idols.htm">What steps did Jehoshaphat take to remove "high places and Asherah poles"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jehoshaphat_s_devotion_daily_worship.htm">How does Jehoshaphat's devotion in 2 Chronicles 17:6 inspire our daily worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jehoshaphat_s_acts_to_Exodus_20_3.htm">Connect Jehoshaphat's actions to the First Commandment in Exodus 20:3.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Which_modern_high_places_to_remove_2.htm">What modern "high places" might we need to remove from our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_17_6_Jehoshaphat_s_God_devotion.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 17:6 reflect King Jehoshaphat's commitment to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_heart_devoted_to_the_LORD.htm">What does "his heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD" mean in 2 Chronicles 17:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_17_6_s_role_in_religious_reform.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 17:6 demonstrate the importance of religious reform?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_the_discrepancy_on_jehoshaphat's_actions.htm">In 1 Kings 22:43, why does the text imply Jehoshaphat removed high places when 2 Chronicles 20:33 suggests otherwise?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_does_jehoshaphat's_reform_seem_inconsistent.htm">(2 Chronicles 17:6) How is the claim that Jehoshaphat removed high places consistent with other passages stating they persisted under various kings?

God consistently measures faithfulness by inward loyalty, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>: &#8220;the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro&#8230; to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is fully devoted to Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; True delight energizes ongoing obedience, aligning with <a href="/psalms/119-14.htm">Psalm 119:14&#8211;16</a>, where the psalmist rejoices in God&#8217;s testimonies and meditates on His precepts.<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s example contrasts with superficial piety; his delight mirrors the greatest commandment to &#8220;love the Lord your God with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah</b><p>Delight in God led to decisive action. Idolatrous sites, though culturally entrenched, directly violated God&#8217;s clear commands (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; High places were local worship sites often mixed with pagan practices. Even when used for sacrifices to the LORD, they represented disobedience because worship was to be centralized in Jerusalem (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Asherah poles honored a fertility goddess, introducing moral compromise and spiritual confusion (<a href="/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing them meant confronting popular tradition. Similar reforms were later undertaken by Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence matters: inward delight produced outward reform. Jehoshaphat illustrates <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>&#8212;faith shown by works&#8212;and <a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>, where love for God equals obedience to His commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a> presents a seamless link between heart and action.
