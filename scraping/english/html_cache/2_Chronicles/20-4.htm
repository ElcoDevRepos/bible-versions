Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom of Israel, and its people often faced threats from surrounding nations. The act of gathering signifies unity and a communal approach to seeking divine intervention. In biblical context, seeking the LORD often involved prayer, fasting, and repentance, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>. This gathering reflects a deep reliance on God, acknowledging His sovereignty and power to deliver them from their enemies.<p><b>and indeed, they came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him</b><br>This part emphasizes the widespread participation of the people, indicating that the call to seek the LORD was heeded by individuals from various locations within Judah. The mention of "all the cities" suggests a national movement, transcending local boundaries and uniting the kingdom in a common purpose. Geographically, Judah was a region with diverse terrain, from the hill country to the coastal plains, and this collective movement underscores the urgency and seriousness of the situation. This unity in seeking God can be paralleled with other biblical events, such as the gathering at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and the assembly in Jerusalem during King Josiah's reforms (<a href="/2_kings/23.htm">2 Kings 23:1-3</a>). It also foreshadows the unity of believers in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, where the early church gathered in one accord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his efforts to follow God and lead his people in righteousness.

shows deliberate, united action; they do not wait to be compelled.<p>- Similar national assemblies occurred under Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-13.htm">2 Chronicles 30:13</a>).<p>- When God&#8217;s covenant people assemble, He promises His presence (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to seek the LORD</b><p>- Seeking is purposeful pursuit, not casual curiosity (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>).<p>- They turn to God first, before drawing battle plans (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-9</a>).<p>- &#8220;Seek&#8221;
