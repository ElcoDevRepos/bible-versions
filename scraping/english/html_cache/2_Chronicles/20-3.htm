This alarm reflects a natural human response to danger, highlighting the vulnerability even of a king. Historically, Judah was often caught between larger powers, making it susceptible to invasions. Jehoshaphat's alarm is a reminder of the constant threats faced by the kingdom of Judah during this period.<p><b>and set his face to seek the LORD.</b><br>In response to his fear, Jehoshaphat turned to God, demonstrating his faith and reliance on divine intervention. This phrase indicates a deliberate and determined action, showing Jehoshaphat's commitment to seeking God's guidance and help. The act of seeking the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the importance of turning to God in times of trouble. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where seeking God often leads to deliverance and blessing.<p><b>And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.</b><br>Fasting in the biblical context is a spiritual discipline used to humble oneself before God, often accompanying prayer and repentance. By proclaiming a fast, Jehoshaphat united the people of Judah in a collective act of humility and dependence on God. This communal fast underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for divine intervention. Fasting is seen throughout Scripture as a way to seek God's favor, as in the cases of Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament practice of fasting as a means of spiritual focus and preparation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah during this time, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and strengthen the kingdom spiritually and militarily.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, over which Jehoshaphat reigned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fast.htm">The Fast</a></b><br>A spiritual discipline called by Jehoshaphat for the people of Judah to seek divine intervention in the face of an impending threat from a coalition of enemy armies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_fear_with_faith.htm">Responding to Fear with Faith</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's initial reaction to fear was to seek the Lord.

Jehoshaphat turns from military strategy to spiritual priority. Compare <a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>, where the same resolve marks another leader in exile.<p>&#8226; Seeking the Lord is more than a quick prayer; it implies reliance, inquiry, and surrender (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>).<p>&#8226; His resolve recalls God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>, &#8220;If you seek Him, He will be found by you.&#8221; Jehoshaphat acts on that very promise, confident in the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He proclaimed a fast throughout Judah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah.&#8221; (20:3c)<p>&#8226; The king calls the entire nation to unified humility.

This collective turning sets the stage for the miraculous victory that follows (20:22&#8211;24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a> shows a king who meets fear with faith-filled action. Alarmed by overwhelming odds, Jehoshaphat deliberately pivots to seek the Lord and invites the entire nation to join him through fasting. His example underscores how God&#8217;s people should respond to crisis&#8212;honestly acknowledging fear, fixing their hearts on the Lord, and uniting in humble dependence&#8212;confident that the God who hears will act.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And Jehoshaphat.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he was afraid</span> (scil., at the news). <span class= "ital">And Jehoshaphat set his face,</span> &c.
