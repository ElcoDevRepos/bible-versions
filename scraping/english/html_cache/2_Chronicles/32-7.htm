It is a call to trust in God's power and presence, emphasizing reliance on divine strength rather than human might. The phrase is a recurring biblical theme, encouraging believers to face challenges with faith and confidence in God's promises.<p><b>Do not be afraid or discouraged</b><br>Fear and discouragement are common human responses to overwhelming circumstances. This command reassures the people of Judah that their situation is under divine control. Similar encouragements are found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God promises His presence and support.<p><b>before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him</b><br>The Assyrian Empire was a dominant military power during this period, known for its brutal conquests and advanced warfare tactics. King Sennacherib's campaign against Judah was part of his broader strategy to expand Assyrian control. The historical context highlights the real and present danger faced by Hezekiah and his people, making the call to faith even more significant.<p><b>for there is a greater One with us than with him</b><br>This statement affirms the presence and superiority of God over any earthly power. It parallels the assurance given by Elisha in <a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16</a>, where he tells his servant not to fear the Aramean army because "those who are with us are more than those who are with them." This reflects the biblical truth that God's power surpasses all human strength, a theme also seen in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" It foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over all spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who reigned during the time of the Assyrian threat.
