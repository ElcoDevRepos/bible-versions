The roasting over fire can be seen as a type of Christ's suffering, as fire often represents judgment and purification in Scripture. The adherence to regulation underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands, reflecting the Israelites' commitment to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and they boiled the other holy offerings in pots, kettles, and bowls</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the preparation of additional offerings that were part of the Passover celebration. The boiling of these offerings in various vessels indicates the practical aspects of preparing large quantities of food for the people. The use of pots, kettles, and bowls suggests a communal effort and the importance of hospitality and provision during the feast. This practice aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, which allows for the consumption of other sacrifices during the festival, emphasizing the communal and celebratory nature of Passover.<p><b>and quickly brought them to all the people</b><br>The swift distribution of the offerings to the people demonstrates the efficiency and organization of the Levites and priests during the Passover. This act ensured that everyone could partake in the meal, reflecting the inclusivity and unity of the community in worship. The phrase also highlights the role of the Levites as servants of the people, facilitating their worship and participation in the feast.
