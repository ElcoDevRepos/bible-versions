Manasseh, known for his idolatry and evil practices, finally turns to God in humility. This reflects the biblical principle that God is always willing to listen to a repentant heart, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear from heaven if His people humble themselves and pray.<p><b>the LORD received his plea and heard his petition</b><br>This demonstrates God's mercy and readiness to forgive, even the most wayward individuals. The Hebrew word for "received" implies acceptance, showing that God does not hold grudges against those who genuinely repent. This is consistent with God's character throughout the Bible, as seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the father eagerly receives his repentant son.<p><b>So He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom</b><br>This phrase indicates a physical and spiritual restoration. Historically, Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians, and his return to Jerusalem signifies God's power to restore not only individuals but also their circumstances. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of restoration, as seen in the return of the Israelites from Babylonian exile (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>).<p><b>Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God</b><br>This marks a profound transformation in Manasseh's understanding and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. It signifies a personal revelation and acceptance of God's authority, similar to Nebuchadnezzar's realization in <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>. This acknowledgment is crucial in the biblical narrative, as it aligns with the first commandment to have no other gods before the LORD (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially led the nation into idolatry and evil practices but later repented and turned back to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is merciful and responsive to genuine repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where Manasseh was restored to his kingdom after his repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_captivity.htm">Assyrian Captivity</a></b><br>Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians, which led to his repentance and subsequent restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>The central event where Manasseh's sincere prayer led to his restoration by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance can lead to restoration, no matter how far one has strayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy_and_forgiveness.htm">God's Mercy and Forgiveness</a></b><br>God's mercy is greater than our sins; He is willing to forgive when we genuinely seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer.htm">The Importance of Prayer</a></b><br>Prayer is a powerful tool for change and restoration in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_sovereignty.htm">Recognizing God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Acknowledging that "the LORD is God" is crucial in our spiritual journey and relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_trials.htm">Transformation through Trials</a></b><br>Difficult circumstances can lead us to a deeper understanding and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_33_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 33:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_33_13_shows_God_s_forgiveness.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:13 demonstrate God's willingness to forgive and restore?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Manasseh_s_actions_for_God_s_compassion.htm">What actions did Manasseh take that led to God's compassion in 2 Chronicles 33:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Manasseh_s_repentance_today.htm">How can we apply Manasseh's repentance to our own lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_examples_of_mercy_post-repentance.htm">What other biblical examples show God's mercy after genuine repentance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_authority_on_daily_life.htm">How does recognizing God's authority impact our daily decisions and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_33_13_shows_God_s_forgiveness_2.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:13 demonstrate God's willingness to forgive even the worst sinners?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Manasseh_s_repentance_power_of_humility.htm">What does Manasseh's repentance in 2 Chronicles 33:13 teach about the power of genuine humility?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_33_13_vs_unforgivable_sins.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 33:13 challenge the belief that some sins are unforgivable?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_33.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_manasseh's_repentance.htm">How do we reconcile Manasseh&#8217;s repentance in 2 Chronicles 33:13 with 2 Kings 21, which does not mention his conversion or release from captivity at all? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_king_amon_of_judah.htm">Who was King Amon of Judah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/ark_to_jerusalem__before_or_after_philistines.htm">When did David bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem?
