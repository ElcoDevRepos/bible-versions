This age suggests a level of maturity and readiness for leadership, as he would have been well-prepared by his father, who was a successful king until his later years. The age of twenty-five is significant in biblical terms, often associated with the beginning of service or leadership, as seen with the Levites who began their service at this age (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>). Jotham's ascension at this age indicates a transition from the co-regency with his father, who was struck with leprosy and thus unable to fulfill his duties fully (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem</b><br>Jotham's reign in Jerusalem underscores the city's centrality as the political and spiritual heart of Judah. Jerusalem, the city of David, was not only the capital but also the location of the Temple, the center of worship for the Israelites. Jotham's rule from Jerusalem signifies continuity in the Davidic line, fulfilling God's promise to David of an enduring dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The city's strategic location and fortifications, which Jotham himself improved (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3-4</a>), highlight its importance in maintaining the security and prosperity of the kingdom.<p><b>sixteen years</b><br>Jotham's sixteen-year reign is noted for its stability and relative peace, especially compared to the tumultuous periods before and after his rule. His reign is characterized by obedience to God, as he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>). This period allowed for significant building projects and fortifications, contributing to the strength and security of Judah. The length of his reign, while not as long as some of his predecessors, was sufficient to leave a positive impact on the kingdom, setting a standard for his successors. His reign is a reminder of the blessings of faithfulness to God, as seen in the prosperity and peace that Judah experienced during his time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jotham was the son of Uzziah and became king of Judah.

This precision underscores how the Lord directs the seasons of a person&#8217;s life (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Twenty-five is young enough to show energy yet old enough to show maturity. David was thirty when he began to reign (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>); Josiah was only eight (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-1.htm">2 Chronicles 34:1</a>); Uzziah, Jotham&#8217;s father, was sixteen (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a>). The variety reminds us that God equips each servant in His timing (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jotham had already served as co-regent while Uzziah was isolated with leprosy (<a href="/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a>), so this transition was orderly, displaying God&#8217;s preference for stability among His covenant people (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple statement affirms the historical reliability of Scripture; the chronicler is not recording legend but verifiable facts (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-8.htm">2 Chronicles 27:8</a>b) highlights both duration and location. Jerusalem&#8212;the city where God chose to place His Name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>)&#8212;remained the political and spiritual center of Judah.<p>&#8226; Sixteen years is moderate when compared with other kings: Uzziah ruled fifty-two years (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a>), Hezekiah twenty-nine (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-1.htm">2 Chronicles 29:1</a>), and Ahaz, Jotham&#8217;s son, likewise sixteen (<a href="/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2</a>). Longevity alone is not the measure of success; faithfulness is. Jotham &#8220;grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-6.htm">2 Chronicles 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His reign was marked by building projects and military victories (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3-5</a>). These accomplishments flowed from personal integrity&#8212;he &#8220;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (27:2). Such linkage between obedience and blessing echoes promises like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-8</a>.<p>&#8226; That the account lists no major spiritual failures sets Jotham apart from many predecessors (contrast <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>; 28:19). His sixteen years illustrate how a comparatively brief life of steady faithfulness can leave a lasting impact (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/27-8.htm">2 Chronicles 27:8</a> offers more than a date stamp; it shows God&#8217;s sovereign timing and Jotham&#8217;s steady tenure in the covenant city. At twenty-five, he stepped into leadership already shaped by prior service. For sixteen years he reigned with integrity, demonstrating that a life anchored in obedience&#8212;no matter its length&#8212;advances God&#8217;s purposes and blesses His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He was five and twenty years old.</span>--A word for word repetition of <a href="/2_kings/15-33.htm" title="Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
