His actions were pivotal in overthrowing the usurper Queen Athaliah and reinstating the rightful king, Joash. The making of a covenant signifies a formal and solemn agreement, often seen in the Old Testament as a renewal of commitment to God. This act echoes the covenants made by leaders like Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7-8</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a>), emphasizing the importance of covenantal faithfulness in Israel's history.<p><b>between himself and the king</b><br>Jehoiada's covenant with the king, Joash, underscores the alliance between religious and royal authority in Judah. This partnership was essential for ensuring that the king would rule in accordance with God's laws. The high priest's influence over the young king highlights the role of spiritual leaders in guiding political figures, reminiscent of Samuel's relationship with King Saul and King David (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1, 16</a>:13).<p><b>and the people</b><br>The inclusion of the people in the covenant signifies a communal commitment to follow the LORD. This reflects the collective responsibility of the nation to uphold God's commandments, as seen in previous covenants where the entire assembly of Israel was involved (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10-15</a>). It emphasizes the idea that the spiritual health of the nation depends on the faithfulness of all its members, not just its leaders.<p><b>that they would be the LORD&#8217;s people</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people, a theme central to the Old Testament narrative (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). It is a call to return to the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where Israel was set apart to be a holy nation. This renewal of identity is crucial in the context of Athaliah's reign, which had led the people away from true worship. The covenant serves as a rededication to live according to God's statutes, foreshadowing the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where believers are called to be a holy people (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in the restoration of the Davidic line to the throne of Judah.

His timing&#8212;&#8220;Then&#8221;&#8212;marks a decisive spiritual turning point, not merely a political one (compare <a href="/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>). The priest&#8217;s leadership reminds us that genuine reform begins in the household of God (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>) and that spiritual authority must guide civil authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Made a covenant</b><p>Covenant language echoes Mount Sinai and every renewal moment in Israel&#8217;s history.

Such a covenant is never a casual agreement; it is solemn, public, irrevocable. Like Josiah generations later, Jehoiada seeks not cosmetic reform but heart-deep allegiance (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-31.htm">2 Chronicles 34:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Between himself</b><p>Jehoiada places himself first in the covenant list, modeling personal accountability. Spiritual leaders do not stand above the covenant&#8212;they stand inside it (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>). He refuses to call others to a commitment he will not embrace himself, echoing Samuel&#8217;s earlier charge, &#8220;As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the king</b><p>King Joash, though young, is brought under divine obligation alongside the priest (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-2.htm">2 Chronicles 24:2</a>). The throne is accountable to God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10&#8211;12</a>). A ruler&#8217;s authority remains legitimate only when surrendered to the higher King (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). This covenant ties political power to spiritual fidelity, ensuring the monarchy serves God&#8217;s purposes rather than personal ambition (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the people</b><p>The entire nation signs on&#8212;no spectators, no exemptions (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24</a>). Faith in Scripture is always communal. Renewal spreads horizontally: families, tribes, neighborhoods. By including &#8220;the people,&#8221; Jehoiada affirms that holiness cannot be outsourced; every heart must turn (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-12.htm">2 Chronicles 15:12</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That they would be the LORD&#8217;s people</b><p>The goal is identity restoration. After years of Baal worship under Athaliah, Judah reclaims its calling: &#8220;For you are a holy people to the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). To be &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s people&#8221; means exclusive loyalty, daily obedience, and visible distinction from surrounding cultures (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16&#8211;18</a>).
