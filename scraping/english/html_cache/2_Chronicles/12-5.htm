Prophets in Israel served as God's messengers, often delivering warnings or guidance. Rehoboam, the king of Judah, was facing a crisis due to his earlier decision to increase the burdens on the people, which led to the division of the kingdom. The leaders of Judah were gathered, indicating a council or assembly to address the threat posed by Shishak, the king of Egypt. This gathering in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, underscores the gravity of the situation.<p><b>who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak</b><br>Shishak, also known as Sheshonq I, was the first king of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt. His invasion of Judah is historically corroborated by Egyptian records, including a relief at the Karnak Temple. This event occurred around 925 BC, shortly after the division of the united monarchy. The gathering at Jerusalem highlights the city's significance as a fortified refuge and a place of decision-making. Shishak's campaign is seen as a divine judgment against Judah for their unfaithfulness.<p><b>and he said to them, &#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase "This is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, emphasizing that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. It underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. The use of the covenant name "LORD" (YHWH) reminds the audience of their special relationship with God, which they have neglected.<p><b>&#8216;You have forsaken Me;</b><br>This accusation points to the spiritual apostasy of Judah under Rehoboam's leadership. Forsaking God often involved idolatry and neglect of the covenantal laws given through Moses. The spiritual decline began with Solomon's later years and continued under Rehoboam, as the people turned to other gods and practices contrary to the covenant.<p><b>therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The principle of divine retribution is evident here: as Judah forsook God, He allowed them to face the consequences of their actions. Being "forsaken" into the hand of Shishak implies military defeat and subjugation. This reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the seriousness of covenant faithfulness and the reality of divine judgment. This event foreshadows the ultimate exile of Judah, pointing to the need for a faithful king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeys and restores the covenant relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah_the_prophet.htm">Shemaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>A prophet of God who delivered messages to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah.
