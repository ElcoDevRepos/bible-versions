The preparation of the service aligns with the detailed instructions given in the Law of Moses (Exodus 12), emphasizing the need for obedience to God's commands. This preparation also highlights the role of leadership in ensuring that worship is conducted properly, as seen in the reforms of King Josiah, who sought to restore true worship in Judah.<p><b>the priests stood in their places</b><br>The priests, descendants of Aaron, had specific roles in the temple service, including offering sacrifices and maintaining the sanctuary. Their standing in their designated places signifies readiness and dedication to their sacred duties. This orderliness is reminiscent of the organization seen in the wilderness tabernacle (Numbers 3-4), where each priestly family had specific responsibilities. The priests' role as mediators between God and the people foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and the Levites in their divisions</b><br>The Levites, distinct from the priests, assisted in various temple functions, including music, teaching, and maintaining the temple grounds. Their division into groups for service reflects the structured worship system established by David (1 Chronicles 23-26). This organization ensured that the temple service was continuous and efficient. The Levites' role in teaching the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>) underscores the importance of God's Word in worship and daily life.<p><b>according to the king&#8217;s command.</b><br>King Josiah's command underscores his commitment to restoring proper worship in Judah, as he sought to align the nation's practices with the covenantal laws. His reforms were part of a broader movement to return to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>. Josiah's leadership in this religious revival is a testament to the impact of godly leadership and the importance of adhering to divine instructions. His actions also fulfill the prophecy of a king from David's line who would restore true worship (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), pointing ultimately to the messianic reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored the observance of the Passover as described in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron responsible for performing the sacrifices and rituals in the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi who assisted the priests and were responsible for various duties in the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Josiah reinstated with great zeal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites where the Passover was celebrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Josiah's adherence to the instructions for the Passover demonstrates the importance of following God's Word precisely.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership.htm">Role of Leadership</a></b><br>Josiah's leadership was crucial in guiding the nation back to proper worship, showing the impact of godly leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The organized roles of priests and Levites highlight the importance of unity and order in communal worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revival_and_reform.htm">Revival and Reform</a></b><br>Josiah's actions serve as a model for spiritual revival and reform, emphasizing the need for returning to foundational truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_continuity.htm">Historical Continuity</a></b><br>Observing the Passover connects the people of Judah to their historical and spiritual heritage, reminding believers of the importance of remembering God's past deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_35_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 35:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_35_10_Orderly_worship_s_value.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 35:10 demonstrate the importance of orderly worship practices?
