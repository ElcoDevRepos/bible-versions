The imagery of God's eyes roaming suggests His active and constant surveillance over the world. This is reminiscent of <a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>, where it is stated that God&#8217;s eyes are on the ways of man. The concept of God&#8217;s eyes roaming is also found in <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, indicating His watchfulness and care. This phrase assures believers that nothing escapes God's notice, and He is aware of all actions and intentions.<p><b>to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's desire to support and empower those who are loyal to Him. The phrase implies a covenant relationship, where God actively intervenes in the lives of the faithful. This is seen in the lives of biblical figures like David, who was described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The idea of God showing Himself strong is also a reminder of His mighty acts in history, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt. The call for full devotion echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, urging believers to love God with all their heart.<p><b>You have acted foolishly in this matter</b><br>This rebuke is directed at King Asa, who relied on a foreign alliance rather than seeking God's help. The term "foolishly" in biblical context often refers to a lack of spiritual insight or failure to trust in God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>. Asa's actions contrast with his earlier reliance on God during the battle against the Cushites (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>). This serves as a warning against self-reliance and the importance of seeking divine guidance.<p><b>From now on, therefore, you will be at war.</b><br>The consequence of Asa's lack of faith is ongoing conflict. This reflects the biblical principle that disobedience and lack of trust in God can lead to turmoil, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah. The wars Asa faced can be seen as both literal and spiritual, symbolizing the inner and outer struggles that arise from turning away from God. This serves as a reminder of the peace that comes from trusting in God, as promised in <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially trusted in God but later relied on human alliances.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanani_the_seer.htm">Hanani the Seer</a></b><br>A prophet who rebuked King Asa for relying on the king of Aram instead of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by Asa during this time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A neighboring kingdom with which Asa formed an alliance, demonstrating a lack of trust in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose omniscience and omnipresence are emphasized in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_omnipresence.htm">God's Omniscience and Omnipresence</a></b><br>God is fully aware of all that happens on earth.

Like the seven eyes in <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a> that &#8220;range throughout the earth,&#8221; these words assure us that the Lord is never absent or distracted.<p>&#8226; We are never hidden&#8212;our motives, fears, and loyalties are all plainly before Him.<p>&#8226; His oversight is not cold surveillance; it is the caring scrutiny of a Father who desires to bless.<p>&#8226; Because He sees everything, He alone is qualified to judge rightly (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To show Himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to Him</b><p>The purpose of His searching eyes is gracious: God actively looks for people to defend and empower. Second Chronicles 14:11 records how Asa once relied on that power when facing a million-man army, and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15&#8211;17</a> shows the same principle in Jehoshaphat&#8217;s day.<p>&#8226; Whole-hearted devotion means undivided trust, like the &#8220;whole heart&#8221; exhorted in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a>.<p>&#8226; When we lean on Him, His strength becomes ours, echoing <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>: &#8220;those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The promise is personal and practical&#8212;He intervenes, provides, heals, and protects (<a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have acted foolishly in this matter</b><p>The prophet confronts Asa for turning from reliance on God to an alliance with Ben-Hadad of Aram (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2&#8211;3</a>). In Scripture, &#8220;foolish&#8221; often describes choices that ignore God&#8217;s wisdom, as in <a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a> when Saul disobeyed.<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s earlier victories came through faith; now his pragmatism reveals a divided heart.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a> warns, &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The rebuke exposes the real issue: not strategy but trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From now on, therefore, you will be at war</b><p>Because Asa shifted his confidence from the Lord to human politics, he forfeited peace. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> teaches that we reap what we sow, and <a href="/numbers/14-43.htm">Numbers 14:43</a> shows Israel losing battles when they moved without God.<p>&#8226; Dependence on self invites ongoing conflict, anxiety, and loss.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s discipline is corrective, urging us back to reliance on Him (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s later years, marked by disease and stubbornness (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>), illustrate the sad trajectory of continued self-reliance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a> reveals a God who watches the whole earth, eager to display His limitless power for believers whose hearts are undivided. Asa&#8217;s story warns that even past victories do not exempt us from the need for present trust. Choosing human solutions over divine help is folly that leads to turmoil. Wholehearted devotion invites God&#8217;s strong arm; divided allegiance invites war. The verse calls us to trust fully, live transparently, and experience the strength God delights to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For the eyes of the Lord.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">For Jehovah, his eyes run, &c.</span> Run to and fro (comp. <a href="/job/1-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you?
