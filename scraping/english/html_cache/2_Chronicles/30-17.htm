Many of these attendees had not undergone the necessary purification rituals required by the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-14</a>). This highlights the spiritual neglect and apostasy that had occurred during the reigns of previous kings, leading to a lack of adherence to religious practices.<p><b>the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs</b><br>The Levites, set apart for religious duties, were responsible for assisting in the temple services (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5-10</a>). Their involvement in slaughtering the Passover lambs underscores their role as mediators between God and the people, especially when the people themselves were not ceremonially clean. This act also emphasizes the importance of proper ritual observance in worship.<p><b>for every unclean person</b><br>Uncleanness in the Old Testament often referred to a state of ritual impurity, which could result from various causes such as contact with a corpse, certain diseases, or failure to follow purification laws (Leviticus 11-15). The presence of unclean individuals at the Passover indicates a broader invitation to return to God, despite their current state, reflecting God's grace and the inclusivity of Hezekiah's reforms.<p><b>to consecrate the lambs to the LORD</b><br>Consecration involves setting something apart for a sacred purpose. The Levites' role in consecrating the lambs signifies the dedication of the Passover sacrifice to God, ensuring it was acceptable and holy. This act points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who was consecrated for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The Passover lamb serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing His redemptive work on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated the celebration of the Passover, seeking to restore proper worship and obedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties, who assisted in the Passover by slaughtering the lambs for those who were unclean.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing redemption and God's covenant with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the Passover was celebrated, representing the heart of spiritual renewal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assembly.htm">Assembly</a></b><br>The gathered people of Israel and Judah, including those who had not properly consecrated themselves, highlighting the inclusivity of Hezekiah's reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_consecration.htm">The Importance of Consecration</a></b><br>Consecration is essential for worship.

Many respond, but some arrive without the required purification.<p>&#8226; Consecration is non-negotiable for participation in sacred worship (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>). Those who skipped it were ceremonially &#8220;unclean&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah, eager for national repentance and unity, allows them to come anyway, trusting God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that sincere hearts may still fall short of God&#8217;s standards, highlighting our ongoing need for cleansing through the provision He supplies (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs</b><p>&#8226; God assigned Levites to handle holy duties (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5&#8211;10</a>). In earlier reforms under Hezekiah, priests were too few, so Levites stepped up (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The Passover lamb had to be slain &#8220;at twilight&#8221; by representatives of each household (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>). Because many worshipers were unclean, Levites performed the task on their behalf, ensuring the ritual met divine specifications.<p>&#8226; This foreshadows Christ, our sinless Substitute, whose death fulfills Passover (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for every unclean person</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Unclean&#8221; covers ritual impurity&#8212;anything from recent contact with a corpse to neglecting prior purification rites (<a href="/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6&#8211;14</a> shows God already had a provision: an additional Passover in the second month for the ceremonially unqualified. Hezekiah&#8217;s assembly is precisely that &#8220;second month&#8221; observance (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace is evident: God welcomes the unworthy when they humble themselves and accept His ordained means of cleansing (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to consecrate the lambs to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The slaughter itself did not make the people holy; it set apart (&#8220;consecrated&#8221;) the lambs as an offering pleasing to God.<p>&#8226; By handling the sacrifice, the Levites transferred ceremonial purity onto what would be eaten, allowing the people to share in covenant fellowship (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, holiness comes from the Lord&#8217;s provision, not from human effort. The verse underscores substitutionary atonement: a clean mediator stands between a holy God and an unclean people (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17</a> records God&#8217;s compassionate workaround during Hezekiah&#8217;s Passover: many attended unprepared, yet the Levites&#8212;set apart for holy service&#8212;slaughtered the lambs on their behalf so everyone could worship in purity. The verse teaches that while God&#8217;s standards never change, He graciously provides cleansing through an appointed mediator, ultimately pointing to Christ, the true Passover Lamb who makes the unclean clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">There were many in the congregation that were not sanctified.</span>--Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/35-6.htm" title="So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brothers, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">2Chronicles 35:6</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/35-10.htm" title="So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.">2Chronicles 35:10-11</a>, where the Levites are again represented as doing the same work, but not as an exception.
