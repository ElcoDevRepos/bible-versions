His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh. Jehoshaphat's name means "Yahweh has judged," reflecting his role as a leader who sought to align his kingdom with divine justice. His reign is detailed in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/17.htm">2 Chronicles 17-20</a>, where he is depicted as a king who sought to follow the ways of David, his ancestor, by removing high places and Asherah poles, and sending out officials to teach the Law of the Lord.<p><b>had returned safely</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jehoshaphat had been away from Jerusalem, likely due to his involvement in the battle at Ramoth-gilead alongside Ahab, king of Israel. Despite the dangerous alliance with Ahab, Jehoshaphat's safe return signifies divine protection and mercy. The battle is described in <a href="/2_chronicles/18.htm">2 Chronicles 18</a>, where Ahab is killed, but Jehoshaphat is spared, highlighting God's providence and the king's ultimate reliance on God despite his political missteps.<p><b>to his home in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was not only the political center but also the spiritual heart of the nation, housing the Temple built by Solomon. Jehoshaphat's return to Jerusalem symbolizes a return to the center of worship and governance. Jerusalem holds significant biblical importance as the city of David and the future site of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. The city's name means "foundation of peace," which is fitting as Jehoshaphat's reign was marked by relative peace and prosperity, attributed to his faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and for his reforms to bring the people back to God.

<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that God&#8217;s providence governs not only great miracles but also the ordinary turn of a calendar day (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By noticing this timing, we see how God often uses moments right after a crisis to teach, correct, and redirect His people (<a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>; <a href="/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10&#8211;3</a>:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat king of Judah</b><p>The spotlight falls on the man himself.<p>&#8226;

Physical preservation often precedes spiritual confrontation. Jehu the seer will soon meet the king with rebuke (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>), showing that God spares us not merely for comfort but for correction (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This safe return prefigures the believer&#8217;s ultimate security in Christ&#8212;rescued from peril to live for righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his home in Jerusalem</b><p>The destination matters.<p>&#8226; Jerusalem, the city where God chose to place His Name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>), serves as the spiritual center of Judah&#8217;s worship.<p>&#8226; Coming home positions Jehoshaphat to resume covenant leadership, cleanse idolatry, and appoint godly judges (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows the believer&#8217;s true homecoming: citizenship in the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1</a> is more than a travel note.
