His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. The thirty-sixth year marks a significant point in his reign, as it was a time of both political and spiritual challenges. This period is approximately 875 BC, during the divided monarchy when Israel and Judah were separate kingdoms.<p><b>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah</b><br>Baasha was the third king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, ruling from approximately 909 to 886 BC. His reign was characterized by conflict with Judah, as he sought to consolidate power and expand his influence. The animosity between Israel and Judah was rooted in the division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign, leading to frequent hostilities.<p><b>and fortified Ramah</b><br>Ramah was a strategically located town in the territory of Benjamin, near the border between Israel and Judah. By fortifying Ramah, Baasha aimed to control a critical access point, effectively cutting off trade and communication between the two kingdoms. Archaeological evidence suggests that Ramah was a significant military and administrative center during this period.<p><b>to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah</b><br>Baasha's actions were a direct threat to Judah's economic and political stability. By blocking movement, he sought to weaken Asa's reign and force Judah into submission. This tactic reflects the broader geopolitical strategies of ancient Near Eastern kings, who often used sieges and blockades to exert pressure on rival states. The conflict between Asa and Baasha is also a reminder of the ongoing struggle for power and control in the region, which is a recurring theme throughout the historical books of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his initial faithfulness to God and religious reforms, but later faltered in his reliance on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>King of Israel, who sought to weaken Judah by fortifying Ramah, a strategic location.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, strategically important as it controlled access to Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, ruled by Asa, often in conflict with the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, ruled by Baasha, frequently at odds with Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complacency.htm">The Danger of Complacency</a></b><br>Asa's early reign was marked by faithfulness, but over time, he became complacent and relied on human alliances rather than God.

Up to this point the kingdom of Judah had enjoyed &#8220;no war until the thirty-fifth year&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-19.htm">2 Chronicles 15:19</a>).<p>- Those peaceful decades followed Asa&#8217;s wholehearted reforms&#8212;tearing down idols and encouraging covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-2.htm">2 Chronicles 14:2&#8211;5</a>; 15:8&#8211;15).<p>- By noting the specific year, the chronicler reminds us that even long seasons of blessing can be interrupted when God allows a new test of faith (compare <a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a> with 16:7&#8211;9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah</b><p>- The northern king Baasha had already clashed with Asa; &#8220;there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>- Baasha&#8217;s aggression flowed from political insecurity. Earlier, the prophet Jehu had announced that Baasha&#8217;s dynasty would be wiped out because he &#8220;walked in the way of Jeroboam&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>). Facing judgment, Baasha struck at Judah in hopes of bolstering his own position.<p>- This move also challenged the promise the Lord had made to preserve David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), setting the stage for divine intervention that follows in the chapter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fortified Ramah</b><p>- Ramah sat about five miles north of Jerusalem on the main north-south route (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>). Whoever held Ramah controlled trade, travel, and military movement.<p>- Baasha&#8217;s fortification was more than building walls; he was turning Ramah into a military checkpoint that could choke Judah. <a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17</a> records the same act: &#8220;Baasha king of Israel went up and built Ramah.&#8221;<p>- The site later appears as a place of exile processing (<a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>) and lament (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), underscoring its strategic and symbolic weight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah</b><p>- The blockade targeted both commerce and worship. After Asa&#8217;s reforms, &#8220;many from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon defected to him when they saw that the LORD his God was with him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>). Baasha wanted that flow of people&#8212;and their tithes&#8212;stopped.<p>- The tactic echoes Jeroboam&#8217;s earlier fear that pilgrimages to Jerusalem would turn hearts back to David&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/12-27.htm">1 Kings 12:27</a>).<p>- By sealing the border, Baasha aimed to squeeze Judah economically and spiritually, hoping Asa would capitulate. Instead, Asa sought help from Ben-hadad of Aram (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2&#8211;3</a>), a choice the prophet Hanani later rebuked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> records a calculated act of aggression: in Asa&#8217;s thirty-sixth year, Baasha seized the choke point of Ramah to strangle Judah&#8217;s trade and worship traffic. The verse marks the sudden end of long-enjoyed peace, introduces the northern king&#8217;s attempt to undermine God&#8217;s covenant people, and sets up Asa&#8217;s critical decision about where to place his trust. The historical details, geographical note, and stated motive together affirm the literal accuracy of Scripture while pointing forward to the spiritual lesson that reliance on the Lord&#8212;not political maneuvering&#8212;secures true security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XVI.<p>THE WAR WITH BAASHA</span>--(<a href="/context/2_chronicles/16-1.htm" title="In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">2Chronicles 16:1-6</a>).<p>Comp. <a href="/context/1_kings/15-17.htm" title="And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.">1Kings 15:17-22</a>.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up.</span>--According to <a href="/1_kings/15-33.htm" title="In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.">1Kings 15:33</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm" title="In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.">1Kings 16:8</a>, Baasha began to reign in the third year of Asa, reigned twenty-four years, and died in the twenty-sixth year of Asa. These statements are obviously irreconcilable with that of our verse. We must suppose either that the chronicler has accepted a different calculation from that of the Kings--a calculation which he may have found in one of his documents; or that the text here is unsound, and thirty-six has been substituted by an error of transcription for sixteen, or twenty-six; and that in <a href="/2_chronicles/15-19.htm" title="And there was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:19</a> by a similar mistake thirty-five has taken the place of fifteen or twenty-five. Upon the whole, the latter alternative appears preferable; and if we assume twenty-five and twenty-six to be the correct numerals, we get the following chronology for the reign :--First, ten years of peace (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-1.htm" title="So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.">2Chronicles 14:1</a>), during which Asa strengthened his defences (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6-8</a>); then the invasion of Zerah, at what precise date is not clear, but at some time between the eleventh and the fifteenth year (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm" title="And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.">2Chronicles 14:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); then the reformation of religion and renewal of the covenant in Asa's fifteenth year (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-10.htm" title="So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.">2Chronicles 15:10</a>); and lastly, another ten years of peace, until the outbreak of the war with Baasha, in the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - For the <span class="cmt_word">six and thirtieth</span> <span class="cmt_word">year,</span> <span class="accented">read six and twentieth. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Ramah</span> belonged to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21, 25, 28</a>), and lay between Bethel and Jerusalem, about five or six Roman miles from each; but Keil and Bertheau, by some error, call it thirty miles from Jerusalem, having very likely in their eye Ramah of Samuel, in Ephraim. The word signifies "lofty," and the present history speaks the importance of its position, and would infer also that Israel had regained Bethel, which, with other adjacent places, Abijah had wrested from Jeroboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>). The reference of <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28, 29</a>, 82 is exceedingly interesting, and bespeaks the fact that Ramah commanded another intersecting route from Ephraim.
