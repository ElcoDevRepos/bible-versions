Joash's reign began with promise, as he was guided by the priest Jehoiada, but after Jehoiada's death, Joash turned away from God, leading to his downfall. The conspiracy against him was a result of his abandonment of the covenant with God and his subsequent actions, which included the murder of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada. This act of betrayal by his own servants highlights the theme of divine retribution and justice found throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess</b><br>Zabad, one of the conspirators, is identified as the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel, representing foreign influence and idolatry. The mention of his mother's nationality may suggest the infiltration of foreign religious practices and cultural influences into Judah, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of Israel's struggle with idolatry and the influence of surrounding nations.<p><b>and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess</b><br>Jehozabad, another conspirator, is the son of Shimrith, a Moabitess. The Moabites, like the Ammonites, were often adversaries of Israel and associated with pagan worship. The inclusion of Moabite lineage emphasizes the theme of foreign influence and the dangers of alliances with those outside the covenant community. This connection to Moab also recalls the story of Ruth, a Moabitess who became an ancestor of David, highlighting the complexity of Israel's relationships with neighboring peoples and the potential for redemption and inclusion within God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zabad.htm">Zabad</a></b><br>One of the conspirators against King Joash.

Yet many MSS. of Kings read "Joza-bad." "Shomer" in Kings should probably be Shemer (<a href="/1_chronicles/7-32.htm" title="And Heber begat Japhlet, and Shomer, and Hotham, and Shua their sister.">1Chronicles 7:32</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-34.htm" title="And the sons of Shamer; Ahi, and Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram.">1Chronicles 7:34</a>), of which Shimri (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-37.htm" title="And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;">1Chronicles 4:37</a>) and Shimrith might be by-forms. Reuss is incorrect in asserting that the names of the <span class= "ital">mothers</span> are substituted by the chronicler for the names of the <span class= "ital">fathers.</span> Thenius even knows the reason why the chronicler has added the epithets "Ammonitess," "Moabitess." The writer wished to show that the idolatry into which he makes Joash lapse (?), was avenged by two sons of idolatrous wives (!). This is fancy determined by prejudice. The additions "Ammonitess," "Moabitess," indicate the use of another source than the canonical book of Kings; and the same may be said of the strikingly original account of the death of Zechariah (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/24-17.htm" title="Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king.
