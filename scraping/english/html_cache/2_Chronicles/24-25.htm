Their withdrawal indicates a temporary retreat or cessation of hostilities, possibly due to achieving their immediate military objectives or other strategic reasons. This event follows their invasion, which was a divine judgment against Judah for their unfaithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23-24</a>). The Arameans' presence and actions were part of God's plan to discipline His people, as seen in other instances where foreign nations were used as instruments of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><b>they left Joash severely wounded</b><br>Joash, the king of Judah, was left in a vulnerable state, both physically and politically. His severe wounds symbolize the consequences of his departure from faithfulness to God. Joash's reign began with promise under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest, but after Jehoiada's death, Joash turned to idolatry and abandoned the temple of the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17-18</a>). His physical wounds reflect his spiritual decline and the resulting divine judgment.<p><b>His own servants conspired against him</b><br>The conspiracy by Joash's servants highlights the internal strife and discontent within his administration. This act of betrayal can be seen as a fulfillment of the principle that those who shed innocent blood will themselves face violence (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The servants' conspiracy was motivated by Joash's actions against Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, which had caused unrest and dissatisfaction among those loyal to the priestly line.<p><b>for shedding the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest</b><br>Joash's murder of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, was a grave sin that led to his downfall. Zechariah's death is a significant event, as he was a prophet who spoke against the people's idolatry (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>). This act of shedding innocent blood was a direct violation of God's commandments and a betrayal of the covenant relationship between the king and the priesthood. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's appointed leaders and the prophetic voice.<p><b>and they killed him on his bed</b><br>The assassination of Joash while he was on his bed indicates a cowardly and treacherous act, reflecting the depth of his betrayal by those closest to him. This manner of death contrasts with the honorable deaths of faithful kings and underscores the ignominy of Joash's end. It serves as a warning of the ultimate judgment that befalls those who forsake God's ways.<p><b>So he died and was buried in the City of David</b><br>Joash's burial in the City of David signifies his royal status, as this was the traditional burial place for the kings of Judah. However, his burial here does not imply honor, as the subsequent phrase clarifies. The City of David, located in Jerusalem, was a place of great historical and spiritual significance, being the site of King David's original fortress and the center of Jewish worship.<p><b>but not in the tombs of the kings</b><br>Joash's exclusion from the tombs of the kings indicates a lack of honor and respect at his death. This exclusion was a significant statement by the people of Judah, reflecting their disapproval of his actions and his failure to uphold the covenant with God. It serves as a stark contrast to the honor given to Jehoiada, who was buried among the kings for his faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-16.htm">2 Chronicles 24:16</a>). This distinction underscores the biblical theme that true honor comes from obedience to God and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>A group of people from Aram (modern-day Syria) who attacked Judah and left Joash severely wounded.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A godly priest who mentored Joash and helped him restore the temple; his son was murdered by Joash.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_joash.htm">Servants of Joash</a></b><br>These individuals conspired against Joash and killed him as retribution for his actions against Jehoiada's son.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>The burial place of Joash, though he was not honored with a burial in the tombs of the kings due to his unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_counsel.htm">The Importance of Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Joash thrived under Jehoiada's guidance but faltered when he ignored godly counsel.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that the Lord governs history, avenges innocent blood, and withholds honor from those who dishonor Him, while still preserving His promises for the sake of His greater redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And when they were departed from him.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">were.</span> The Syrians retired, instead of besieging Jerusalem, as they had purposed to do.<p><span class= "bld">For they left him in great diseases.</span>--Some refer this to the wounds which Joash had received from the Syrians in battle. But it is not said that Joash himself was wounded, but only that the destruction of his princes and the defeat of his army were judgments upon him. The word rendered "diseases" (<span class= "ital">mah?l-yim</span>) only occurs here; but it is obviously a near synonym of the term used of the last sickness of Jehoram (<span class= "ital">tah?l-'im,</span> 2chron xxi, 19), and the probable meaning is "pains," or "suffering." Calamity may have brought about the sickness of Joash, or perhaps the invasion had come upon him when already prostrate with disease, and unable to resist in person.<p><span class= "bld">His own servants conspired against him.</span>--<a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm" title="And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goes down to Silla.">2Kings 12:20</a>, "And his servants arose and made a conspiracy."

See note above, and observe further that this parenthetic clause, as treated in both Authorized Version and Revised Version, prepares the way for what follows, and especially for the fact that it was <span class="cmt_word">on his bed that they slew him</span>.

These had the opportunity the rather at hand, in that he was so ill and in bed. That he died by the conspiring together of a couple of servants, whose foreign and heathen maternity is particularly recorded, was the more ignominious end for him, who had commanded Zechariah to be openly stoned - a death highly honourable in comparison. The parallel (<a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>) adds that it was in "the house of Mille, which goeth down to Silla" (for the explanation of which passage, see note <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), that the servants' conspiracy to kill Joash took effect. The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word "sons." We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand.
