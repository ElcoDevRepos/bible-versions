In lieu of the italic type "<span class="accented">certain"</span> here, the English idiom, "years after," would aptly reproduce the facts of the case. This journey to Samaria to see Ahab was made in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign (<a href="/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a> and <a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). What were the precise antecedent circumstances of this visit of Jehoshaphat to Ahab it is interesting to surmise - whether it were the fruit of an invitation direct from Ahab, who had his own designs, or whether it were for diplomatic reasons, that worked in the mind of Jehoshaphat as well as of Ahab, in view of Syria. It is evident that Ahab promptly determined to improve this conference of kings. <span class="cmt_word">Persuaded him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps to induce him.

The form is the hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, in which conjugation only the verb occurs. The Revised Version renders "moved." The visiting and cooperating of Jehoshaphat and Ahab made a novel departure in the history of the rended kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and continued till the time of Jehu. <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth-Gilead</span>.
