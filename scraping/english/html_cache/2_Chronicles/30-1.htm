This phrase highlights his efforts to unify the divided kingdom, reaching out to both the southern kingdom of Judah and the northern kingdom of Israel. Historically, the kingdom had been split since the reign of Rehoboam, Solomon's son. Hezekiah's actions demonstrate a desire for national repentance and spiritual renewal. This outreach reflects the biblical theme of unity among God's people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, "How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity!"<p><b>and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh</b><br>Ephraim and Manasseh were prominent tribes in the northern kingdom of Israel. By addressing these tribes specifically, Hezekiah acknowledges their significance and seeks to bridge the gap between the divided kingdoms. This act of reaching out to the northern tribes is significant because it occurs after the Assyrian conquest of Israel in 722 BC, which led to the dispersion of many Israelites. Hezekiah's invitation is a call to return to the covenantal worship of Yahweh, reminiscent of the prophetic calls for repentance found in Hosea and Amos.<p><b>inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Hezekiah's invitation underscores the importance of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence and the focal point of Israelite worship. This invitation to Jerusalem is significant because it emphasizes the city as the spiritual center, fulfilling the Deuteronomic law that prescribes worship at the place God chooses (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>). It also foreshadows the eschatological vision of all nations coming to worship in Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>.<p><b>to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel</b><br>The Passover is a foundational feast in Israelite religion, commemorating the Exodus from Egypt and God's deliverance of His people. By calling for the observance of Passover, Hezekiah seeks to remind the people of their shared history and covenant with God. This observance is a call to remember God's faithfulness and to renew their commitment to Him. The Passover also serves as a type of Christ, who is referred to as "our Passover lamb" in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, symbolizing deliverance from sin through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and sought to restore the worship of Yahweh.

Returning to Jerusalem means renouncing counterfeit worship and embracing God&#8217;s appointed way.<p>&#8226; 2 Chron 30:10 reveals mixed responses&#8212;some mock, others humble themselves.

Hezekiah&#8217;s call is a return to the written standard.<p>&#8226; Prophetically, Passover points to Christ, &#8220;our Passover Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).

He employs both heralds and letters, honors God&#8217;s chosen worship center, and reestablishes covenant obedience. The verse underscores leadership that trusts Scripture&#8217;s authority, seeks national repentance, and offers unity under the LORD&#8217;s redeeming banner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XXX.<p>HEZEKIAH'S PASSOVER--THE ROYAL SUMMONS TO ALL ISRAEL FROM DAN TO BEER-SHEBA</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/30-1.htm" title="And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 30:1-12</a>).<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Sent to.</span>-- '<span class= "ital">al,</span> i.e., '<span class= "ital">el.</span> (<a href="/jeremiah/26-15.htm" title="But know you for certain, that if you put me to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.">Jeremiah 26:15</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm" title="And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?">Nehemiah 6:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Letters.</span>--'<span class= "ital">Igg?roth.</span> Apparently a word of Persian origin.

Some have sought to bring into the appearance of harmony the two first clauses of this verse by supposing that the former clause purports to say that Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah, and in particular letters in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh, the chief tribes of the northern kingdom and the Joseph tribes. Vers. 6 and 10, however, seem to dispose effectually of this offer of explanation; while another explanation, that the names of the two tribes are simply to be taken as equivalent to "all Israel," seems true, though, in fact, it may be to advance us no way at all. We should prefer in the difficulty, unimportant though it is, yet one facing us, rather to assume that the verse wishes to say that Hezekiah <span class="accented">sent</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> sent messengers, which prove to be the <span class="accented">runners</span>, rendered the "posts") to all Israel and Judah, and to Ephraim, Manasseh, and the rest of their allied tribes by implication, but not to Judah wrote letters also which were carried by the posts (.or runners). It is true that ver. 6 may negative even this conjecture for getting over the difficulty, but <span class="accented">not</span> necessarily no, for it only says that the posts went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters, which they may be supposed to have dropped only to some, not to all, and those some <span class="accented">Israel</span>, or Ephraim, Manasseh, and brethren. There will have been to hand other, the usual methods of communication with Judah, from Jerusalem its metropolis, and from its king. The thing <span class="accented">different from</span> "letters" that was circulated may have been just the "proclamation" of ver. 5. It has been suggested that the now King of Israel, Hoshea, was very probably a captive of Assyria at this exact time (<a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/30-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
