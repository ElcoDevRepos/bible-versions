The City of David is a term used for Jerusalem, specifically the oldest settled part of the city. The practice of preparing one's own tomb was common among the wealthy and powerful, indicating Asa's status and foresight. The City of David holds significant historical and archaeological importance as the original nucleus of Jerusalem, where many kings of Judah were buried. This burial practice reflects the honor and respect given to Asa, despite his later years of faltering faith.<p><b>They laid him on a bier that was full of spices and various blended perfumes;</b><br>The use of spices and perfumes in burial was a sign of great honor and respect, often reserved for royalty and the wealthy. This practice was meant to mask the odor of decay and was a common custom in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The mention of a bier, a platform for carrying the body, indicates a formal and ceremonial aspect to the burial. The use of spices and perfumes is reminiscent of the burial of Jesus Christ, as described in the Gospels, where myrrh and aloes were used (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39-40</a>), drawing a typological connection between Asa and Christ.<p><b>then they made a great fire in his honor.</b><br>The great fire likely refers to a large burning of spices and perfumes, a practice that signified mourning and respect. This was not a cremation, as cremation was not a common practice among the Israelites. Instead, it was a ceremonial act to honor the deceased. The fire symbolizes the high regard in which Asa was held by his people, despite his failures in the latter part of his reign. This act of honor reflects the cultural importance of memorializing leaders and the deep respect for the office of the king, even when the individual may have had personal shortcomings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.

The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime. The fact might have suggested Bishop Ken's lines in the evening hymn - <p>"<span class="accented">Teach me to live, that I may dread<br />The grave as little as my bed."</span> In the present instance, however, the writer, whoever he was (query, was he the compiler of our Chronicles, or his original?), is doubt-leas led to the analogy by considerations mere earthly than those enshrined in Ken's hymn, viz. by the somewhat "vain show" of attractiveness and fragrance (probably designed partly for preservative purposes) with which the place was filled, and which were among even patriarchal indications of faith in a future state. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet odours</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.
