The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of one's lineage. Rehoboam's reign was marked by conflict and division, as he failed to maintain the unity of the Israelite kingdom, leading to the split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. His death signifies the end of a turbulent reign and the transition to a new leadership.<p><b>and was buried in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the ancient part of the city that was originally captured by King David and established as the capital of Israel. Being buried in the City of David was an honor, signifying Rehoboam's royal status and his connection to the Davidic line. This burial place underscores the importance of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Judah. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of royal tombs in this area, although specific identifications remain debated. The City of David holds significant historical and theological importance, as it is associated with God's covenant with David and the promise of a lasting dynasty.<p><b>And his son Abijah reigned in his place.</b><br>Abijah, also known as Abijam in some biblical texts, succeeded Rehoboam as king of Judah. His reign is noted for its brief duration and continued conflict with the northern kingdom of Israel. The transition of power from Rehoboam to Abijah highlights the dynastic continuity of the Davidic line, despite the political instability of the period. Abijah's reign is further detailed in <a href="/1_kings/15.htm">1 Kings 15</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/13.htm">2 Chronicles 13</a>, where his military actions and religious policies are described. The mention of Abijah's succession emphasizes the ongoing narrative of the Davidic dynasty, which is central to biblical prophecy and the anticipation of a future messianic king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign was marked by division and conflict.

Despite Rehoboam&#8217;s failings, the chronicler affirms that the Lord had not abandoned the Davidic dynasty (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-7.htm">2 Chronicles 21:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers, the detail points forward to the ultimate Son of David&#8212;Jesus&#8212;whose tomb outside Jerusalem would remain empty, securing eternal life for all who believe (<a href="/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Abijah reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; The seamless transition to Abijah (called Abijam in <a href="/1_kings/15-1.htm">1 Kings 15:1</a>) reveals God&#8217;s faithfulness to maintain a ruler on David&#8217;s throne, even after judgment fell on Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-6.htm">2 Chronicles 12:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Abijah&#8217;s succession keeps the Messianic line intact (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-10.htm">1 Chronicles 3:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-7.htm">Matthew 1:7-8</a>) and sets the stage for God to display His power through weak vessels, as seen when Abijah later relied on the Lord for victory over Israel (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-4.htm">2 Chronicles 13:4-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly invites us to trust that, regardless of human inconsistencies, God&#8217;s larger salvation story cannot be derailed (<a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/12-16.htm">2 Chronicles 12:16</a> closes Rehoboam&#8217;s chapter and opens Abijah&#8217;s, emphasizing three truths: human leaders pass away, God&#8217;s covenant purposes remain, and His sovereign hand ensures the lineage leading to Christ continues unbroken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers.</span>--Abridged from <a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm" title="And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.

In the king's sepulchres eleven out of Judah's twenty-two kings were laid - David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Ahaziah, Amaziah, Jotham, Hezekiah, Josiah. For Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>) places of special honour were found.

Kings Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>) and Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm">2 Chronicles 24:25</a>) were buried in the "city of David," but not in the above sepulchres Uzziah, because a leper, was buried in the "field of the burial of the kings" (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-23.htm">2 Chronicles 26:23</a>).
