His decree marks a pivotal moment in Jewish history, allowing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem. This aligns with the biblical narrative of God using foreign rulers to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28 and 45</a>:1, where Cyrus is mentioned by name as God's anointed.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD, the God of heaven,</b><br>The title "God of heaven" reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty over all creation, a term often used in post-exilic texts. It underscores the universal authority of Yahweh, acknowledged even by a pagan king. This phrase indicates a shift in understanding God not just as a national deity but as the supreme ruler over all nations.<p><b>who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,</b><br>Cyrus attributes his conquests and authority to the providence of God, acknowledging that his power is granted by divine will. This reflects the biblical theme that God raises and deposes kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). It also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>, where God declares He will give all lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, and subsequently to Cyrus.<p><b>has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah.</b><br>Cyrus's decree to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>. The temple's reconstruction is central to Jewish worship and identity, symbolizing the restoration of the covenant relationship between God and His people. This act prefigures the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>Whoever among you belongs to His people,</b><br>This invitation is directed to the Jewish exiles, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people. It echoes the covenantal promise that God will gather His people from exile (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>). The phrase also highlights the inclusivity of God's call, extending beyond geographical boundaries.<p><b>may the LORD his God be with him,</b><br>This blessing invokes God's presence and favor upon those who choose to return. It reflects the biblical assurance of God's guidance and protection, reminiscent of God's promise to be with His people as they entered the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><b>and may he go up.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "go up" is often used in the context of pilgrimage to Jerusalem, signifying a return to spiritual and communal life centered around the temple. It symbolizes an ascent not just geographically but spiritually, as the people return to worship and serve God. This anticipates the ultimate gathering of God's people in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus_king_of_persia.htm">Cyrus King of Persia</a></b><br>The ruler who conquered Babylon and issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

Cyrus acknowledges God&#8217;s supremacy, credits Him for political power, and commissions the rebuilding of the temple, while blessing every Israelite willing to return. The verse is a powerful reminder that the Lord directs kings, keeps His promises, and invites His people into active partnership in His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath the Lord God of heaven given me... the Lord his God be with him</span>. The adopting by Cyrus of the Hebrew "Jehovah" in both these places cannot escape our notice. There can be no room to doubt that Cyrus was acquainted with the sacred literature of the Hebrews, and especially with the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as with the language of Daniel. It may have been partly a graceful act on the part of Cyrus to word his proclamation to the Jews thus, or it may have been simply, what under the circumstances came most naturally to him, with little or no intention in it either way. The numerous passages in Ezra parallel in matter with this verse do not need specification here. Now begins the new period of Jewish life, with fiercer probation, with unbounded and various trial, and probably of world-length continuance. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Cyrus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;
