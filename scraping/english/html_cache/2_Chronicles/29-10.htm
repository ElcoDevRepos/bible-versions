In the biblical context, the heart often represents the center of one's will and emotions. King Hezekiah, who is speaking here, demonstrates a sincere desire to lead the nation back to God. This reflects the biblical theme of God placing desires in the hearts of His people (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><b>to make a covenant with the LORD,</b><br>A covenant in biblical terms is a solemn agreement between God and His people. Hezekiah's intention to renew the covenant signifies a return to faithfulness and obedience. This echoes the covenants made with Abraham (Genesis 15), Moses (Exodus 19-24), and David (2 Samuel 7), emphasizing the importance of covenantal relationships in Israel's history.<p><b>the God of Israel,</b><br>This title emphasizes the unique relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It highlights God's faithfulness to His chosen people and their identity as His covenant community. The phrase underscores the continuity of God's promises from the patriarchs to the present time of Hezekiah.<p><b>so that His fierce anger</b><br>The mention of God's fierce anger reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry. In the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). It serves as a warning and a call to repentance.<p><b>will turn away from us.</b><br>This phrase indicates a desire for divine forgiveness and restoration. The turning away of God's anger is contingent upon repentance and covenant renewal. It parallels other instances in Scripture where God's wrath is averted through repentance, such as in the story of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Jesus Christ, who turns away God's wrath through His atoning sacrifice (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh.
