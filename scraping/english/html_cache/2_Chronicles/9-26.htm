Solomon's rule was marked by peace and prosperity, which allowed him to exert control over other regional kings. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would have a kingdom established in peace (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). Solomon's reign is a type of Christ's future reign, where Jesus will have dominion over all the earth (<a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8-11</a>).<p><b>from the Euphrates</b><br>The Euphrates River is one of the most significant rivers in the ancient Near East, often considered a natural boundary for the land promised to Israel (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Solomon's control extending to the Euphrates signifies the vastness of his kingdom, aligning with the territorial promises made to Abraham. This area was crucial for trade and military strategy, enhancing Israel's economic and political power.<p><b>to the land of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant group in the coastal region of Canaan, often at odds with Israel during the time of the Judges and early monarchy. Solomon's reign over this area indicates a period of subjugation and peace with former adversaries. This control over the Philistines demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to subdue Israel's enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>).<p><b>as far as the border of Egypt</b><br>Egypt was a powerful and influential neighbor to the south of Israel. Solomon's influence reaching the border of Egypt signifies a period of stability and diplomatic relations, as evidenced by his marriage alliance with Pharaoh's daughter (<a href="/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). This phrase underscores the extent of Solomon's peaceful reign, which allowed for alliances and trade with Egypt, further enriching Israel. Solomon's wisdom and wealth, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a>, prefigure the peace and prosperity of Christ's future kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Solomon was the son of King David and Bathsheba.

It symbolizes the extent of his influence and control.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who lived in the coastal region of Canaan. They were often in conflict with Israel, but during Solomon's reign, they were under his control.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful neighboring nation to the south of Israel.
