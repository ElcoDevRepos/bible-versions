This act of bringing out the king's son signifies the restoration of the Davidic covenant, which promised that David's descendants would rule Israel. Joash had been hidden in the temple for six years, symbolizing God's protection and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>put the crown on him</b><br>The crowning of Joash was a significant event, symbolizing the legitimate transfer of royal authority. The crown represents the divine right to rule, a concept deeply rooted in the Davidic covenant.

It highlights the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king is subject to God's authority.<p><b>and proclaimed him king</b><br>The public proclamation of Joash as king was essential for legitimizing his rule in the eyes of the people. This declaration was a formal acknowledgment of his rightful place as the ruler of Judah, in line with God's covenant with David. It also served to rally the people around their new king and restore order to the kingdom.<p><b>They anointed him</b><br>Anointing was a sacred act that set apart individuals for God's service, often associated with the Holy Spirit's empowerment. In the context of kingship, it signified divine approval and consecration for leadership. This act connects Joash to the tradition of anointed kings in Israel, such as Saul and David, and foreshadows the ultimate anointed one, the Messiah.<p><b>and shouted, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</b><br>This acclamation was a traditional expression of loyalty and support for the new king. It reflects the people's acceptance and celebration of Joash's ascension to the throne.

Each action&#8212;revealing the heir, crowning him, grounding him in Scripture, publicly proclaiming him, anointing him, and celebrating him&#8212;re-establishes the Davidic throne exactly as God promised. The verse reminds believers today that the Lord faithfully protects His redemptive plan, exalts His chosen King, and calls His people to align their lives under the authority of His unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span> So in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-14.htm" title="Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.
