His decision to send messengers indicates a diplomatic approach, common in ancient Near Eastern politics, to avoid unnecessary conflict. This reflects the political landscape where communication between nations was crucial to avoid misunderstandings and wars.<p><b>&#8220;What is the issue between you and me, O king of Judah?</b><br>This question highlights the lack of direct conflict between Egypt and Judah. Neco's inquiry suggests that he did not perceive Judah as an enemy, emphasizing the unnecessary nature of Josiah's opposition. Historically, Judah was a smaller kingdom compared to Egypt, and this question underscores the imbalance of power and the potential for unnecessary loss.<p><b>I have not come against you today,</b><br>Neco clarifies his intentions, indicating that his military campaign was not directed at Judah. This statement is crucial in understanding the broader geopolitical movements of the time, as Egypt was likely moving to support Assyria against the rising Babylonian empire.<p><b>but I am fighting another dynasty,</b><br>The "another dynasty" refers to the Babylonians, who were gaining power and threatening both Assyria and Egypt. This context is essential for understanding the strategic alliances and conflicts of the period, as Egypt sought to maintain a balance of power in the region.<p><b>and God has told me to hurry.</b><br>Neco claims divine instruction for his actions, a common assertion among ancient rulers to legitimize their campaigns. This statement introduces a theological dimension, suggesting that God&#8217;s will was perceived to be at work beyond the borders of Israel and Judah, challenging the exclusivity of divine guidance to the Israelites.<p><b>So stop opposing God, who is with me,</b><br>Neco's assertion that God is with him presents a theological challenge to Josiah, who was known for his religious reforms and dedication to Yahweh. This phrase suggests that God&#8217;s purposes can transcend national boundaries and that divine favor is not limited to Israel alone.<p><b>or He will destroy you!&#8221;</b><br>This warning serves as a prophetic statement, foreshadowing Josiah's demise in battle. It underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the consequences of opposing God's will, a recurring motif in the biblical narrative. Josiah's failure to heed this warning results in his death, illustrating the serious implications of disregarding divine messages.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/neco.htm">Neco</a></b><br>Pharaoh Neco II, the king of Egypt, who was on a military campaign against the Assyrians and sought to pass through Judah without conflict.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his religious reforms and dedication to God, who decided to confront Neco despite the warning.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by Josiah, which was geographically situated between Egypt and Assyria.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_message.htm">God's Message</a></b><br>The divine communication that Neco claimed to have received, instructing him to proceed with his campaign and warning Josiah not to interfere.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Josiah's failure to heed Neco's warning serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking God's guidance and discerning His will, even when it comes from unexpected sources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_presumption.htm">The Danger of Presumption</a></b><br>Assuming that one's own plans align with God's will without seeking confirmation can lead to disastrous consequences, as seen in Josiah's untimely death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_world_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in World Affairs</a></b><br>The passage illustrates that God can use even foreign rulers and nations to accomplish His purposes, reminding us of His ultimate control over history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god's_warnings.htm">Listening to God's Warnings</a></b><br>The importance of being attentive to God's warnings, regardless of the messenger, is crucial for avoiding unnecessary conflict and aligning with His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_decision-making.htm">Humility in Decision-Making</a></b><br>Josiah's account encourages leaders and believers to approach decisions with humility, recognizing that God's perspective may differ from our own.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_35_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 35:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_35_21_God_s_rule_over_all_kings.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 35:21 illustrate God's sovereignty over non-Israelite kings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Josiah_s_reply_to_Neco.htm">What can we learn from Josiah's response to Pharaoh Neco's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Pharaoh_Neco_s_warning_Romans_13_1_link.htm">How does Pharaoh Neco's warning relate to Romans 13:1 about authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Discern_God_s_voice_in_unexpected_ways.htm">How should we discern God's voice through unexpected sources, as in 2 Chronicles 35:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_heed_God_s_warnings_2.htm">What steps can we take to avoid ignoring God's warnings in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Josiah_ignore_Neco_s_message.htm">Why did King Josiah ignore Pharaoh Neco's message from God in 2 Chronicles 35:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_35_21_Divine_messages_unexpected.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 35:21 challenge the belief in divine messages through unexpected sources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_35_21_God_s_message_to_outsiders.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 35:21 reveal about God's communication with non-Israelite leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_35.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_2_sam_24_and_1_chr_21_differ.htm">Why do 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 differ in their attribution of who prompted David's census--God or Satan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_josiah_ignore_necho's_warning.htm">Why would Josiah ignore Necho&#8217;s explicit warning in 2 Chronicles 35:21 if it was truly from God?

God had no quarrel with Judah that day; He was moving Egypt to check another empire. Josiah&#8217;s intrusion turned him into an obstacle to the Lord&#8217;s plan, and the same God who once partnered with Josiah&#8217;s reforms now opposed his presumption. The verse teaches that God can speak through unexpected mouths, that even the most faithful believer must remain teachable, and that resisting God&#8217;s revealed direction&#8212;however it comes&#8212;invites needless ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">But</span> . . . <span class= "bld">ambassadors.</span>--<span class= "ital">And</span> . . . <span class= "ital">messengers.</span><p><span class= "bld">What have I to do with thee</span>?--Literally, <span class= "ital">what</span> <span class= "ital">to me and to thee? </span><span class= "greekheb">?? ???? ??? ???</span><span class= "ital">;</span> (LXX.; and <a href="/mark/5-7.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God?
