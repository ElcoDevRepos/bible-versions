In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, King Hezekiah is calling the people of Israel to return to the Lord and celebrate the Passover, which had been neglected. Setting one's heart on seeking God implies a deliberate and sincere effort to pursue a relationship with Him, reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>, which promises that those who seek God with all their heart and soul will find Him. This reflects the biblical principle that God desires a heartfelt commitment rather than mere ritualistic observance.<p><b>the LORD, the God of his fathers</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuity of faith and the covenant relationship between God and the people of Israel. The reference to "the God of his fathers" connects the current generation to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;and the promises made to them. It highlights the faithfulness of God across generations and serves as a reminder of the historical and spiritual heritage of the Israelites. This continuity is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing that the God worshiped by the forefathers is the same God who remains faithful to His people.<p><b>even if he is not cleansed according to the purification rules of the sanctuary</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the ceremonial laws that were central to worship in ancient Israel. The purification rules were detailed in the Mosaic Law, particularly in Leviticus, and were necessary for maintaining ritual purity. However, Hezekiah's prayer in this chapter reveals a deeper understanding of God's grace and mercy. It suggests that a sincere heart seeking God is more important than strict adherence to ritual purity, foreshadowing the New Testament teaching that faith and the condition of the heart are paramount (e.g., <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>). This anticipates the work of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers purification through His sacrifice, making it possible for all to approach God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms and called for the celebration of the Passover, inviting all of Israel to return to the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, including those from the northern tribes, who were invited to participate in the Passover despite their previous apostasy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Passover was celebrated, serving as the religious and political center of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_passover.htm">The Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, which Hezekiah sought to restore as a unifying act of worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, where the purification rules were to be observed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_over_ritual_compliance.htm">Sincerity Over Ritual Compliance</a></b><br>God values a heart that earnestly seeks Him more than strict adherence to ritualistic rules.

This encourages us to be inclusive and welcoming in our worship communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_repentance.htm">The Heart of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves setting one's heart on seeking God.

Rehoboam &#8220;did evil, because he did not set his heart to seek the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>). Setting the heart is the hinge on which obedience turns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On seeking God</b><p>&#8226; Seeking is active pursuit, not casual interest. Moses promised, &#8220;You will seek the LORD your God and you will find Him when you search with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>).<p>&#8226; David modeled this hunger: &#8220;My heart said of You, &#8216;Seek His face!&#8217; Your face, O LORD, I will seek&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> affirms that God rewards those &#8220;who earnestly seek Him.&#8221; Hezekiah is appealing to that divine promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD, the God of his fathers</b><p>&#8226; The phrase roots faith in covenant history. God introduced Himself to Moses as &#8220;the God of your father&#8212;the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah prayed, &#8220;LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known&#8230;that You are God in Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking &#8220;the God of his fathers,&#8221; Hezekiah highlights continuity: the same faithful Lord stands ready to receive the repentant northern tribes returning for Passover.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even if he is not cleansed</b><p>&#8226; Ritual uncleanness normally barred participation (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-7</a>). Yet grace makes room where the heart is right.<p>&#8226; Jesus later touched the leper, saying, &#8220;I am willing; be cleansed&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>), showing that inward faith supersedes ceremonial barriers.<p>&#8226; Peter learned, &#8220;What God has cleansed, you must not call common&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>). Hezekiah anticipates this gospel principle: sincere seekers can be forgiven though outwardly disqualified.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>According to the purification rules of the sanctuary</b><p>&#8226; The Law required strict observance for worshipers entering holy space (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Passover regulations even allowed a delayed observance for those unclean (<a href="/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10-11</a>), hinting that the heart mattered more than timing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> calls such regulations &#8220;external ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.&#8221; In Christ the deeper purification is provided, but the principle already shone through Hezekiah&#8217;s plea.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a> shows that God values a heart deliberately set on seeking Him more than flawless ritual compliance. Hezekiah appeals to the covenant-keeping Lord of Israel&#8217;s fathers, confident that humble, earnest worshipers will find forgiveness even when they fall short of ceremonial standards. The verse underscores grace without dismissing holiness, affirming that sincere pursuit of God opens the way to cleansing and fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">That prepareth.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hath directed.</span> The division of verses here is obviously incorrect.
