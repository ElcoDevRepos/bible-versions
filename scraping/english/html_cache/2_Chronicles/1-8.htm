This dialogue takes place at Gibeon, where Solomon had gone to offer sacrifices. The act of replying to God indicates a direct communication, emphasizing the personal relationship between Solomon and the divine. This interaction is reminiscent of other biblical figures who spoke directly with God, such as Moses and Abraham, highlighting Solomon's role as a chosen leader.<p><b>You have shown much loving devotion to my father David:</b><br>The phrase acknowledges God's covenantal faithfulness and mercy towards David, Solomon's father. This loving devotion, or "chesed" in Hebrew, is a central theme in the Old Testament, reflecting God's steadfast love and loyalty. David's relationship with God was marked by a deep bond, despite his failures, and God's promises to David included the establishment of his dynasty, which is fulfilled in Solomon's reign. This devotion is also a precursor to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<p><b>and You have made me king in his place:</b><br>Solomon recognizes that his kingship is not by his own doing but by divine appointment. This acknowledgment underscores the biblical principle that God is the ultimate authority who raises leaders according to His purposes. Solomon's ascension to the throne fulfills God's promise to David that his lineage would continue to rule Israel. This transition of power is significant in the history of Israel, as it marks the beginning of a prosperous era under Solomon's rule, known for wisdom and the building of the Temple. Solomon's kingship also foreshadows the eternal kingship of Christ, who reigns with wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.

God appears in the night and invites Solomon to ask for whatever he desires.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s very first move is conversation with the Lord, confirming the personal relationship David had modeled (<a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>) and that Solomon now embraces.<p>&#8226; His reply shows humility. Instead of boasting in royal privilege, he stands as a servant answering his Master (<a href="/1_kings/3-6.htm">1 Kings 3:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The fact that God initiates the dialogue underlines divine grace; Solomon&#8217;s words are a response, not a negotiation (<a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have shown much loving devotion to my father David</b><p>&#8226; Solomon begins with gratitude, not request. He rehearses God&#8217;s loyal love (&#7717;esed) toward David&#8212;love that protected him from Saul (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8&#8211;9</a>), sustained him in crises (<a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1-6</a>), and promised him an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By acknowledging this covenant faithfulness, Solomon affirms that the throne exists because God willed it, not because David earned it (<a href="/psalms/89-24.htm">Psalm 89:24-29</a>).<p>&#8226; He recognizes continuity: the same steadfast love that guarded David now anchors his own reign (1 Chron 28:7).<p>&#8226; This rehearsal of past mercy fuels confident expectation; if God has been faithful, He will remain faithful (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And You have made me king in his place</b><p>&#8226; Solomon attributes his elevation solely to God: &#8220;The LORD his God was with him and highly exalted him&#8221; (2 Chron 1:1).<p>&#8226; The peaceful transfer from David to Solomon fulfilled earlier promises: &#8220;Behold, a son will be born to you&#8230; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever&#8221; (1 Chron 22:9-10).<p>&#8226; This succession maintains the messianic line, keeping the covenant hope alive until it is ultimately realized in Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s wording also carries responsibility. Being placed &#8220;in his place&#8221; means continuing David&#8217;s God-centered priorities: justice (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>), worship (1 Chron 29:10-13), and obedience (<a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus his coming request for wisdom (2 Chron 1:10) aligns with God&#8217;s purpose: a ruler who shepherds the people in righteousness (<a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s brief statement in <a href="/2_chronicles/1-8.htm">2 Chronicles 1:8</a> is a model of God-focused perspective. He answers the Lord by:<p>1. Acknowledging the conversation as grace.<p>2. Celebrating the Lord&#8217;s covenant love to David.<p>3. Confessing that his own kingship is God&#8217;s doing.<p>By anchoring his reign in God&#8217;s past faithfulness, Solomon lays the groundwork for asking wisdom to serve well. The verse teaches that every new assignment from God is best approached with gratitude for yesterday&#8217;s mercies and dependence on His ongoing faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Thou, thou hast done great kindness with David.</span> (The regular phrase; comp. <a href="/luke/1-72.htm" title="To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;">Luke 1:72</a>.) From this point the relation here is briefer on the whole than that of Kings. The greater part of the long verse (<a href="/1_kings/3-6.htm" title="And Solomon said, You have showed to your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.">1Kings 3:6</a>) is omitted, and the variations between the two texts become numerous, though the general sense is the same in each.<p><span class= "bld">And hast made me to reign in his stead.</span>--Comp. <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm" title="And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.">1Kings 3:7</a>; and the similar language of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria (B.C. 681-668): "Ever since Asshur, Samas, Bel, Nebo . . . made me, Esarhaddon, sit securely on the throne of my father" (<span class= "ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia,</span> 3:15, Colossians 2).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father</span>. These also are the exact words found in the parallel place, but they omit the words, "thy servant," before "David," found there. <span class="cmt_word">And hast made me to reign in his stead</span>. This concise expression takes the place of two equivalent expressions, found at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh verses in the parallel passage, the former of which passages also describes it as "this great kindness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> kindness on the part of God - a description very much in harmony with David's own grateful acknowledgment to God (<a href="/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>).
