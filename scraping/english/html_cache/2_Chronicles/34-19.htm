The "words of the Law" likely refer to the Book of the Law, which was discovered in the temple during renovations. This book is generally considered to be a form of Deuteronomy or a collection of Mosaic laws. The discovery signifies a pivotal moment in Judah's history, as it highlights the neglect of God's commandments and the need for reform. The hearing of the Law underscores the importance of Scripture in guiding the moral and spiritual direction of the nation. This moment is reminiscent of the rediscovery of God's Word in other biblical narratives, such as the reading of the Law by Ezra in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8</a>.<p><b>he tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes is a traditional expression of grief, repentance, or distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel. This act by King Josiah signifies his deep sorrow and alarm upon realizing how far the nation had strayed from God's commandments. It is a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil and repentance. This response is consistent with other biblical figures who tore their garments in times of crisis or mourning, such as Job (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>).
