Judah, the southern kingdom, was known for its capital, Jerusalem, where the temple was located. This gathering reflects a common practice in times of crisis, where the community would come together to seek divine intervention. Historically, Judah was often under threat from surrounding nations, and such assemblies were crucial for maintaining morale and spiritual focus.<p><b>with their wives and children and little ones</b><br>The inclusion of families highlights the seriousness of the situation and the communal nature of worship and supplication. In ancient Israelite culture, family units were central to society, and their presence signifies a collective dependence on God. This also underscores the importance of teaching faith to the next generation, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to pass on God's commandments to their children.<p><b>were standing before the LORD</b><br>Standing before the LORD signifies a posture of reverence and readiness to receive divine guidance. This phrase suggests a physical presence at the temple, the dwelling place of God among His people, as described in <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>. The act of standing is symbolic of respect and attentiveness, indicating that the people were prepared to listen and respond to God's will. This scene foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers standing before God through Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>, where access to God is granted through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
