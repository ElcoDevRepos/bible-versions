Bulls were considered valuable and symbolized strength and wealth. This act was part of the purification and rededication of the temple under King Hezekiah, who sought to restore proper worship practices. The use of bulls in sacrifices is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>, where a bull is offered as a sin offering for the anointed priest.<p><b>and the priests took the blood and splattered it on the altar</b><br>The priests, descendants of Aaron, were responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals. The act of splattering blood on the altar was a critical component of the sacrificial system, symbolizing the purification and sanctification of the altar and the people. Blood, representing life, was seen as a means of atonement for sin (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This practice foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the atonement of humanity's sins.<p><b>They slaughtered the rams and splattered the blood on the altar</b><br>Rams were often used in burnt offerings and were considered a pleasing aroma to the Lord (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>). The repetition of the sacrificial act with different animals emphasizes the thoroughness of the purification process. Rams, like bulls, were valuable and symbolized dedication and submission to God. The use of rams in sacrifices is also seen in the binding of Isaac, where a ram was provided as a substitute (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>), prefiguring Christ as the substitutionary sacrifice.<p><b>And they slaughtered the lambs and splattered the blood on the altar</b><br>Lambs were commonly used in sacrifices, particularly in the Passover celebration, where a lamb without blemish was sacrificed to commemorate Israel's deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5-7</a>). The lamb is a significant type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), symbolizing innocence and purity. The repeated mention of blood being splattered on the altar underscores the importance of blood in the sacrificial system as a means of atonement and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who were responsible for performing the sacrifices and rituals as prescribed by the Law of Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_the_lord.htm">Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem where the sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_animals.htm">Sacrificial Animals (Bulls, Rams, Lambs)</a></b><br>These animals were used in the sacrificial system as offerings to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The structure in the temple where sacrifices were made, representing the place of meeting between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_atonement.htm">The Importance of Atonement</a></b><br>The shedding of blood in the Old Testament sacrifices points to the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.

By beginning with bulls, the most costly animals, Judah acknowledged the gravity of its previous unfaithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This sets the tone for the entire revival: cleansing must precede worship (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They slaughtered the rams and splattered the blood on the altar</b><p>&#8226; Rams were central to consecration rituals (<a href="/exodus/29-15.htm">Exodus 29:15-18</a>).

The imagery points forward to the greater Substitute who would come (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By repeating &#8220;splattered the blood,&#8221; the text stresses that every stage of worship depends on shed blood, anticipating &#8220;the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they slaughtered the lambs and splattered the blood on the altar</b><p>&#8226; Lambs evoke daily continual offerings (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>) and the Passover deliverance (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-13</a>).
