In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/20.htm">2 Chronicles 20</a>, King Jehoshaphat is facing a coalition of enemies, including the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites. The request for God to judge them is rooted in the belief that God is the ultimate judge who can deliver justice. This echoes the biblical theme of God as the righteous judge, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a> and <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where God is called upon to execute judgment on behalf of His people.<p><b>For we are powerless before this vast army that comes against us.</b><br>Jehoshaphat acknowledges the overwhelming odds against Judah, emphasizing their vulnerability and inability to defend themselves without divine help. This admission of powerlessness is a recurring theme in Scripture, where human weakness is contrasted with God's strength, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>. The vast army represents a formidable threat, highlighting the need for reliance on God rather than human strength or military might.<p><b>We do not know what to do,</b><br>This phrase captures a moment of uncertainty and desperation. It reflects the human condition of facing situations beyond one's control or understanding. In the biblical narrative, this is a call to seek divine wisdom and guidance, reminiscent of <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, which encourages believers to ask God for wisdom in times of need. It underscores the importance of humility and dependence on God for direction.<p><b>but our eyes are upon You.&#8221;</b><br>The focus shifts from the problem to God, indicating trust and faith in His ability to deliver. This act of looking to God is a demonstration of faith, similar to <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, which encourages believers to fix their eyes on Jesus. It signifies a turning away from fear and uncertainty towards hope and assurance in God's providence. This reliance on God is a central tenet of faith, emphasizing that deliverance and guidance come from Him alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who is leading his people in prayer during a time of crisis.
