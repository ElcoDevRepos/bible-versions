Hezekiah's reign is noted for his efforts to restore proper worship and adherence to the Law of God. Jerusalem, the capital city, was the religious and political center of Judah. The command to the people living there highlights the importance of the city in implementing religious reforms. This action reflects Hezekiah's commitment to re-establishing the covenant relationship between God and His people, as Jerusalem was the location of the temple, the heart of Jewish worship.<p><b>to make a contribution for the priests and Levites</b><br>The priests and Levites were responsible for the spiritual leadership and religious duties in Israel. The contribution mentioned here is likely a tithe or offering, which was a common practice to support those who served in the temple. This system of support is rooted in the Mosaic Law, where the tribe of Levi was set apart for temple service and did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). The contributions ensured that the priests and Levites could focus on their sacred duties without the distraction of providing for their own material needs.<p><b>so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD</b><br>The Law of the LORD refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain the laws and commandments given to Moses. The priests and Levites were tasked with teaching and interpreting these laws for the people. By ensuring their material needs were met, Hezekiah enabled them to fully dedicate themselves to their spiritual responsibilities. This devotion to the Law was crucial for maintaining the covenant relationship with God and ensuring the spiritual health of the nation. This phrase also echoes the New Testament principle found in <a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>, where the apostles sought to devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word, highlighting the timeless importance of spiritual leaders focusing on their primary calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship and adherence to the Law of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_jerusalem.htm">People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the city who were commanded to provide for the priests and Levites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for temple worship and teaching the Law, who were to be supported by the people's offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, central to the religious and political life of the nation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_the_lord.htm">The Law of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the divine instructions given to Israel, which the priests and Levites were to teach and uphold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_supporting_ministry.htm">The Importance of Supporting Ministry</a></b><br>Just as Hezekiah commanded the people to support the priests and Levites, Christians today are called to support their church leaders and ministries.
