The tribe of Dan was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, known for its craftsmanship and artistry, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-6.htm">Exodus 31:6</a>). Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city, was renowned for its skilled artisans and trade. This blend of backgrounds suggests a unique combination of skills and cultural influences, reflecting the collaboration between Israel and its neighboring nations during Solomon's reign.<p><b>He is skilled in work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple, blue, and crimson yarn, and fine linen.</b><br>The craftsman's expertise in various materials indicates a high level of artistry and technical knowledge. Gold and silver were precious metals used extensively in the Temple's construction, symbolizing purity and divinity (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). Bronze and iron were used for structural and decorative purposes, while stone and wood were foundational materials. The mention of purple, blue, and crimson yarn, along with fine linen, connects to the priestly garments and the Tabernacle's design (<a href="/exodus/28-5.htm">Exodus 28:5-6</a>), signifying royalty, priesthood, and holiness.<p><b>He is experienced in every kind of engraving and can execute any design that is given him.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the craftsman's versatility and creativity, capable of executing intricate designs. Engraving was a significant skill in ancient craftsmanship, used for both functional and decorative purposes. The ability to execute any design suggests a deep understanding of artistic principles and a capacity to bring visionary concepts to life, akin to the divine inspiration given to Bezalel and Oholiab in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-11</a>).<p><b>He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, your father David.</b><br>This collaboration between the craftsman and Solomon's workers, as well as those who served David, underscores the continuity and unity in the building of the Temple. David had laid the groundwork for the Temple's construction, gathering materials and planning its design (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-5</a>). The craftsman's role in working alongside these established artisans highlights the fulfillment of David's vision through Solomon, pointing to the Temple as a symbol of God's enduring covenant with Israel and a foreshadowing of the ultimate temple, Jesus Christ, who embodies the presence of God among His people (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman whose mother was from the tribe of Dan and father from Tyre.

"Bertheau explains," She was by birth a Danite, married into the tribe of Naphtali, became a widow, and as a widow of the tribe of Naphtali became the wife of a man of Tyre, by whom she had a son Huram. Thus two of the tribes of Israel could boast that on the mother's side Huram belonged to them." But in the Hebrew words "daughters of Dan" it is possible to see a corruption of the word NAPHTALI.<p><span class= "bld">Skilful.</span>--This epithet belongs to Huram, not to his Tyrian father.<p><span class= "bld">To work in gold.</span>--<a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm" title="He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass.

But the parallel gives the mother as a woman "of the tribe of Naphtali," and calls her a "widow." This must mean, either that she was a widow <span class="accented">now</span>, or that she was a widow when "the man of Tyre" married her. If this latter is the correct meaning, it has been suggested that, though the mother was really a woman of the daughters of Dan, yet the husband who, dying, left her a widow, was of the tribe of Naphtali, and that from this <span class="accented">she</span> became credited with belonging to that tribe. It would seem not altogether impossible that it may be intended to state, in a delicate way, that this remarkably able man was the natural son of the widow in question, "the man of Tyre" (not called <span class="accented">her husband</span>) being the father.
