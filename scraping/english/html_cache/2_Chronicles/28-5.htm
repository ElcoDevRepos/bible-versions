The "LORD his God" indicates a covenant relationship that Ahaz has violated. The "king of Aram" refers to Rezin, king of Syria, who historically allied with Pekah, king of Israel, against Judah. This event is part of the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Aram and Israel sought to pressure Judah into joining their coalition against Assyria. The deliverance into the hands of enemies is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often serving as a consequence of Israel's disobedience (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>).<p><b>who attacked him and took many captives to Damascus</b><br>The attack by Aram resulted in significant losses for Judah, with many captives taken to Damascus, the capital of Syria. This reflects the geopolitical tensions of the 8th century BC, where regional powers frequently clashed. The taking of captives was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving both as a means of weakening the enemy and as a source of labor and wealth. Damascus, a major city in the ancient Near East, was a center of Aramean power and culture.<p><b>Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel</b><br>The "king of Israel" refers to Pekah, who ruled the northern kingdom. This phrase underscores the compounded judgment on Ahaz, as he faces threats from both Aram and Israel. The northern kingdom of Israel, despite being related to Judah, often found itself in conflict with its southern neighbor. This internal strife among the Israelites is a recurring theme, highlighting the division and discord that followed the united monarchy of David and Solomon.<p><b>who struck him with great force</b><br>The phrase "struck him with great force" indicates the severity of the defeat inflicted by Pekah. This military defeat is a direct consequence of Ahaz's failure to trust in God and his reliance on foreign alliances, such as his appeal to Assyria for help (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>). The "great force" signifies not only the physical might of Israel's army but also the spiritual and moral implications of Ahaz's leadership failures.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that God remains sovereign over history, faithful to His Word, and committed to shaping His people&#8212;even through painful judgment&#8212;so they might return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE WAR WITH REZIN OF SYRIA AND PEKAH OF ISRAEL; OR, THE SYRO-EPHRAITE CAMPAIGN</span> (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus.

The chronicler purposes, not so much to describe a campaign, as to select those events of it which most conspicuously illustrate God's chastisements of the apostate Ahaz.

The <span class="accented">name</span> of this king (Rezin) does not appear in this chapter, but it does in the parallel, vers. 5,6, 9. <span class="cmt_word">They smote him</span>. A previous unsuccessful attempt of Rezin and Pekah is apparently passed over in our chapter (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>), while the contents of our present yeas must be understood to have its place just before the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel, and to be significantly confirmed by the contents of its following verse. <span class="cmt_word">They smote... carried away... brought</span>. These <span class="accented">plurals</span> strongly <span class="accented">indicate the</span> dialocation of sentences in compiled matter. They probably came from original sources, where the conjoined names of Rezin and Pekah had been the antecedents (see on this history, <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7, 8, 9</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Brought them to Damascus</span>. The mode of the first introduction of the name of Ahaz in connection with Damascus in the parallel (ver. 10) is a suggestive illustration of how these parallel but very various narratives proffer to piece themselves, and in <span class="cmt_word">a</span> wonderful manner clear their, whole subject of any possible taint of the "cunningly devised fable." <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude</span> of Judah's people had been <span class="cmt_word">carried captives</span> and "brought to Damascus." When the King of Assyria (parallel, ver. 9) came to the help of Ahaz, he struck a fierce and evidently decisive blow against Damascus and Rezin, and to Damascus," to meat" Assyria's king, Tiglath-Pileser, the very next verso tells us, Ahaz. went - little doubt to pay his bills, over which a decent veil of silence is thrown. <span class="cmt_word">He was also delivered into the hand</span>, etc. The form of this sentence, with its "also," and with its evidently tacked-on appearance, coupled with the conjunction "for" with which the following verso is dragged in, seems to give great probability to the idea, <span class="accented">first</span>, that the latter half of ver. 5 and all of ver. 6 find their real place before (say) the word "Damascus;" and secondly, that they are strictly and conterminously paralleled by the former part of ver. 5 parallel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
