Gold was a symbol of royalty and divinity, often used in the construction of sacred objects within the temple. The use of pure gold reflects the holiness and sanctity of the temple, as well as the wealth and resources available during Solomon's reign. The design of the lampstands may have been similar to the menorah described in <a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>, which was a central feature in the Tabernacle. The menorah is also a type of Christ, representing Him as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<p><b>and their lamps</b><br>The lamps on the lampstands were essential for providing light within the temple, symbolizing the presence of God and His guidance. In a spiritual sense, the lamps can be seen as a representation of the Holy Spirit, who illuminates the hearts and minds of believers. The continual burning of the lamps signifies the perpetual nature of God's presence and His eternal covenant with His people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>, where Jesus is depicted among the lampstands, symbolizing His presence among the churches.<p><b>to burn in front of the inner sanctuary</b><br>The inner sanctuary, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. The placement of the lampstands in front of the inner sanctuary highlights their role in illuminating the path to God's presence. This arrangement underscores the importance of light in worship and the need for spiritual illumination to approach God. The inner sanctuary was a place of restricted access, entered only by the high priest once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-34</a>), prefiguring Christ's role as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p><b>as prescribed</b><br>The phrase "as prescribed" indicates adherence to divine instructions, emphasizing the importance of following God's commands in worship. The detailed prescriptions for temple furnishings and rituals were given to ensure that worship was conducted in a manner pleasing to God. This obedience to divine instruction is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting the necessity of aligning human actions with God's will. The careful observance of these prescriptions reflects a heart of reverence and submission to God's authority, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-27) and later in the New Testament teachings on worship (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple in Jerusalem, following the instructions given by his father, David, and the plans inspired by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.
