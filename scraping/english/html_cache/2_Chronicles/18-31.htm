The chariot commanders were likely part of the Aramean army, which was fighting against Israel. This phrase highlights the confusion on the battlefield, as Jehoshaphat was mistakenly identified as Ahab. The presence of chariots indicates the military strength and technological advancement of the time, as chariots were a significant part of ancient warfare.<p><b>they said, &#8220;This is the king of Israel!&#8221;</b><br>The chariot commanders were under orders to target the king of Israel specifically, as Ahab was the primary enemy. This reflects the common ancient military strategy of targeting the leader to demoralize and disorganize the opposing forces. The confusion between Jehoshaphat and Ahab may have been due to similar royal attire or the positioning of Jehoshaphat in the battle.<p><b>So they turned to fight against him</b><br>The Aramean forces redirected their attack towards Jehoshaphat, believing him to be Ahab. This action demonstrates the intensity and chaos of ancient battles, where quick decisions were made based on limited information. It also underscores the danger Jehoshaphat faced due to his alliance with Ahab, which was politically motivated but spiritually questionable.<p><b>but Jehoshaphat cried out</b><br>Jehoshaphat's cry can be seen as a plea for divine intervention. Throughout his reign, Jehoshaphat is depicted as a king who sought the Lord, and his cry here is consistent with his character. This moment of desperation highlights the human tendency to seek God in times of crisis, and it serves as a reminder of the power of prayer.<p><b>and the LORD helped him</b><br>This divine intervention is a testament to God's faithfulness to those who seek Him. Despite Jehoshaphat's flawed alliance with Ahab, God responds to his cry for help. This reflects the biblical theme of God's mercy and willingness to deliver His people when they call upon Him, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>.<p><b>God drew them away from him</b><br>The phrase indicates a supernatural redirection of the enemy forces, emphasizing God's control over the events of the battle. This intervention not only saved Jehoshaphat but also demonstrated God's sovereignty and protection over Judah. It serves as a reminder of God's ability to alter circumstances for the benefit of His people, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of divine deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God, who allied himself with Ahab, the King of Israel, through marriage and military alliance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariot_commanders.htm">Chariot Commanders</a></b><br>Military leaders of the Aramean army, tasked with targeting the king of Israel during the battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervenes to protect Jehoshaphat when he cries out for help.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle_of_ramoth-gilead.htm">Battle of Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>The conflict where Jehoshaphat and Ahab joined forces against the Arameans, leading to the events of this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who disguised himself in battle, leaving Jehoshaphat exposed to danger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God is attentive to the cries of His people and intervenes in their time of need.

The Lord not only heard but actively diverted the enemy, proving His readiness to defend those who call on Him. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s sovereignty, pray instinctively, and rest in the assurance that He can turn any battlefield in favor of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - Comparing this and following verse minutely with the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/22-32.htm">1 Kings 22:32, 33</a>), the exact correspondence of the latter of each pair of verses only the more clearly points the significance belonging to the two clauses of foreign matter interposed so characteristically by the writer of Chronicles for his own unvarying special objects, viz. <span class="cmt_word">the Lord helped him;</span> and <span class="cmt_word">God moved them.</span> What the cry of Jehoshaphat was remains uncertain; whether a cry to his own bodyguard and soldiers, or a cry to those who were beginning "<span class="cmt_word">to compass him about as bees</span>," to let them know at any rate that he was not the king they sought, or whether most improbably, a cry to the Lord is meant. The cry fulfilled its purpose, and if Jehoshaphat <span class="accented">had</span> a sneaking love for Ahab (see the significant "love them," etc., of Jehu in second verse of next chapter), he evidently had not any idea of needlessly dying for him.
