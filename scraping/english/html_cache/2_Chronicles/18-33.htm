The archer, unnamed and seemingly random, acts without specific intent to target the king, yet his actions fulfill divine prophecy. This reflects the biblical theme that God can use even unintended actions to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord." The randomness of the shot underscores the futility of human plans against divine will, echoing the prophecy of Micaiah earlier in the chapter (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-16.htm">2 Chronicles 18:16-22</a>).<p><b>and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor</b><br>The precision of the arrow striking between the armor joints signifies the inevitability of God's judgment. Despite the king's protective gear, the arrow finds a vulnerable spot, illustrating that no human defense can thwart God's plans. This moment fulfills the prophecy against Ahab, the king of Israel, who had been warned of his impending doom. The armor, meant to protect, becomes a symbol of human reliance on physical strength rather than spiritual obedience. This incident parallels the story of David and Goliath, where David's faith, rather than armor, leads to victory (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>So the king said to his charioteer, &#8220;Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!&#8221;</b><br>The king's command to his charioteer reveals his recognition of the severity of his injury and his desire to escape the battlefield. This moment of vulnerability contrasts with Ahab's earlier defiance of prophetic warnings. The king's retreat signifies the collapse of his earthly power and the fulfillment of divine prophecy. Historically, chariots were symbols of military might, yet here, they become a vehicle for retreat, highlighting the futility of relying on worldly strength. This scene foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who, unlike Ahab, willingly submits to God's will, even unto death, for the salvation of humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab,_king_of_israel.htm">Ahab, King of Israel</a></b><br>Ahab was the king of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of God.

The arrow went through, or by the side of one of the actual articulations of the armour-mail worn. Ahab's direction to the chariot-driver at the spur of the first wounded moment to turn and carry him <span class="cmt_word">out of the host</span>, was evidently qualified, when he found that the wound was not immediately fatal. As the heat of the battle grew, and victory did not at once turn one way or the other, he was the more anxious to give the moral support of his presence to the last to his army, and, unable to stand by himself, he was supported by his own orders (so our rendering is not inconsistent with that in the parallel "<span class="accented">was stayed"</span> (<a href="/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) in the chariot till he died in the evening. Although the spirit of Ahab, and his fidelity to his own army, kingdom, and self, cannot but appear to advantage in these last incidents of his unworthy life, yet it is probable that they find their record here for the sake of giving clear statement to the fact, that in the chariot his life-bleed collected according to the saying of the parallel (ver. 35 compared with ver. 38). Note, therefore, particularly the truncated history of the writer of Chronicles in this instance. He, no doubt, consciously omitted, and with a purpose, his own usual purpose; but light is lost, and the cross light tends rather to misleading, except for that only correct user of Scripture, which teaches us to compare one Scripture with another, and balance one part against another - a thing easy to do in matters of fact, but too often forgotten in the weightier matter of doctrine. Here our eighteenth chapter closes, less the mention of the proclamation for the self-disbanding of Ahab's army (ver. 36 of the parallel chapter) which should fulfil the prophecy of our ver. 16, and less any mention of Ahab's burial, of the washing of his chariot in the pool of Samaria, of the dogs licking up of the blood there, and of his ivory house, etc. (vers. 37-40 of the parallel chapter). All of which omittings accord well with the one clear ecclesiastical and religious intent of the Chronicles, in place of the pursuit of matters of general and merely graphic historic interest, however charged with instruction they too might be. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/18-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However, a [certain] man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
