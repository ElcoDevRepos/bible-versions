The temple, originally built by Solomon, had fallen into disrepair due to neglect and idolatrous practices by previous kings. The "house of the LORD" signifies the central place of worship for the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a sacred space for God's presence. The act of placing the funds into the hands of supervisors highlights the organized and accountable approach to the restoration, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship. This mirrors the New Testament teaching on the responsible use of resources for God's work (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><b>who in turn gave it to the workmen</b><br>The supervisors, acting as intermediaries, distributed the funds to the skilled laborers. This delegation of responsibility underscores the collaborative effort required in the restoration process. The workmen, likely skilled artisans and laborers, were essential for the physical restoration of the temple. This reflects the biblical theme of the body of Christ, where different members have unique roles and gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). The emphasis on skilled workmen also connects to the construction of the tabernacle, where God endowed specific individuals with the skills needed for the task (<a href="/exodus/31.htm">Exodus 31:1-6</a>).<p><b>restoring and repairing the house of the LORD</b><br>The dual focus on "restoring" and "repairing" indicates both a return to the original state and the fixing of what was broken. This restoration was not merely physical but also spiritual, as it symbolized a return to proper worship and covenant faithfulness. The temple's restoration under Josiah is a type of Christ's work in restoring humanity to God, as Jesus is seen as the ultimate restorer and repairer of the breach between God and man (<a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>). The emphasis on the "house of the LORD" being restored also points to the future hope of a new temple, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, and ultimately fulfilled in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foremen.htm">Foremen</a></b><br>These were the supervisors or overseers responsible for managing the work on the temple.
