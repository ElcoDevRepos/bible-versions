In the ancient Near Eastern context, building a temple was a significant act, often seen as a way to house a deity. However, Solomon acknowledges that God cannot be confined to a physical structure. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>, where Solomon questions whether God can truly dwell on earth. It highlights the biblical theme of God's omnipresence and the inadequacy of human efforts to contain Him.<p><b>since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him?</b><br>The phrase emphasizes God's infinite nature, surpassing even the vastness of the heavens. The "highest heavens" refers to the concept of multiple heavens, a common belief in ancient cosmology, where the highest heaven is the dwelling place of God. This idea is also seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a> and <a href="/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>. It underscores the belief that God is beyond all creation, reinforcing His majesty and sovereignty.<p><b>Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him</b><br>Solomon's rhetorical question reveals his humility and awareness of his own limitations. Despite being a king, he acknowledges his unworthiness in the grand scheme of God's plan. This humility is a key characteristic of biblical leaders, as seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>). It serves as a reminder of the need for humility before God, regardless of one's earthly status.<p><b>except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?</b><br>This phrase highlights the primary function of the temple: a place for worship and sacrifice. In the Old Testament, sacrifices were central to Israel's relationship with God, serving as a means of atonement and worship. The temple was not just a physical structure but a spiritual center for the Israelites. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the sacrificial system (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>). The temple's role as a place of sacrifice points to the greater reality of Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of David, who is tasked with building the temple for the Lord.

God &#8220;does not live in temples made by human hands&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48&#8211;49</a>), yet He graciously allows His people to serve Him.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s admission prepares our hearts to remember that any ministry, offering, or act of service is first an act of grace from God toward us (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him?</b><p>Solomon grounds his humility in theology: the Creator is infinite. <a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a> declares, &#8220;Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By pointing to the &#8220;highest heavens,&#8221; Solomon stacks superlatives to underscore God&#8217;s transcendence (<a href="/psalms/113-4.htm">Psalm 113:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God is present everywhere at once, yet never confined. <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a> celebrates this same truth.<p>&#8226; Any building, no matter how ornate, can only symbolize His presence. When we gather for worship today, our sanctuaries function the same way: signposts, not containers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him</b><p>The king asks a second, deeper question: &#8220;Who then am I?&#8221; Even endowed with wisdom (<a href="/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10&#8211;12</a>) and resources, Solomon knows he is still a servant.<p>&#8226; This mirrors Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?&#8221; God often calls us beyond our capacities so we will depend on Him.<p>&#8226; Notice the contrast: the immeasurable God versus a finite man. Any sense of entitlement evaporates.<p>&#8226; For believers, this perspective fuels gratitude rather than pride when God chooses to work through us (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?</b><p>Solomon lands on the practical purpose: the temple will host sacrifices, the divinely appointed way for Israel to approach God (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> &#8211; 7).<p>&#8226; Sacrifices declare two truths simultaneously: God&#8217;s holiness demands atonement, and His mercy provides it (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The altar, not the architecture, is central. <a href="/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1&#8211;10</a> reflects on the tabernacle&#8217;s furnishings, emphasizing that they pointed forward to Christ, &#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Today, we no longer bring animal offerings, yet <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> urges us to present our bodies &#8220;as living sacrifices,&#8221; grateful that Jesus has fulfilled the system once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a> pulls back the curtain on Solomon&#8217;s heart as he embarks on a monumental task.

The verse combines awe, humility, and purpose: we marvel at God&#8217;s transcendence, acknowledge our smallness, and gladly serve in the roles He assigns&#8212;always remembering that the true glory belongs to Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">But who is able.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">who could keep strength?</span> (See <a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm" title="But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.">1Chronicles 29:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The heaven . . . cannot contain him.</span>--This high thought occurs in Solomon's prayer (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm" title="But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?">1Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-18.htm" title="But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!">2Chronicles 6:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Who am I then . . . before him?</span>--That is, I am not so ignorant of the infinite nature of Deity, as to think of localising it within an earthly dwelling.
