Manasseh and Ephraim were part of the Northern Kingdom, which had been conquered by Assyria in 722 BC. This action by Josiah suggests a reclaiming of spiritual authority over these lands, reflecting the Davidic ideal of a united Israel. Simeon, although geographically within Judah, had been somewhat isolated, and its inclusion here emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Josiah's reforms. This effort to purify worship aligns with the Deuteronomic law, which Josiah was committed to following after the discovery of the Book of the Law in the temple (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>).<p><b>as far as Naphtali</b><br>Naphtali was one of the northernmost tribes, indicating the extensive reach of Josiah's reforms. This area had been heavily influenced by Assyrian culture and pagan practices due to its proximity to foreign nations. Josiah's actions here demonstrate a commitment to eradicating idolatry and restoring the worship of Yahweh even in regions that had been under foreign control for a significant time. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic vision of a restored Israel, as mentioned in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee, the region of Naphtali.<p><b>and in the ruins around them</b><br>The mention of "ruins" suggests the desolation left by Assyrian conquest and the subsequent neglect of these areas. Josiah's reforms included not only the destruction of idolatrous altars but also the restoration of proper worship practices. This phrase highlights the physical and spiritual renewal Josiah sought to bring about. The ruins symbolize the broken state of Israel, both physically and spiritually, and Josiah's efforts can be seen as a type of Christ, who comes to restore and rebuild what is broken (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, named after Joseph's firstborn son.
