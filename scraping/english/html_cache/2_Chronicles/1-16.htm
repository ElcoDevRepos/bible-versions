Egypt was known for its horses, which were highly valued in the ancient Near East. This practice, however, contrasts with <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, where God instructed Israel's kings not to acquire many horses, especially from Egypt, to prevent reliance on military might over divine trust. Solomon's actions here foreshadow potential spiritual decline, as reliance on foreign alliances and military strength could lead to idolatry and away from dependence on God.<p><b>and Kue;</b><br>Kue, also known as Cilicia, was a region in modern-day Turkey. It was renowned for its horses and chariots, indicating Solomon's far-reaching trade connections. This reflects the prosperity and influence of Solomon's kingdom, as well as the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a nation of prominence. The mention of Kue also underscores the geopolitical landscape of the time, where trade routes connected various cultures and economies.<p><b>the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.</b><br>The involvement of royal merchants suggests an organized and state-controlled trade system under Solomon's administration. This indicates a centralized economy and the king's direct involvement in international trade, which contributed to the wealth and splendor of his reign. The use of merchants also implies a level of sophistication and bureaucracy in Solomon's government, aligning with the biblical portrayal of his wisdom and administrative skills. This system of trade and wealth accumulation, while showcasing Solomon's success, also serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for material wealth to lead to spiritual complacency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant ancient civilization located in Northeast Africa, Egypt was often a place of refuge or trade for Israel, though it also represented a place of bondage and idolatry in Israel's history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kue.htm">Kue</a></b><br>Also known as Cilicia, Kue was a region in what is now modern-day Turkey.
