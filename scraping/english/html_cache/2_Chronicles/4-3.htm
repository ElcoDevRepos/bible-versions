The rim is the upper edge of the basin, indicating that the decorative elements were placed just beneath the top, visible to those who approached. This placement highlights the importance of the design and its visibility to worshippers.<p><b>Figures of oxen encircled it</b><br>Oxen are significant in biblical symbolism, often representing strength and service. In the context of the Temple, they may symbolize the strength and stability of God's covenant with Israel. The use of oxen in the Temple's design also reflects the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where oxen were vital for farming and sacrifices.<p><b>Ten per cubit all the way around the Sea</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. The precision of "ten per cubit" indicates a meticulous design, emphasizing the order and beauty of God's creation. This detail reflects the care and craftsmanship involved in constructing the Temple, which was meant to be a dwelling place for God's presence.<p><b>Cast in two rows</b><br>The casting of the oxen in two rows suggests a sense of completeness and balance. This method of construction, using molten metal, was advanced for the time and demonstrates the resources and skill available during Solomon's reign. The dual rows may also symbolize the dual nature of God's covenant, encompassing both blessings and responsibilities.<p><b>As a part of the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the large basin used for ritual purification by the priests. It was a critical component of the Temple's function, symbolizing cleansing and preparation for service to God. The integration of the oxen into the Sea's design signifies the unity of form and function, where beauty and utility serve a divine purpose. This also prefigures the cleansing work of Jesus Christ, who provides purification for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple, including the crafting of the "Sea" or large basin described in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, built by Solomon as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>A large basin used in the temple for ceremonial washing, symbolizing purification and the cleansing power of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oxen.htm">Oxen</a></b><br>Symbolic figures cast around the Sea, representing strength and service, often associated with sacrifice and labor in biblical symbolism.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman who assisted Solomon in the construction of the temple, including the casting of the Sea and its decorations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity_and_cleansing.htm">Symbolism of Purity and Cleansing</a></b><br>The Sea represents the necessity of purification before approaching God.

The verse calls us to trust the Lord who surrounds us with strength and supplies everything needed for pure, devoted service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And under it was the similitude of oxen.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And a likeness of oxen</span> (figured oxen) <span class= "ital">under it around surrounding it, ten in the cubit encompassing the sea around: two rows</span> were <span class= "ital">the oxen, smelted in the smelting of it.</span> In the parallel passage (<a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1Kings 7:24</a>) we read: <span class= "ital">And wild gourds underneath its lip around surrounding it,"</span> &c., as here; <span class= "ital">two of rows</span> were <span class= "ital">the gourds, smelted in the smelting thereof.</span> The Hebrew words for "oxen" and "gourds" might easily be confused by a transcriber, and accordingly it is assumed by most commentators that the text of the chronicler has suffered corruption, and should be restored from that of Kings. But there seems no reason--unless we suppose that each writer has given an exhaustive description, which is clearly not the case--why the ornamental rows which ran round the great basin should not have included both features, small figures of oxen, as well as wild gourds. Reuss objects on the ground of the diminutive size of the axon ("ten in a cubit"); but such work was by no means beyond the resources of ancient art. (Comp. the reliefs on the bronze doors of Shalmaneser 11. (859-825 B.C. ); <a href="/1_kings/7-29.htm" title="And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.">1Kings 7:29</a> actually gives an analogous instance.) The word <span class= "ital">p?q?'im,</span> "wild gourds," only occurs in one other place of Kings, viz., <a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm" title="And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.">1Kings 6:18</a>. (Comp. <span class= "ital">paqq-'oth,</span> <a href="/2_kings/4-39.htm" title="And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.">2Kings 4:39</a>.) A copyist of Kings might nave inadvertently repeated the word from the former passage in <a href="/1_kings/7-24.htm" title="And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.">1Kings 7:24</a>. In any case it is sheer dogmatism to assert that "the copyists (in the Chronicle) have absurdly changed the gourds into oxen" (Reuss). The Syriac and Arabic omit this verse; but the LXX. and Vulg. have it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The similitude</span> <span class="cmt_word">of oxen.</span> The parallel gives simply "knops" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> flower-buds) in the room of this expression, and no word "similitude" at all, the characters spelling the word for "knops" being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and those for "oxen" being <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The presence of the word "similitude" strongly suggests that the circles of decoration under description showed the likenesses of oxen, not necessarily (as Patrick) "stamped" on the so-called knops, but possibly constituting them. For the ambiguous under it of our present verse the parallel says with definiteness, "under the brim of it." There is intelligibility, at all events, in the ornamentation being of these miniature oxen, presumably three hundred in the circle of the thirty cubits. The symbolism would harmonize with that which dictated the superposition of the enormous vase on twelve probably life-size oxen. There is a general preference, however, accorded to the opinion that the present text has probably been the result of some copyist's corruption, and that the text of the parallel should be followed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Below [the rim],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8478.htm">Strong's 8478: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bottom, below, in lieu of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">figures</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
