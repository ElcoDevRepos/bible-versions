In the context of ancient Israel, consecration involved rituals that symbolized purification and dedication. These offerings were part of the religious reforms initiated by King Hezekiah, who sought to restore proper worship in the temple. The act of consecration underscores the importance of holiness and purity in worship, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's people being set apart for His purposes (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><b>were six hundred bulls</b><br>Bulls were significant in ancient Israelite sacrificial practices, often used in burnt offerings and peace offerings. The number six hundred indicates the scale and seriousness of the offerings, reflecting a substantial commitment to restoring worship. Bulls, as larger and more valuable animals, symbolized strength and were often associated with atonement and reconciliation with God (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). This large number of bulls highlights the community's dedication to renewing their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and three thousand sheep</b><br>Sheep were commonly used in various types of offerings, including burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings. The number three thousand signifies abundance and the community's collective effort in the worship and rededication process. Sheep, being more numerous and accessible, allowed for widespread participation in the sacrificial system. This large quantity of sheep emphasizes the communal aspect of worship and the people's desire to return to faithful observance of God's laws. The use of sheep in sacrifices is also a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship.

Hezekiah has reopened and purified the temple (2 Chron 29:3&#8211;17). The word &#8220;And&#8221; shows continuity with the preceding joy and obedience that followed the cleansing. The narrative moves directly from the priests&#8217; readiness (v. 32) to the record of what was brought. Just as in <a href="/exodus/40-33.htm">Exodus 40:33&#8211;35</a>, once God&#8217;s house is put in order, the response is immediate worship and giving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The consecrated offerings</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;Consecrated&#8221; points to animals set apart exclusively for the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm">Leviticus 22:2</a>).<p>&#8211; In 2 Chron 29:31 the king invited the people to &#8220;bring sacrifices and thank offerings,&#8221; and they responded. These were not leftover possessions; they were holy gifts, surrendered in gratitude (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The offerings follow the pattern of <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2&#8211;4</a>, where daily and festival sacrifices remind Israel that worship must be regulated by God&#8217;s Word, not personal whim. By consecrating the animals, the people acknowledge the Lord&#8217;s ownership over everything (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were six hundred bulls</b><p>&#8211; The chronicler records an exact number, affirming this was a real historical event, not symbolic. Scripture&#8217;s precision underscores trustworthiness (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; Bulls were costly (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). Bringing six hundred demonstrates lavish devotion, echoing David&#8217;s challenge in 1 Chron 29:5, &#8220;Who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?&#8221;<p>&#8211; Bulls also signify atonement for leaders and the nation (<a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm">Leviticus 16:11</a>). After years of Ahaz&#8217;s apostasy (2 Chron 28:24), such a quantity highlights the seriousness of corporate repentance (<a href="/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And three thousand sheep</b><p>&#8211; Sheep were the staple sacrificial animal (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3&#8211;6</a>). Three thousand emphasizes the breadth of participation; this was not a token gesture but a widespread movement of hearts.<p>&#8211; The ratio&#8212;many more sheep than bulls&#8212;aligns with <a href="/leviticus/5-6.htm">Leviticus 5:6&#8211;7</a>, where lambs or goats provide access for ordinary worshipers. God made room for every Israelite, foreshadowing the inclusive call of <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221;<p>&#8211; Such abundance recalls Solomon&#8217;s dedication feast (<a href="/1_kings/8-62.htm">1 Kings 8:62&#8211;63</a>). The same God who once filled the temple with glory is receiving worship again, showing His mercy and readiness to restore (2 Chron 7:13&#8211;14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 33 records concrete numbers to spotlight genuine, measurable repentance and joyful generosity after the temple&#8217;s purification. Six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep, consecrated to God, testify that when hearts are turned back to Him, costly and abundant worship follows. The detail assures us of Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability and calls us to respond with the same wholehearted devotion today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">The consecrated things.</span>--That is, the victims for the thank-offerings.
