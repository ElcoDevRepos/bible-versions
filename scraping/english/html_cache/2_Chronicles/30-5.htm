Decrees in ancient Israel were authoritative commands, often involving religious reforms or national calls to action. Hezekiah's reign was marked by efforts to restore proper worship and adherence to the Law of Moses, reflecting a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel</b><br>The proclamation was intended to reach all the tribes of Israel, emphasizing unity and collective responsibility in worship. This was significant during a time when the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah were often divided. The call to worship was an invitation to return to the covenant relationship with God, transcending political divisions.<p><b>from Beersheba to Dan</b><br>This phrase denotes the entire land of Israel, from the southernmost point (Beersheba) to the northernmost (Dan). It underscores the comprehensive nature of the call to worship, aiming to include all Israelites. This geographical reference is often used in Scripture to signify the whole nation (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>).<p><b>that the people should come to keep the Passover of the LORD</b><br>The Passover was a foundational feast in Israel's religious calendar, commemorating the Exodus from Egypt and God's deliverance. It was a time of remembrance and renewal of the covenant. The call to observe Passover was a call to return to the roots of their faith and identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This title emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the people's obligation to worship Him alone. The use of this title reinforces the call to national repentance and spiritual renewal.<p><b>in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the designated place for worship and sacrifice, housing the Temple built by Solomon. It was the spiritual center of Israel, where God's presence dwelt. The call to gather in Jerusalem for Passover highlights the importance of centralized worship and the unity of the nation under God's covenant.<p><b>For they had not observed it in great numbers as prescribed</b><br>This indicates a lapse in religious observance, likely due to the idolatry and apostasy that had plagued Israel and Judah. The prescribed observance of Passover was detailed in the Law (Exodus 12, <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>), and neglecting it was a sign of spiritual decline.
