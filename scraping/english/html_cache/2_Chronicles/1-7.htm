It was the night following Solomon's significant act of worship, where he offered a thousand burnt offerings at the high place in Gibeon. This timing underscores the importance of worship and dedication in seeking divine guidance and favor.<p><b>God appeared to Solomon</b><br>The appearance of God to Solomon is a theophany, a direct encounter with the divine. This is significant as it shows God's personal involvement in the lives of His chosen leaders. Solomon, as the newly anointed king, receives divine confirmation and guidance, similar to other biblical figures like Abraham and Moses who also experienced God's direct communication.<p><b>and said,</b><br>God's communication with Solomon is direct and personal, emphasizing the intimate relationship between God and His chosen servant. This direct speech is a hallmark of God's interactions with key biblical figures, indicating the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8220;Ask,</b><br>This invitation to ask is a test of Solomon's heart and priorities. It reflects God's willingness to grant requests that align with His will and purposes. The open-ended nature of this invitation highlights the freedom and responsibility given to Solomon in his role as king.<p><b>and I will give it to you!&#8221;</b><br>God's promise to grant Solomon's request demonstrates His generosity and desire to bless those who seek Him. This offer is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in the New Testament, where He encourages believers to ask, seek, and knock, promising that God will respond to their needs. Solomon's subsequent request for wisdom aligns with God's purposes, setting a precedent for seeking divine wisdom over material wealth or power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem.
