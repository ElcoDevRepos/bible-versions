The act of slaughtering goats for a sin offering was a prescribed ritual in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/4-24.htm">Leviticus 4:24</a>). Goats were often used for sin offerings, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. This act signifies the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering</b><br>The blood of the sacrificed animal was a vital component of the atonement process. According to <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls." The altar was the designated place for offerings, symbolizing God's presence and the need for purification from sin.<p><b>to make atonement for all Israel</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the sacrificial system. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of the offering, emphasizing that the sin offering was made on behalf of the entire nation of Israel. It reflects the collective responsibility and need for national repentance and forgiveness.<p><b>because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel</b><br>King Hezekiah's leadership in ordering these offerings demonstrates his commitment to restoring proper worship and obedience to God. This act of national repentance and renewal is a response to the previous period of idolatry and neglect of the temple under King Ahaz.

To make... atonement; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span>, piel infinitive. This word, which in the one kal occurrence of it (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>) means "to pitch, or cover with pitch," occurs in piel eighty-six times, and is rendered "atone" or "make atonement" sixty-six times, seven times "reconcile" or "make reconciliation," the other renderings being such as "pacify," "purge," "forgive," "cleanse," "be merciful," "put it off," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "expiate" (margin). We are so distinctly twice told that these sacrifices were for all Israel, that it may be taken for granted that the desire of Hezekiah was to include the northern kingdom - with which, under Hoshea, in subjection to the Assyrian king, times were now very hard and ominous of the end - in the benefits of the expiatory offerings now made (so see vers. 5, 6, 10-12 of next chapter). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/29-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the priests</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
