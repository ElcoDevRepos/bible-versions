It was where the presence of God was believed to dwell, and only the high priest could enter, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-34</a>). This sacred space was a continuation of the design from the Tabernacle, emphasizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin, and the need for atonement.<p><b>he made two cherubim</b><br>Cherubim are angelic beings often associated with the presence and glory of God. They are first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, guarding the way to the Tree of Life. In the context of the temple, the cherubim symbolize the guardianship of God's holiness and serve as a reminder of the divine presence. Their inclusion in the Most Holy Place underscores the sacredness of the space and the reverence required in approaching God.<p><b>of sculptured work</b><br>The cherubim were crafted with great skill, indicating the importance of artistry in worship and the temple's construction. This reflects the detailed instructions given by God for the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>) and later for the temple, highlighting the value placed on beauty and craftsmanship in the service of God. The use of sculptured work also points to the permanence and stability of the temple compared to the portable Tabernacle.<p><b>and he overlaid them with gold</b><br>Gold was a symbol of purity, divinity, and kingship, often used in the construction of sacred objects and spaces (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>). The overlaying of the cherubim with gold signifies the preciousness and holiness of the Most Holy Place. Gold's incorruptible nature also points to the eternal and unchanging nature of God.
