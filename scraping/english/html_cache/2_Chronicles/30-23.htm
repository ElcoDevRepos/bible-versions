The assembly refers to the congregation of Israelites who had gathered in Jerusalem for the Passover celebration. This decision to extend the festival indicates a deep spiritual renewal and enthusiasm among the people, as they were experiencing a revival of worship and commitment to God. Historically, this was a significant moment as it marked a return to the proper observance of the Passover, which had been neglected. The extension of the festival also reflects the joy and spiritual hunger of the people, reminiscent of the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8-10</a>), where a similar extension of celebration occurred.<p><b>so they observed seven days with joy</b><br>The observance of the additional seven days with joy underscores the spiritual revival and the presence of God among the people. Joy in the biblical context often signifies the favor and blessing of God, as well as the people's response to His grace and mercy. This joy was not merely an emotional response but a reflection of the people's renewed relationship with God. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the joy found in Christ, who is our Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The joy experienced by the Israelites can be compared to the joy of salvation and the celebration of eternal life through Jesus Christ. The extension of the festival and the joy experienced also foreshadow the eternal celebration and joy in the presence of God, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>.<div
