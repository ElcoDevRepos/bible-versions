Ahaziah, king of Judah, was related to Ahab through his mother Athaliah, Ahab's daughter. Jehu's search for Ahaziah signifies the thoroughness of his mission to eliminate any influence of Ahab's house.<p><b>and Jehu&#8217;s soldiers captured him while he was hiding in Samaria</b><br>Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was a significant city both politically and religiously. Ahaziah's presence there indicates his alliance with the house of Ahab. His attempt to hide suggests fear and recognition of Jehu's divine mandate. This capture fulfills the divine judgment pronounced on the house of Ahab and those associated with it.<p><b>So Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death</b><br>Ahaziah's execution by Jehu's command aligns with the divine judgment against those who led Israel and Judah into idolatry.

This acknowledgment highlights the enduring legacy of a godly ancestor, even amidst judgment.<p><b>So no one was left from the house of Ahaziah with the strength to rule the kingdom</b><br>The eradication of Ahaziah's house signifies the end of his dynasty's influence, fulfilling God's judgment and paving the way for Athaliah's brief and tumultuous reign.

The verse closes with the extinction of Ahaziah&#8217;s immediate line, setting the stage for both crisis and eventual restoration of the Davidic throne.

And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.">2Kings 9:27-28</a> we find a different tradition concerning the death of Ahaziah. That passage, literally rendered, runs as follows: "And Ahaziah king of Judah had seen it (i.e., the death of Jehoram, <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm" title="And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.">2Kings 9:24</a>), and he fled by the way of the garden palace, and Jehu pursued after him, and said, Him, too, smite (shoot) ye him in the chariot!--on the ascent of G-r, beside Ibleam; and he fled to Megiddo, and died there." (Perhaps <span class= "ital">and they smote him</span> has fallen out before the words <span class= "ital">on the ascent of G-r.</span>) "And his servants brought him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own grave, with his fathers, in the city of David." Such divergences are valuable, because they help to establish the independence of the two accounts.<p><span class= "bld">For he was hid.</span>--<span class= "ital">Now he was hiding.</span><p><span class= "bld">And when they had slain him.</span>--<span class= "ital">And they put him to death, and buried him; for they said,</span> &c.<p><span class= "bld">He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord.</span>--A didactic remark in the usual manner of the chronicler.<p><span class= "bld">So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And the house of Ahaziah had none to retain strength for kingship</span> (= capable of assuming the sovereignty).

The verse, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, corrects the italics of <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>; expunging them throws their proper force into the words, "at the going up to Gur," showing that Jehu reckoned on that steep kill to enable his pursuing warriors to overtake Ahaziah; makes a sufficiently possible harmony, to say the least, in respect of the remaining incidents narrated of his life - that he made for the time a successful flight to Megiddo, afterwards sought to hide in deeper retirement in Samaria, was thence brought to Jehu at Megiddo, there eventually slain before his eyes, and by his own servants, who must be supposed to have had some attachment to him, but probably with the sanction of Jehu himself, conveyed "in a chariot to Jerusalem" for sepulture "in the sepulchre of his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="/2_kings/9-28.htm">2 Kings 9:28</a>). The fact that he received decent burial being due to the God-fearing character of his grandfather, and that this should find its record on the page of the book that will last while the world lasts, that very page already two thousand five hundred years old, is a most touching consideration. Megiddo was on the Esdraelon or Jezreel plain, that stretched between the hills of Galilee and those of Mount Ephraim or Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Had no power to keep still the kingdom</span>. The undoubted meaning of this clause is that there was no one of the house of Ahaziah who could succeed him. The Hebrew text does not say, "no one left," etc. But the allusion can scarcely be to anything but the fact that transpires in our ver. 11 (where only Joash is mentioned as a son, and with him a nurse), viz. that his only surviving son was an infant, The king's sons (presumably sons of Ahaziah and grandsons of her own) were among the "seed royal," whom the wicked Athaliah had "destroyed." Gesenius says that the words that wrap in them the slight ambiguity, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, are a phrase peculiar to the later Hebrew, and he instances nine examples, all of which come from Daniel or Chronicles, the virtue of the phrase amounting to the <span class="accented">ports ease</span> of the Latin.
