Ahab is often depicted in the Bible as a king who did evil in the sight of the Lord, largely influenced by his wife Jezebel. His reign is marked by idolatry and conflict with the prophets of Yahweh.<p><b>&#8220;There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD,</b><br>This man is Micaiah, a prophet of Yahweh. In the context of ancient Israel, prophets were seen as messengers of God, providing divine guidance and insight. Micaiah stands in contrast to the false prophets who often told the king what he wanted to hear rather than the truth from God.<p><b>but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad.</b><br>Ahab's hatred for Micaiah highlights the king's preference for favorable prophecies, regardless of their truth. This reflects a broader biblical theme where leaders reject God's true messengers in favor of those who speak pleasing words. It also underscores the tension between Ahab's desires and God's will.<p><b>He is Micaiah son of Imlah.&#8221;</b><br>Micaiah is a lesser-known prophet compared to figures like Elijah or Elisha, yet he plays a crucial role in this narrative. His lineage, being the son of Imlah, is mentioned to distinguish him from other prophets. Micaiah's role is significant as he represents the voice of God amidst a chorus of false prophets.<p><b>&#8220;The king should not say that!&#8221; Jehoshaphat replied.</b><br>Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, is portrayed as a more righteous king who seeks the counsel of the Lord. His response indicates a respect for the prophetic office and a desire for truth, regardless of whether it is favorable. This interaction between Ahab and Jehoshaphat highlights the differing attitudes towards God's word between the two kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel (Ahab)</a></b><br>Ahab was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to bring spiritual reform to Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/micaiah_son_of_imlah.htm">Micaiah son of Imlah</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD who was known for speaking the truth, regardless of the consequences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, where this conversation takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>The false prophets who were present at the court of Ahab, often telling the king what he wanted to hear rather than the truth from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_truth.htm">The Cost of Truth</a></b><br>Micaiah's account reminds us that speaking God's truth can lead to opposition and hatred.

<a href="/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s earlier plea, &#8220;Please inquire of the word of the LORD today&#8221; (2 Chron 18:4), stresses dependence on divine guidance before battle, reflecting <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad</b><p>Ahab&#8217;s hatred exposes his heart.<p>&#8226; He wants affirmation, not truth (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting correction is a mark of folly (<a href="/proverbs/15-12.htm">Proverbs 15:12</a>;

Contrast: Jehoshaphat welcomes the truth even when uncomfortable, foreshadowing the Bereans&#8217; noble reception of Scripture (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is Micaiah son of Imlah</b><p>Micaiah&#8217;s identity is specific; God speaks through real, traceable messengers.<p>&#8226; His name means &#8220;Who is like Yah?&#8221;&#8212;a built-in reminder of God&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Though little is recorded about him, he stands boldly against royal pressure, akin to Elijah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17-18</a>) and Jeremiah before Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-18</a>).<p>&#8226;

Ahab&#8217;s confession of hatred toward Micaiah reveals his rebellion; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s mild protest shows a better&#8212;though imperfect&#8212;disposition. The verse teaches that one faithful voice speaking God&#8217;s Word outweighs any number of flattering voices, and that rejecting uncomfortable prophecy is ultimately rejecting the LORD Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">He never prophesied good unto me, but always evil.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">He is not prophesying to me for good, but all his days for evil.</span> Kings: "He prophesieth not to me good but evil."
