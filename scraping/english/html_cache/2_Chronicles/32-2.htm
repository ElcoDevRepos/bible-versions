His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>, and <a href="/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36-39</a>. He is often remembered for his religious reforms and his trust in God during times of crisis.<br><br>Sennacherib: Sennacherib was the king of Assyria, one of the most powerful empires of the ancient Near East. His reign is well-documented in Assyrian records, and he is known for his military campaigns and the expansion of the Assyrian empire. The conflict with Hezekiah is also recorded in Assyrian annals, providing a historical context for the biblical narrative.<br><br>Had come to make war: This phrase indicates the aggressive intent of Sennacherib against Jerusalem. The Assyrian empire was known for its military prowess and its strategy of siege warfare, which involved surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This was a common tactic in ancient warfare and posed a significant threat to the inhabitants of a besieged city.<br><br>Against Jerusalem: Jerusalem was the capital of Judah and the spiritual center for the Jewish people, housing the temple built by Solomon. The city's significance is both religious and political, making it a prime target for Sennacherib's campaign. The defense of Jerusalem is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's protection over His chosen people and city.<br><br>Biblical Context: This event is part of a larger narrative that includes God's deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrian threat. The story is paralleled in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-19</a> and <a href="/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36-37</a>, where Hezekiah's faith and prayer lead to divine intervention. The angel of the Lord strikes down the Assyrian army, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness.<br><br>Connections to Other Scripture: The siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib is a pivotal moment that highlights themes of trust in God and divine deliverance. It echoes earlier biblical accounts, such as the Exodus, where God delivers His people from seemingly insurmountable odds. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promises to protect and save His people.<br><br>Types of Jesus Christ: Hezekiah's role as a faithful king who seeks God's guidance and protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King and Deliverer. Just as Hezekiah intercedes for his people and trusts in God's salvation, Jesus intercedes for humanity and provides eternal salvation through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in the kingdom.

Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had <span class="accented">been paid</span>, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and "took counsel," etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an <span class="accented">offer</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still "purposed to fight against Jerusalem" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2-4</a>, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/32-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Hezekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
