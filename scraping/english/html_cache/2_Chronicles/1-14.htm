The accumulation of chariots and horses was a sign of power and prestige in the ancient Near East. Chariots were the advanced military technology of the time, often used in warfare and as a symbol of royal authority. The number 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses indicates a significant military force, suggesting Solomon's kingdom was well-defended and influential. This accumulation, however, also hints at a potential disobedience to <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, where kings of Israel were advised not to multiply horses, especially from Egypt, to prevent reliance on military might over God.<p><b>which he stationed in the chariot cities</b><br>Chariot cities were strategic locations where Solomon stationed his chariots and horses. These cities served as military bases and storage facilities, ensuring rapid deployment of forces when needed. Archaeological evidence suggests that these cities were fortified and equipped to support large numbers of horses and chariots. The mention of chariot cities indicates Solomon's strategic planning and administrative skills in maintaining his kingdom's security. It also reflects the influence of Egyptian practices, as Egypt was known for its chariotry and military organization.<p><b>and also with him in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, as the capital city, was the political and spiritual center of Israel. By stationing chariots and horses in Jerusalem, Solomon ensured the protection of the city and his palace. This decision underscores the importance of Jerusalem not only as a religious hub but also as a military stronghold. The presence of such a force in Jerusalem symbolizes the consolidation of power and the centralization of authority under Solomon's reign. It also foreshadows the eventual challenges of maintaining such wealth and power, as seen in the later division of the kingdom after Solomon's death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots_and_horses.htm">Chariots and Horses</a></b><br>Symbols of military strength and power in ancient times.

Yet <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a> had cautioned Israel&#8217;s kings not to multiply horses.

And we obtain just a glimpse of the range of thought and purpose present to the mind of the reigning king. The largo expenditure of money would infer without fail the show of brilliant prosperity in the grand city for the time. Whether this would last, and whether it would not infer oppressive taxation somewhere or other (<a href="/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>) among the people, time would show. Had this expenditure been all to record, none could suppose the commencing of the practical part of the king's reign either sound or auspicious. But, of course, it is to be qualified by other things that were transpiring, with which the parallel acquaints us (e.g. <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>), only in different order. We now, however, begin a rapid and self-contained sketch of the reign of Solomon to his very death (ch. 9.) - the sketch one of marked characteristics, and in consistent keeping with the presumable objects of this work. For it is very much monopolized by the account of the temple. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The contents of this and the following three verses are identical with the parrallel <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, except that the words, "and gold," of our ver. 15 (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>) are not found there. The position of these four verses in the parallel, towards the close of the account of Solomon, would seem more natural than their position here, which has somewhat the appearance of a fragment interpolated, as on the other hand the account of the harlot-mothers there. <span class="cmt_word">Solomon gathered chariots and</span> <span class="cmt_word">horsemen.</span> The chariot was no institution of Israel (so <a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>), neither of their earliest ancestors, nor of those more proximate. The earliest occasions of the mention of it (<a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>) are in connection with Egypt, and almost all subsequent occasions for a long stretch of time show it in connection with some foreign nation, till we read (<a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>) of David "reserving horses" unhoughed "for a hundred chariots," apparently also "reserved" out of the very much larger number which he had taken in battle from Hadadezer King of Zobah. The very genius of the character of God's people, a <span class="accented">pilgrim</span>-genius, as well as their long-time pilgrim<span class="accented">-life</span>, quite accounts for the "chariot," though it be a war-chariot, having never ranked among their treasures (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>). Now, however, Solomon thinks it the time to make it a feature of the nation's power and splendour. He gives the large order for fourteen hundred chariots apparently to Egypt (ver. 17; also ch. 9:28), the appropriate number of horses to which would be probably four thousand (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; comp. <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, where note the corrupt numeral forty thousand, 10:26). Solomon's fourteen hundred chariots were probably intended to exceed the numbers of the Egyptian king (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6</a>), of Hadadezer's (<a href="/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>), and of the Syrians (<a href="/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>). But, on the other hand, see <a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>, unless, as seems very probable, the numerals in these places are again incorrect. Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' contains an interesting article on the chariot (vol. 1:295). For significant allusions to the <span class="accented">horsemen</span>, reference may be made to <a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a><span class="cmt_word">. Twelve thousand horsemen</span>. These probably purport what we should call <span class="accented">horse-soldiers</span>, or cavalry. And. it is likely that they come to designate these in virtue of the Hebrew word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) meaning horses of the cavalry sort (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub</span> <span class="accented">voce</span>). The chariot cities. In <a href="/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5, 6</a> we are expressly told that Solomon "built" purposely these cities, for the chariots and for the horsemen, just as he built the "store" cities (see also <a href="/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17-19</a>; Xenoph., 'Anab.,' 1:4. &sect; 10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">accumulated</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1505;&#1465;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
