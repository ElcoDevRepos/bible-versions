The "ways of the kings of Israel" often refer to idolatry and the worship of Baal, which were prevalent in Israel under the influence of Ahab and Jezebel. This phrase indicates a departure from the worship of Yahweh, which was central to the covenantal identity of Judah. The northern kingdom's practices were condemned by prophets like Elijah and Elisha, who called for a return to the worship of the one true God.<p><b>just as the house of Ahab had done</b><br>The house of Ahab is synonymous with idolatry and moral corruption. Ahab, along with his wife Jezebel, promoted the worship of Baal and Asherah, leading Israel into sin. This comparison highlights Jehoram's alignment with these practices, suggesting a significant spiritual decline in Judah. The influence of Ahab's house was not only religious but also political, as they sought to consolidate power through alliances and marriages, often at the expense of faithfulness to God.<p><b>For he married a daughter of Ahab</b><br>Jehoram's marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, was a political alliance that brought the corrupting influence of Ahab's house into Judah. This union was likely intended to strengthen political ties between the two kingdoms but resulted in the introduction of idolatrous practices into Judah. Athaliah's influence would later lead to further apostasy and violence, as seen in her usurpation of the throne and the subsequent purge of the royal family.<p><b>and did evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical assessment of a king's reign, indicating actions that were contrary to God's commandments. Jehoram's evil deeds included the promotion of idolatry, the persecution of the faithful, and possibly the murder of his own brothers to secure his throne. Such actions were a direct violation of the covenantal laws given to Israel and Judah, which demanded exclusive worship of Yahweh and justice for the people. The phrase underscores the moral and spiritual accountability of leaders before God, who judges according to His righteous standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah who followed the ways of the house of Ahab, leading to his downfall.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_ahab.htm">House of Ahab</a></b><br>A dynasty in the northern kingdom of Israel known for its idolatry and wickedness, particularly under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>A king of Israel notorious for his idolatry and evil practices, married to Jezebel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram's_wife.htm">Jehoram's Wife</a></b><br>The daughter of Ahab, whose influence led Jehoram to adopt the sinful practices of her family.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which Jehoram ruled, and which suffered due to his evil actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_relationships.htm">The Influence of Relationships</a></b><br>Jehoram's marriage to Ahab's daughter led him to adopt sinful practices.
