In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29</a>, King Hezekiah is restoring proper worship in the temple after a period of neglect under his father, King Ahaz. The offerings refer to the sacrifices made to atone for the sins of the people and to consecrate the temple. This act of completing offerings is reminiscent of the detailed sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, which was central to Israelite worship. The completion signifies a return to covenant faithfulness and a renewal of the people's relationship with God.<p><b>the king and all those present with him</b><br>King Hezekiah is a central figure in this narrative, demonstrating leadership in spiritual matters. His involvement underscores the importance of godly leadership in guiding the nation back to righteousness. The phrase "all those present with him" suggests a communal aspect of worship, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the people to participate in religious rites. This communal worship is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the nation of Israel often gathered for festivals and sacrifices, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16.htm">Deuteronomy 16</a>.<p><b>bowed down and worshiped</b><br>Bowing down is a physical act of reverence and submission, indicating humility before God. Worship in this context is not just a ritualistic act but a heartfelt response to God's holiness and mercy. This act of worship aligns with the biblical principle that true worship involves both spirit and truth, as Jesus later teaches in <a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>. The physical act of bowing is also seen in other biblical instances, such as in the worship of the golden calf (Exodus 32) and the dedication of Solomon's temple (1 Kings 8), highlighting both the right and wrong ways to worship. This moment in <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29</a> is a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as it points to the need for atonement and reconciliation with God, which Jesus fulfills in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship.
