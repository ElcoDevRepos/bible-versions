The daily offerings were a central part of Israel's worship, symbolizing continual devotion and atonement for sin. This practice is rooted in the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, where daily burnt offerings were commanded. Solomon's observance underscores his commitment to maintaining the religious practices instituted by God through Moses.<p><b>according to the commandment of Moses</b><br>The reference to the "commandment of Moses" emphasizes the authority of the Mosaic Law, which was foundational for Israel's religious and social life. Moses, as the lawgiver, received these commandments directly from God, as seen in Exodus and Leviticus. This phrase indicates Solomon's dedication to following divine instructions, which were intended to set Israel apart as God's chosen people.<p><b>for Sabbaths, New Moons,</b><br>The mention of "Sabbaths" and "New Moons" refers to specific times of worship and rest. The Sabbath, observed weekly, was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). New Moon festivals, occurring monthly, were times of renewal and dedication (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). These observances were integral to the rhythm of Israel's worship, marking time as sacred and dedicated to God.<p><b>and the three annual appointed feasts&#8212;</b><br>The "three annual appointed feasts" were major pilgrimage festivals that required all Israelite males to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem (<a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>). These feasts were times of communal worship, thanksgiving, and remembrance of God's provision and deliverance.<p><b>the Feast of Unleavened Bread,</b><br>The Feast of Unleavened Bread, closely associated with Passover, commemorated Israel's deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-17.htm">Exodus 12:17-20</a>). It involved eating unleavened bread for seven days, symbolizing purity and the haste of the Exodus. This feast points to Christ as the Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice delivers believers from sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><b>the Feast of Weeks,</b><br>Also known as Pentecost, the Feast of Weeks occurred fifty days after Passover (<a href="/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-21</a>). It celebrated the wheat harvest and the giving of the Law at Sinai. In the New Testament, Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), signifying the birth of the Church and the fulfillment of God's promise to write His law on believers' hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>and the Feast of Tabernacles.</b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles, or Booths, was a time of rejoicing and remembrance of Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>). Participants lived in temporary shelters, recalling God's provision and presence.
