The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship and sacrifice. Abandoning it signifies a rejection of the religious practices and covenantal relationship established by their ancestors, such as David and Solomon. This act of abandonment is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, often leading to spiritual decline and national consequences. The phrase underscores the importance of faithfulness to God's commands and the centrality of worship in maintaining a relationship with Him.<p><b>and served the Asherah poles and idols</b><br>The Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often erected near altars dedicated to Baal. Serving these poles and other idols represents a syncretism with pagan religions, directly violating the first two commandments given to Moses. This idolatry was a significant issue throughout Israel's history, leading to moral and spiritual corruption. The worship of idols was not just a religious failure but also a cultural assimilation into the practices of surrounding nations, which God had explicitly warned against. This phrase highlights the temptation of Israel to adopt the religious customs of their neighbors, leading them away from exclusive devotion to Yahweh.<p><b>So wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs</b><br>The wrath mentioned here is a divine response to the covenant unfaithfulness of Judah and Jerusalem. In the biblical context, God's wrath is not arbitrary but a just response to sin and rebellion. The guilt of the people is their collective responsibility for turning away from God and embracing idolatry. This phrase foreshadows the consequences that would befall Judah, including military defeat, exile, and suffering. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the inevitable judgment that follows unrepentant disobedience. The historical context includes the eventual Babylonian conquest and exile, which were seen as fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the LORD under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A godly priest who influenced Joash positively during his early reign.
