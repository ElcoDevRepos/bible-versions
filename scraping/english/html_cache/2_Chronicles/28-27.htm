Ahaz was a king of Judah known for his idolatry and unfaithfulness to God, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>. His reign was marked by significant spiritual decline, including the introduction of pagan practices and the closing of the temple doors.<p><b>and was buried in the city of Jerusalem</b><br>Ahaz was buried in Jerusalem, the capital of Judah and the spiritual center for the Israelites. Despite his unfaithfulness, he was still given the honor of being buried in the city, which underscores the importance of Jerusalem as a burial site for the kings of Judah. This reflects the cultural and historical significance of Jerusalem as the city of David, where many of the kings of Judah were laid to rest.<p><b>but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel</b><br>This indicates a significant dishonor, as the tombs of the kings were reserved for those who were respected and honored. Ahaz's exclusion from these tombs highlights the disapproval of his reign and actions. It serves as a cultural and historical marker of disgrace, showing that his idolatry and failure to follow God&#8217;s commandments were not forgotten by his successors or the people of Judah.<p><b>And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place</b><br>Hezekiah's ascension to the throne marks a significant turning point for Judah. Unlike his father, Hezekiah is remembered as a righteous king who sought to restore the worship of Yahweh and purify the temple, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-31</a>. His reign is characterized by religious reforms and a return to the covenant with God, making him a type of Christ in his role as a restorer and reformer. Hezekiah's reign is also significant in biblical prophecy, as he is mentioned in the context of the Assyrian threat and the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation into idolatry and away from God.

Scripture states it matter-of-factly, yet the phrase &#8220;rested with his fathers&#8221; carries weight.<p>&#8226; It affirms the historical reality that Ahaz truly lived and truly died, just like the kings who preceded him (<a href="/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-38.htm">2 Kings 15:38</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds readers that earthly power is temporary; kings and commoners alike must face their Maker (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; It frames the rest of the verse as God&#8217;s evaluation of Ahaz&#8217;s legacy. His reign is over, but the consequences of his choices linger (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was buried in the city of Jerusalem</b><p>The king is laid to rest inside Jerusalem, the city chosen by God for His Name (2 Chron 6:6). Even a wicked ruler is given the dignity of burial among his own people&#8212;yet the chronicler hints that honor is about to be curtailed.<p>&#8226; Burial within the capital was customary for Davidic kings (<a href="/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The location underscores that Ahaz, though faithless, still belonged to the Davidic line God promised to preserve (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel</b><p>Here the chronicler draws a stark line: Ahaz receives a burial, but not the place of royal honor.<p>&#8226; Similar dishonor fell on Jehoram (2 Chron 21:20) and Joash (24:25), both remembered for unfaithfulness.<p>&#8226; Withholding the royal sepulcher signaled public disapproval and divine judgment (<a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;kings of Israel&#8221; refers to the united Davidic line, not the northern kingdom. By excluding Ahaz from their tombs, the nation acknowledges that his life contradicted the covenant standards set for David&#8217;s heirs (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place</b><p>Death removes Ahaz, but God&#8217;s purposes continue. A new chapter opens with Hezekiah, whose reign will be marked by reform and blessing (<a href="/2_kings/18-1.htm">2 Kings 18:1&#8211;8</a>; 2 Chron 29:1&#8211;3).<p>&#8226; The seamless succession shows God&#8217;s steadfast commitment to the Davidic promise despite human failure (<a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between father and son underscores personal responsibility; Hezekiah chooses faithfulness regardless of his upbringing (<a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The transition prepares readers for the revival that follows a season of national decline, illustrating God&#8217;s readiness to restore when His people return to Him (2 Chron 7:14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/28-27.htm">2 Chronicles 28:27</a> records more than a funeral notice. It declares that earthly power cannot shield a king from accountability. Ahaz dies, is buried in Jerusalem, yet denied the honor of the royal tombs&#8212;a public testimony that idolatry brings shame. His story closes, but God&#8217;s covenant marches on as Hezekiah ascends the throne, proving that the Lord can raise up new leadership to accomplish His faithful purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slept with his fathers... buried... in the city,...
