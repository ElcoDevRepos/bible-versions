The term "cast metal" indicates that it was made using a casting process, likely involving bronze, which was a common material for temple furnishings. This basin symbolizes purification and cleansing, essential for the priests before performing their duties. The use of metal signifies durability and the importance of the object in temple rituals. The Sea's construction reflects the craftsmanship and resources available during Solomon's reign, emphasizing the grandeur of the temple.<p><b>It was circular in shape,</b><br>The circular shape of the Sea is significant, as circles often symbolize eternity and perfection in biblical literature. This design choice may reflect the divine nature of God, who is eternal and perfect. The circular form also allows for a large volume of water, necessary for the numerous purification rituals conducted by the priests. The shape may also have practical implications, facilitating easier access for the priests around its perimeter.<p><b>measuring ten cubits from rim to rim,</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, the Sea's diameter was approximately 15 feet or 4.5 meters. This substantial size underscores the importance of purification in temple worship and the scale of operations in Solomon's temple. The dimensions also highlight the resources and labor invested in the temple's construction, reflecting the wealth and dedication of Solomon's kingdom.<p><b>five cubits in height,</b><br>The height of five cubits, about 7.5 feet or 2.25 meters, indicates the Sea's significant capacity and the volume of water it could hold. This height would require steps or a platform for the priests to access the water, suggesting a structured approach to ritual purification. The height also emphasizes the grandeur and imposing presence of the Sea within the temple courtyard.<p><b>and thirty cubits in circumference.</b><br>The circumference of thirty cubits, approximately 45 feet or 13.5 meters, confirms the Sea's large size and capacity. This measurement aligns with the mathematical relationship between diameter and circumference, demonstrating the precision and skill of the craftsmen. The Sea's size allowed it to serve the needs of many priests, facilitating the temple's extensive sacrificial system. The number thirty may also have symbolic significance, as numbers often carry deeper meanings in biblical texts, potentially representing completeness or divine order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple, including the Sea of cast metal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, built by Solomon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_cast_metal.htm">The Sea of Cast Metal</a></b><br>A large basin used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing purification and readiness for service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purification.htm">Symbolism of Purification</a></b><br>The Sea of cast metal represents the need for spiritual cleansing.

The Hebrew of this verse and of <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> are facsimiles of one author, except that here <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> stands, where the parallel shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, probably the fruit merely of some error in transcription. Verses like these point not to the derivation of Chronicles from Kings, but rather of both from some older common source. This sea of brass superseded the laver of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 28</a>; <a href="/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>). It was called a sea on account of its size. We are told in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a> whence David had drawn the supplies of metal necessary for this work. The size of the diameter measured from upper rim to rim (ten cubits) harmonizes, of course, to all practical purposes, with that of the circumference (thirty cubits); it would assist questions connected with the contents of this large vessel, however, if we had been told whether the circumference were measured at the rim, or, as the form of language here used might slightly favour, round the girth. (For these questions, see ver. 5 below.) This sea for the washing of the priests significantly follows the altar. Beside the general suggestion of the need of purification or sanctification, it here reminds of the fact that the earthly priest and high priest must need the purification, which their great Antitype would not need. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
