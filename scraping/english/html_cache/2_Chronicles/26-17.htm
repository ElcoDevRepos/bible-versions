The name Azariah means "Yahweh has helped," which is significant in the context of his role as a spiritual leader. The high priest held a position of great authority and responsibility, serving as a mediator between God and the people. This role is a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>along with eighty brave priests of the LORD</b><br>The mention of eighty priests highlights the gravity of the situation. These priests were not only numerous but also described as "brave," indicating the courage required to confront a king. The priests were Levites, set apart for service to God, and their bravery underscores their commitment to uphold God's law. This reflects the biblical principle that true courage is rooted in faithfulness to God (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p><b>went in after him</b><br>The priests went in after King Uzziah, who had unlawfully entered the temple to burn incense, a duty reserved for priests. This act of confrontation was necessary to uphold the sanctity of the temple and the proper worship of God. The priests' actions demonstrate the importance of obedience to God's commands and the consequences of pride and presumption. This incident foreshadows the New Testament teaching that all believers are called to be a royal priesthood, serving God with reverence and humility (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah_the_priest.htm">Azariah the Priest</a></b><br>Azariah is the high priest who courageously confronts King Uzziah when he unlawfully enters the temple to burn incense, an act reserved for the priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighty_brave_priests.htm">Eighty Brave Priests</a></b><br>These are the priests who support Azariah in confronting King Uzziah.

Scripture consistently shows that when an authority figure rebels, God quickly raises a witness (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226;
