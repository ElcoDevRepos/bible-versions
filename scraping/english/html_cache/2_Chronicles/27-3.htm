The Upper Gate of the house of the LORD refers to a specific entrance to the Temple in Jerusalem. This gate was significant for its role in the religious life of Judah, serving as a point of access for worshippers. The act of rebuilding suggests a period of restoration and renewal, possibly after neglect or damage. This reflects Jotham's commitment to maintaining the sanctity and functionality of the Temple, aligning with the biblical emphasis on proper worship and reverence for God. The Temple itself is a type of Christ, representing God's presence among His people, and Jotham's work can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's role in restoring the relationship between God and humanity.<p><b>and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel</b><br>The hill of Ophel is a significant geographical location in Jerusalem, situated between the City of David and the Temple Mount. It was a fortified area, and Jotham's extensive work on the wall indicates a focus on strengthening the city's defenses. This construction effort highlights the importance of security and protection for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, reflecting the biblical theme of God as a fortress and protector. The wall's fortification can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual fortitude, emphasizing the need for vigilance in maintaining one's faith. Historically, the fortification of Ophel would have been crucial in safeguarding the city from external threats, underscoring the king's role as both a spiritual and political leader.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Uzziah, known for his righteous reign and efforts to strengthen the kingdom both spiritually and physically.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/upper_gate_of_the_house_of_the_lord.htm">Upper Gate of the House of the LORD</a></b><br>A significant entrance to the temple in Jerusalem, symbolizing access to worship and the presence of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wall_of_ophel.htm">Wall of Ophel</a></b><br>A fortified area in Jerusalem, indicating Jotham's commitment to the security and defense of the city.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_worship.htm">Commitment to Worship</a></b><br>Jotham's rebuilding of the Upper Gate highlights the importance of maintaining and prioritizing worship in our lives.

Jotham&#8217;s actions mark a deliberate turn toward obedience and stewardship.<p>&#8226; The word rebuilt tells us he restored what had been neglected, echoing principles of faithful leadership found in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4-5</a>, where Joash repaired the temple, and in <a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>, where returning exiles resumed construction.<p>&#8226; Jotham&#8217;s restoration ministry shows how godly rulers prioritize spiritual infrastructure before military or economic projects (cf. <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Upper Gate</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;the Upper Gate&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a> repeats that Jotham &#8220;rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD,&#8221; confirming this specific focus.<p>&#8226; Gates controlled access; rebuilding the uppermost gate symbolizes safeguarding worship and regulating who enters (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>; 100:4).<p>&#8226; By tackling the Upper Gate first, Jotham placed premium value on approaching God properly, aligning with <a href="/psalms/118-19.htm">Psalm 118:19-20</a>, &#8220;Open to me the gates of righteousness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;of the house of the LORD&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The temple remained God&#8217;s chosen earthly dwelling (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>).

A ditch was cut across the narrowest part of the ridge, which separated the temple hill itself from the Bezetha hill. In these parts fortifications were built, and no doubt to such it is our text calls attention. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jotham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rebuilt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Upper</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;el&#183;y&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
