Historically, after the division of the united monarchy, Israel and Judah often had strained relations. However, Hezekiah's reforms and religious revival efforts brought a sense of unity among the people. The mention of "cities of Judah" indicates the geographical focus of Hezekiah's reforms, emphasizing the centrality of Jerusalem and the surrounding areas in religious activities.<p><b>also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks</b><br>The practice of tithing, or giving a tenth, was an established part of the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-32</a>). It was a means of supporting the Levitical priesthood and the temple services. The inclusion of herds and flocks in the tithe reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where livestock was a primary measure of wealth and sustenance. This act of obedience to the law signifies the people's commitment to the covenant and their recognition of God's provision.<p><b>and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to the LORD their God</b><br>The "holy things" likely refer to items set apart for sacred use, possibly including produce, grain, or other offerings dedicated to God. This dedication underscores the people's reverence and acknowledgment of God's holiness. The act of consecration is a reminder of the Israelites' call to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>and they laid them in large heaps</b><br>The large heaps symbolize the abundance of the offerings and the people's generosity. This imagery reflects the success of Hezekiah's reforms and the people's willingness to return to faithful worship. The heaps also serve as a visible testament to God's blessing and the community's collective effort to honor Him. This act of gathering and storing the tithes in heaps can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament principle of giving generously and cheerfully (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites_and_judahites.htm">Israelites and Judahites</a></b><br>The people of the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah) who were living in the cities of Judah.
