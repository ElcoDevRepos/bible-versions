Asa's reign is noted for his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry and to restore the worship of Yahweh. The historical context is crucial, as it was a time when the kingdom was divided into Israel and Judah, with frequent conflicts and instability.<p><b>there was no safety for travelers</b><br>Travel during this period was perilous due to the lack of centralized control and the presence of hostile forces. The roads were often unsafe, reflecting the broader social and political instability. This lack of safety can be compared to the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), leading to lawlessness and danger.<p><b>because the residents of the lands</b><br>The "residents of the lands" refers to the people living in the territories surrounding Judah, including the Northern Kingdom of Israel and neighboring nations. These groups often had conflicting interests and engaged in skirmishes, contributing to the overall insecurity. The geopolitical landscape was complex, with various tribes and nations vying for power and territory.<p><b>had many conflicts</b><br>The conflicts mentioned were likely both internal and external. Internally, there were struggles for power and influence within the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Externally, there were threats from surrounding nations such as the Philistines, Moabites, and Edomites. These conflicts can be seen as a consequence of the people's departure from God's commandments, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to turmoil and strife.
