Taking an oath to the LORD signifies a solemn commitment to follow God's commandments and to reject idolatry. Oaths in the ancient Near East were serious and binding, often invoking divine witnesses. This act reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, reminiscent of the covenant renewals seen in <a href="/joshua/24-25.htm">Joshua 24:25</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/10-29.htm">Nehemiah 10:29</a>.<p><b>with a loud voice</b><br>The use of a loud voice indicates the communal and public nature of the oath. It was not a private or individual act but a collective declaration of faith and allegiance to God. This public proclamation underscores the seriousness and sincerity of their commitment, similar to the public reading of the Law in <a href="/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>.<p><b>with shouting</b><br>Shouting in biblical times often accompanied significant religious or military events, symbolizing enthusiasm, unity, and determination. In this context, it reflects the people's fervent dedication to the LORD. Shouting is also seen in other biblical events, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>, where it signified divine intervention and victory.<p><b>trumpets</b><br>Trumpets, or shofars, were used in Israel for various purposes, including religious ceremonies, signaling in battle, and marking important events. The use of trumpets here emphasizes the solemnity and importance of the occasion. Trumpets are also associated with divine presence and revelation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Sinai.<p><b>and rams&#8217; horns</b><br>Rams' horns, or shofars, are specifically linked to religious and ceremonial uses in Israelite culture. They were blown to announce the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>) and during the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>).
