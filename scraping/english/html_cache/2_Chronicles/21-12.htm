Elijah, a prominent prophet in Israel, typically delivered messages in person. The letter's existence suggests a divine intervention, as Elijah had been taken up to heaven before Jehoram's reign. This indicates the letter's supernatural origin, emphasizing the seriousness of its message. Elijah's role as a prophet was to call people back to faithfulness to God, and this letter serves as a posthumous warning to Jehoram.<p><b>which stated: &#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says:</b><br>The invocation of "the LORD, the God of your father David" underscores the covenantal relationship between God and the Davidic line. It reminds Jehoram of his heritage and the responsibilities that come with it. The reference to David highlights the ideal king who was after God's own heart, contrasting sharply with Jehoram's actions. This phrase serves as a reminder of the divine promises and expectations placed upon the kings of Judah.<p><b>&#8216;You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah,</b><br>Jehoram is being compared to his predecessors, Jehoshaphat and Asa, who were generally regarded as righteous kings. Jehoshaphat was known for his reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh, while Asa was noted for his religious reforms and reliance on God. By stating that Jehoram has not followed in their ways, the letter highlights his failure to uphold the spiritual and moral standards set by his forefathers. This phrase serves as a condemnation of Jehoram's apostasy and his turning away from the covenantal path established by his ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_prophet.htm">Elijah the Prophet</a></b><br>A significant prophet in Israel known for his powerful ministry and miracles.

Elijah, though a very old man, may have been still alive. His extreme age would account for his sending a written prophecy, rather than going in person to warn Jehoram. If, however, it be supposed that the author of Kings has told the story of Elijah's translation in its right place chronologically, and that the campaign described in the following chapter, in which Jehoshaphat took part, was really subsequent to that event, we may say that this "writing from Elijah the prophet," containing the substance of some last utterances of his directed against Jehoram and Athaliah, was now put into written shape, and forwarded to Jehoram by one of the prophet's pupils, perhaps by his great successor Elisha. (See <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.">2Kings 2:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>.) This explanation may seem to be favoured by the indefiniteness of the phrase, "a writing from Elijah" (<span class= "ital">not</span> a letter); but <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a> is hardly conclusive against the assumption that Elijah was still alive. Elisha's ministry may have begun, probably did begin, some time before his master's ascension, and the description of him in <a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm" title="But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.">2Kings 3:11</a>, "Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah," need not mean more than "Elisha the son of Shaphat, the servant of Elijah."

The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, noun, from verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>. This noun does not occur very frequently, but is found in the following passages, viz.: <a href="/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>. A note in Grove's interesting article, "Elijah" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' vol. 1. p. 580), says that the word is almost identical with the Arabic word of the present day, while the ordinary Hebrew word for a "letter" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> oftener rendered "book." <span class="cmt_word">There came</span>. That this is the precise language used rather helps the persuasion that it was the well-known Prophet Elijah of Israel, who, not resident in Judah, and perhaps very near the end of his life, and in sight of his translation, was taught and directed divinely to send this message of rebuke and terror for Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">Elijah</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> Some hold that it certainly was not the well-known prophet of the northern kingdom who is here intended. "Time, place, and circumstance," says Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, of Belfast ('Handbook to the Books of Chronicles,' p. 127), difference him "from the Tishbite." And he confidently considers him (with Cajetan) another Elijah (<a href="/ezra/10-21.htm">Ezra 10:21</a>), or Eliah (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>; for the form rendered so), or Eliyahu, in which form the Hebrew name appears (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, being the forms of the name found), on the grounds that the Tishbite was translated in the time of Jehoram's father Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>); that his sphere was in the northern kingdom, and himself more of one who wrought mighty works and spoke <span class="accented">otherwise</span> than as a prophet; and that the designation "the prophet" need by no means denote him exclusively. He adds that a "writing" from a prophet is nothing strange, which may be easily conceded but poorly instanced by <a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>; better by <a href="/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1, 2, 6</a>. On the other hand, Grove (in article above quoted) and others find no invincible difficulty in accepting this Elijah for the famous prophet. His mention here is, of course, exceedingly interesting. as the only mention of him in Chro-nicles - a fact which very remarkably falls in with the abstinence as well as the fulness of the compiler of Chronicles. Josephus pronounces that the letter was sent during Elijah's life ('Ant.,' 9:05. &sect; 2), surmises to the contrary having been made. While Elijah's translation seems to have taken place before Jehoshaphat's death, from what we read of <span class="accented">Elisha</span> (<a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>), we may well account that Elisha had begun his <span class="accented">ministry before</span> his master's translation. Not only the ether passages that confirm, but in especial the passage (<a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>) which tells of Jehoram's being, before his father's death, on the throne of Judah at the time of Elijah's interview with Ahaziah (a passage that occurs immediately preceding the account of Elijah's last acts), might have led us to suppose that Elijah's letter was before Jehoshaphat's death, during the joint reign, but for the mention of the slaying of his sons. Bertheau, in our text in his 'Chronik,' points out the resemblance which the "writing" shows to the matter of the speeches of Elijah, while in certain respects of style, and the very insulated sort of introduction it has here, it greatly differs from the narrative in which it is now set. Although the calculation may seem rather a fine one, the circumstances described accurately point to the "writing" of Elijah reaching Jehoram before the chronologically misplaced translation of Elijah as given in <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-11</a>. This question may be instanced as one of the interesting moot points by no means compassed with insuperable difficulty, but challenging careful study and patient comparison of chronological and historical passages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a letter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7733;&#183;t&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4385.htm">Strong's 4385: </a> </span><span class="str2">A thing written, the characters, a document</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
