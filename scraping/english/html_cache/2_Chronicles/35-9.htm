The Levites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and later the temple, and they played a crucial role in the religious life of the nation. The mention of these individuals highlights the importance of family and lineage in the Levitical duties, as roles were often passed down through generations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God working through families and lineages, as seen in the genealogies of Jesus in the Gospels.<p><b>as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, officers of the Levites</b><br>Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad are identified as officers, indicating they held positions of authority and responsibility within the Levitical order. The term "officers" suggests a structured hierarchy within the Levites, necessary for organizing large-scale religious events like the Passover. This structure is reminiscent of the order and organization seen in the early church, as described in the New Testament, where roles and responsibilities were clearly defined to ensure the effective functioning of the church body.<p><b>contributed to the Levites 5,000 Passover offerings</b><br>The contribution of 5,000 Passover offerings by these leaders underscores the communal and sacrificial nature of the Passover celebration. The Passover was a pivotal event in Israel's history, commemorating their deliverance from Egypt, and it required significant resources and preparation. This act of contribution reflects the principle of generosity and provision for communal worship, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are encouraged to support one another and the work of the church.<p><b>and 500 bulls</b><br>The offering of 500 bulls signifies a substantial sacrifice, indicating the scale and importance of the Passover celebration during this period. Bulls were considered valuable and were often used in significant sacrifices, symbolizing strength and atonement. This offering can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The magnitude of the offering points to the seriousness with which the people approached their worship and the lengths to which they went to honor God, paralleling the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus on the cross for the sins of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/conaniah.htm">Conaniah</a></b><br>A leader among the Levites who played a significant role in organizing the Passover offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah_and_nethanel.htm">Shemaiah and Nethanel</a></b><br>Brothers of Conaniah, also involved in the preparation and provision of offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hashabiah,_jeiel,_and_jozabad.htm">Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad</a></b><br>Officers of the Levites who contributed to the Passover offerings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Israel assigned to religious duties, particularly in the temple, and responsible for assisting in the Passover celebration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_offerings.htm">Passover Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made during the Passover, a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_leadership_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>The involvement of Conaniah and his brothers underscores the critical role of leadership in organizing and facilitating worship.

God often stirs multiple hearts to supply needs (<a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-16.htm">Philippians 4:16&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel</b><p>These first three Levites are highlighted together, suggesting a family unit eager to serve.

The sheer number underscores national revival: &#8220;No Passover like it had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel&#8221; (2 Chron 35:18).
