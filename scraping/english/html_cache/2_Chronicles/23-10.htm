In the context of <a href="/2_chronicles/23.htm">2 Chronicles 23</a>, Jehoiada the priest is orchestrating a coup to overthrow Queen Athaliah and restore the rightful king, Joash, to the throne. The troops mentioned are likely the Levites and the royal guards who were loyal to the Davidic line. This action reflects the importance of military support in securing political power in ancient Israel.<p><b>with their weapons in hand</b><br>The presence of weapons underscores the seriousness and potential danger of the situation. The use of weapons by the Levites, who were typically temple servants, highlights the extraordinary circumstances. This also reflects the biblical theme of God using unexpected means and people to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other scriptures where God empowers unlikely individuals for His plans.<p><b>surrounding the king by the altar and the temple</b><br>The altar and the temple are central to Israelite worship and symbolize God's presence among His people. By surrounding the king in this sacred space, Jehoiada emphasizes the divine legitimacy of Joash's kingship. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both King and High Priest, and whose reign is established in the presence of God.<p><b>from the south side to the north side of the temple</b><br>This phrase indicates a comprehensive protection strategy, ensuring that all possible approaches to the king are guarded. The temple's layout, with its specific north and south sides, reflects the detailed instructions given by God for its construction, as seen in earlier scriptures. This thorough protection signifies the importance of safeguarding God's chosen leader, paralleling the divine protection over Jesus Christ during His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key figure in the restoration of the Davidic line, Jehoiada orchestrated the protection and coronation of Joash, the rightful king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young king of Judah, hidden in the temple for six years to protect him from Athaliah, who had usurped the throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The queen mother who seized the throne of Judah after the death of her son, King Ahaziah, and sought to destroy the royal family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem, where Jehoiada stationed the guards to protect Joash during his coronation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>Located in the temple, it was a significant place of sacrifice and worship, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God orchestrates events to fulfill His promises, as seen in the preservation of the Davidic line through Joash.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Role of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoiada's faithfulness and courage demonstrate the impact of godly leadership in guiding and protecting God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_readiness.htm">Spiritual Readiness</a></b><br>Just as the guards were armed and ready, Christians are called to be spiritually prepared, equipped with the armor of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_the_temple.htm">The Importance of the Temple</a></b><br>The temple as a place of worship and God's presence highlights the importance of maintaining a relationship with God through worship and prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_unity.htm">Community and Unity</a></b><br>The collective effort of the people in protecting the king underscores the power of unity and community in achieving God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_23_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 23:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chr_23_10_God_s_protection_via_strategy.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 23:10 demonstrate God's protection through strategic planning?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Priests_and_Levites_role_in_2_Chr_23_10.htm">What role did the priests and Levites play in 2 Chronicles 23:10?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_2_Chronicles_23_10_today.htm">How can we apply the principles of vigilance from 2 Chronicles 23:10 today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Biblical_events_God_uses_people_as_guards.htm">What other biblical events show God using people to guard His purposes?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_23_10_Trust_God_s_provision.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 23:10 encourage us to trust in God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_2_Chronicles_23_10.htm">What is the historical context of 2 Chronicles 23:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_23_10_and_God_s_protection.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 23:10 reflect God's protection over His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Priests_role_in_2_Chronicles_23_10.htm">What role did the priests play in 2 Chronicles 23:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_chronicles_23.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Chronicles 23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_2_chronicles_23_16-21_reforms_credible.htm">Are the religious reforms in 2 Chronicles 23:16-21 historically credible, or do they reflect an idealized narrative from a later period?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/where's_jehu's_purge_evidence.htm">Where is the archaeological evidence for Jehu's widespread purge and the destruction of the Baal temple in 2 Kings 10:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_many_overseers_did_solomon_appoint.htm">How many overseers did Solomon appoint for the work of building the temple?
