This encounter occurs during the reign of King Asa, who ruled Judah from approximately 911 to 870 BC. Asa was initially a king who sought to follow the ways of the LORD, instituting reforms and removing idolatry from the land. The role of a seer was crucial in guiding the kings and people of Israel and Judah, often delivering messages directly from God. This visit from Hanani marks a pivotal moment in Asa's reign, highlighting the importance of prophetic voices in the governance of God's people.<p><b>and told him, &#8220;Because you have relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God,</b><br>This phrase underscores a critical error in Asa's leadership. Instead of trusting in God, Asa sought an alliance with Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram (Syria), to fend off the threat from Baasha, king of Israel. This reliance on a foreign power rather than on God reflects a lack of faith and a departure from Asa's earlier devotion. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where reliance on God was paramount. The historical context shows that alliances with foreign nations often led to spiritual and political complications for Israel and Judah.<p><b>the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.</b><br>This statement reveals the consequence of Asa's misplaced trust. By relying on Aram, Asa missed the opportunity to defeat them, which could have strengthened Judah's position. Theologically, this illustrates the principle that disobedience and lack of faith can lead to missed blessings and opportunities. The escape of Aram's army signifies a lost victory that could have been secured had Asa relied on divine intervention. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of political alliances that compromise faithfulness to God, a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanani_the_seer.htm">Hanani the Seer</a></b><br>A prophet who delivers God's message to King Asa, rebuking him for his lack of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa,_king_of_judah.htm">Asa, King of Judah</a></b><br>The king who initially followed God but later relied on human alliances instead of divine help.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_aram.htm">The King of Aram</a></b><br>A foreign ruler whom Asa relied upon instead of trusting in God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, ruled by Asa during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Asa's reliance on a foreign king rather than God, leading to a missed opportunity for victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_vs._human_alliances.htm">Reliance on God vs. Human Alliances</a></b><br>Asa's account teaches the importance of trusting God over human solutions.

What could have been a testimony now becomes a scar.<p>&#8226; Yet even judgment carries mercy: God exposes the loss so Asa can still humble himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7</a> shows that the moment we shift reliance from the Lord to human schemes, we trade certain victory for needless loss. God loves His people enough to send clear, courageous voices that call us back to wholehearted trust.

The use of this term seems to point to an ancient source of this narrative which is peculiar to the chronicler. Nothing beyond what is here told is known of Hanani. He was perhaps the father of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani, who prophesied against Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm" title="Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,">1Kings 16:1</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>) and rebuked Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath on you from before the LORD.">2Chronicles 19:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria.</span>--Hanani's words are in perfect accord with the teachings of the greater prophets, a fact which favours their authenticity.

The fact furnishes clear indication that our compiler was not indebted to the writer of Kings for material. And the moral aspects of the matter here preserved by the compiler of Chronicles show the paramount reasons why he would not miss bringing it to the front for the returned people's better religious education. Presumably <span class="cmt_word">Hanani the seer</span> is the father of that other faithful seer and prophet Jehu, who appeared to Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1, 7</a>) and to Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore is the host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand</span> It is plain that, reading the lines only, this expression (remarkable considering its following close upon successful help given by Benhadad, and help unaccompanied, so far as we are told, by any infidelity or untoward circumstance), suggests option of explanation, and would engender the supposition that something very threatening was on the horizon, at any rate. But reading <span class="accented">between the</span> lines, and giving due weight to the significance of the illustration adduced of the combined Ethiopians and Lubim (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), we may warrantably judge that Hanani's inspired language went a cut deeper, and meant that if the alliance had been not broken between Benhadad and Baasha, both would surely have been taken in one net (<a href="/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>), as they would have entered into the conflict in alliance. A decisive victory over the King of Syria would have been any way a grand day in the history of Judah; But such a victory over the Kings of Syria and of the northern schismatic kingdom would have been more than a doubly grand day; it would have been a tenfold demonstration of God's judgment, that "though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished" (see particularly same Hebrew verb used of a bird escaped in <a href="/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
