Shields and spears were common weapons in ancient warfare, indicating a focus on defense and readiness for conflict. The act of placing these weapons in all the cities suggests a comprehensive approach to fortification, ensuring that each city was equipped to defend itself. This reflects the political and military tension of the time, as Rehoboam sought to secure his kingdom against potential threats, particularly from the northern tribes under Jeroboam's rule. The emphasis on military readiness can be seen as a response to the division of the kingdom, a significant event in Israel's history.<p><b>and strengthened them greatly</b><br>Rehoboam's efforts to strengthen the cities indicate a focus on consolidating power and ensuring the security of his reign. This strengthening likely involved not only military fortifications but also administrative and economic measures to support the cities' defenses. The phrase suggests a period of relative stability and security for Judah and Benjamin, despite the broader context of division and conflict. This action can be seen as a fulfillment of the divine promise to maintain a remnant of David's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>, where God promises to give one tribe to Solomon's son for the sake of David.<p><b>So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him</b><br>This statement underscores the political reality following the division of the united monarchy. Judah and Benjamin were the two tribes that remained loyal to Rehoboam, forming the southern kingdom of Judah. This division was a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Solomon regarding the tearing of the kingdom due to his idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). The mention of these two tribes highlights the reduced scope of Rehoboam's rule compared to his father Solomon's expansive kingdom. The loyalty of Judah and Benjamin also reflects the historical and cultural ties to Jerusalem, the political and religious center of the southern kingdom, where the temple built by Solomon stood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, Rehoboam is central to this passage as he fortifies the cities of Judah and Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_benjamin.htm">Judah and Benjamin</a></b><br>These are the two tribes that remained loyal to Rehoboam after the division of the kingdom.
