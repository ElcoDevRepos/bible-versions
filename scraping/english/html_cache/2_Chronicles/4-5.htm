A handbreadth is approximately four inches, suggesting durability and strength. This detail highlights the craftsmanship and resources dedicated to the temple, reflecting the importance of worship in Israelite society. The use of such a measurement also connects to other biblical descriptions of sacred objects, emphasizing precision and care in following divine instructions.<p><b>and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom</b><br>The imagery of a cup and a lily blossom suggests beauty and elegance. The lily is often associated with purity and is a common motif in biblical literature, symbolizing God's provision and care (e.g., <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>). The design reflects the aesthetic values of the time and the desire to create a space that honors God with both function and form. This artistic detail may also symbolize the abundance and life-giving nature of God's presence, as water is a source of life.<p><b>It could hold three thousand baths</b><br>The capacity of the basin, holding three thousand baths, underscores its immense size and the scale of temple operations. A bath is an ancient unit of measurement, roughly equivalent to six gallons, indicating the basin could hold about 18,000 gallons of water. This large capacity was necessary for the numerous ritual washings required by the priests, as described in Levitical law. The provision for such a large amount of water signifies the importance of purification and cleanliness in worship, foreshadowing the ultimate purification through Christ's sacrifice, as water often symbolizes cleansing and renewal in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple, including the crafting of the Sea of cast metal described in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, built by Solomon as a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_cast_metal.htm">The Sea of Cast Metal</a></b><br>A large basin used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing purification and readiness to serve in the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman who assisted Solomon by providing materials and expertise for the temple's construction, including the Sea.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was built, serving as the spiritual center for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity.htm">Symbolism of Purity</a></b><br>The Sea of cast metal represents the need for spiritual cleansing.

Perhaps the true reading is, "holding three thousand baths," the last verb being a gloss borrowed from Kings. So Vulg. Syriac and Arabic omit the clause. The LXX. had the present reading. <a href="/1_kings/7-26.htm" title="And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.">1Kings 7:26</a> reads, <span class= "ital">two thousand baths would it contain.</span> Most critics assume this to be correct. Some scribe may have read '<span class= "ital">al?phim,</span> "thousands," instead of <span class= "ital">'alpayim, "</span>two thousand," and then have added "three" (<span class= "ital">sh?l?sheth</span>) under the influence of the last verse. But it is more likely that the numeral "three" having been inadvertently omitted from the text of Kings, the indefinite word "thousands" was made definite by turning it into the dual "two thousand" Either mistake would be possible, because in the unpointed text <span class= "ital">'al?phim</span> and <span class= "ital">'alpayim</span> are written alike. The Syriac has the curious addition, "And he made ten poles, and put five on the right and five on the left, and bare with them the altar of burnt offerings." Similarly the Arabic version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An handbreadth</span>.

It received and held should be translated, <span class="accented">it was able</span> to <span class="accented">hold</span>. Three thousand baths. The parallel has two thousand baths, and this latter is the likelier reading. It is, however, conceivable that the statement of Kings may purport to give the quantity of water used, and that of Chronicles the quantity which the vessel at its fullest could accommodate. As to the real capacity of the bath, we are hopelessly at sea. Josephus's estimate of it is about eight gallons and a half, that of the rabbinists about four gallons and a half (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 3:1742), and Conder, in the 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 80, a fractional quantity above six gallons. The largest bowls on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, the silver bowl of Croesus, and the bronze bowl in Scythia (Herodotus, 1:51; 4:81), did not, under the lowest estimate of the bath, hold as much as one-half of the contents of this vast sea of brass of Solomon. The use of this vessel was, as we read in the next verse, for the priests to wash in, or, as some would read, to wash at (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It was a handbreadth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1462;&#1428;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;e&#183;p&#772;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
