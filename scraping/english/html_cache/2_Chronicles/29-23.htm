The sin offering is a critical component of the sacrificial system established in Leviticus, specifically in <a href="/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a>, where it is described as a means to atone for unintentional sins. Goats were often used for sin offerings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> during the Day of Atonement. This act signifies the people's acknowledgment of their sins and their desire for purification and reconciliation with God.<p><b>before the king and the assembly</b><br>The presence of the king and the assembly underscores the communal nature of this act of repentance and worship. It highlights the role of leadership in guiding the nation back to faithfulness. The assembly represents the collective body of Israel, emphasizing that the sin offering is not just for individual atonement but for the entire community. This public act of worship and repentance is reminiscent of other national gatherings for covenant renewal, such as in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24</a>.<p><b>who laid their hands on them</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act of identification and transference. In the context of the sin offering, it signifies the transfer of the people's sins onto the goats, which then bear the guilt on behalf of the people. This practice is rooted in Levitical law, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4 and 16</a>:21, and foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity. The act of laying hands also signifies the community's active participation in the sacrificial process, acknowledging their sinfulness and need for atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship after a period of neglect and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The gathered people of Judah who participated in the rededication of the temple and the offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, which Hezekiah cleansed and rededicated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/male_goats_for_the_sin_offering.htm">Male Goats for the Sin Offering</a></b><br>Animals used in the sacrificial system to atone for the sins of the people, symbolizing the transfer of sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/laying_on_of_hands.htm">Laying on of Hands</a></b><br>A symbolic act representing the transfer of sin from the people to the sacrificial animal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance_and_cleansing.htm">The Importance of Repentance and Cleansing</a></b><br>Hezekiah's reforms highlight the need for personal and communal repentance and the cleansing of our lives from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Symbolism of the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The laying on of hands and the sin offering prefigure Christ's ultimate sacrifice, teaching us about the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_renewal.htm">Role of Leadership in Spiritual Renewal</a></b><br>Hezekiah's leadership demonstrates the impact of godly leadership in guiding others toward spiritual renewal and obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement_in_worship.htm">Community Involvement in Worship</a></b><br>The assembly's participation underscores the importance of communal worship and collective responsibility in seeking God's forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/foreshadowing_of_christ's_sacrifice.htm">Foreshadowing of Christ's Sacrifice</a></b><br>The sacrificial system points to Jesus as the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, encouraging us to place our faith in His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_29_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 29:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_29_23_s_atonement_relevance_today.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 29:23 emphasize the importance of atonement for sin today?
