The "high places" were sites of worship often located on elevated ground, where people would offer sacrifices and burn incense, sometimes to Yahweh but often to other gods. These practices were contrary to the centralized worship that God commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>. Hezekiah's removal of these high places and altars was a return to the covenantal faithfulness required by the Law of Moses, emphasizing the exclusive worship of Yahweh. This action was a direct challenge to the syncretistic practices that had crept into Judah, reflecting Hezekiah's commitment to purifying the nation's worship.<p><b>and say to Judah and Jerusalem,</b><br>Hezekiah's reforms were directed towards both Judah, the southern kingdom, and its capital, Jerusalem. This indicates the comprehensive nature of his religious reforms, affecting both the rural areas and the political and spiritual center of the nation. Jerusalem held the temple, the central place of worship, which was to be the focal point of religious life in Israel. By addressing both Judah and Jerusalem, Hezekiah was ensuring that his reforms were implemented throughout the entire kingdom, reinforcing the unity and centralization of worship.<p><b>&#8216;You must worship before one altar,</b><br>The insistence on worshiping before "one altar" refers to the altar in the temple in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>. This centralization of worship was intended to prevent idolatry and ensure that the worship of Yahweh was conducted according to His commandments. The temple in Jerusalem was the designated place for sacrifices and offerings, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This directive was a move towards religious purity and unity, aligning with the covenantal stipulations given to Israel.<p><b>and on it you shall burn sacrifices&#8217;?</b><br>The burning of sacrifices on the altar in Jerusalem was a key aspect of the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law. Sacrifices were a means of atonement, thanksgiving, and worship, pointing to the need for reconciliation with God. This phrase underscores the importance of adhering to the divinely instituted means of worship. In a typological sense, the sacrificial system foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). Hezekiah's reforms, therefore, not only restored proper worship but also pointed forward to the fulfillment of the sacrificial system in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah known for his religious reforms, including the removal of high places and altars dedicated to other gods, centralizing worship in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel and its capital, where Hezekiah implemented his reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places_and_altars.htm">High Places and Altars</a></b><br>Sites of worship that were often used for idolatrous practices.
