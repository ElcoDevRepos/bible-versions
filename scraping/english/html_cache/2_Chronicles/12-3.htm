The use of 1,200 chariots indicates a formidable force, emphasizing the threat posed by Shishak's invasion. Chariots were often used for swift attacks and could turn the tide of battle. In the biblical context, the Israelites were often at a disadvantage against nations with strong chariot forces, as seen in other battles such as those against the Canaanites (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>).<p><b>60,000 horsemen</b><br>The presence of 60,000 horsemen highlights the scale and strength of Shishak's army. Cavalry units were crucial for their speed and mobility, allowing for rapid movements and strategic advantages in battle. This large number of horsemen underscores the military might of Egypt at the time and the serious threat it posed to the Kingdom of Judah. Historically, Egypt was known for its strong cavalry, which played a key role in its military campaigns.<p><b>and countless troops who came with him out of Egypt</b><br>The phrase "countless troops" suggests an overwhelming force, creating a sense of intimidation and inevitability. This vast army would have been a coalition of various groups, reflecting the diverse nature of Shishak's forces. The mention of "countless" emphasizes the seemingly insurmountable odds faced by Rehoboam and Judah. This aligns with other biblical narratives where God's people face overwhelming enemies, such as the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 19).<p><b>Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites</b><br>These groups represent the diverse composition of Shishak's army. The Libyans were from the region west of Egypt, known for their warrior culture. The Sukkites are less well-documented, but they are believed to be a nomadic group possibly from the Sinai or Arabian regions. The Cushites, from the region south of Egypt (modern-day Sudan), were known for their strength and prowess in battle. This coalition reflects the extensive reach and influence of Egypt during Shishak's reign. The inclusion of these groups also highlights the historical alliances and enmities in the region, as well as the fulfillment of God's warnings to Israel about the consequences of disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shishak,_king_of_egypt.htm">Shishak, King of Egypt</a></b><br>The Pharaoh who invaded Judah during the reign of Rehoboam, Solomon's son.

The detailed numbers stress the overwhelming odds; the specific peoples show God&#8217;s reach; and the setting outside Jerusalem recalls Israel&#8217;s past salvation from Egypt now inverted into judgment. Yet the same passage frames hope: when Judah humbles itself (12:6&#8211;7), God relents.

The letter <span class="accented">s</span> is orthographically redundant in this, as also in the following names, the forms being already plural. The <span class="accented">Lubim</span> mean the Libyans, west of Egypt. They are probably the people represented on the Egyptian monuments as <span class="accented">Lebu</span>, of Semitic type, subjugated by Egypt's kings in the <span class="date">thirteenth century B.C.</span> They were among the oldest of colonists, that drifted along the coast of Africa, north of the Great Desert, from the East, and are perhaps the same as the Lehabim (<a href="/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-43.htm">Daniel 11:43</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). <span class="accented">Sukkiims</span>. Probably an Arab tribe, though the Septuagint Version gives <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as though taking them for Troglodytes in the hills west of the Red Sea; so, too, the Vulgate. Gesenius at once renders the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> tent-dwellers, and sets the people in question down for some African tribe. They are not mentioned elsewhere so as to be recognized. <span class="cmt_word">Ethiopians</span>. These were ethnically Cushites, but the territorial application of the term was confined to the African Cushite settlers. It is remarkable that, in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>, Ethiopians are classed with Arabians, but otherwise with African peoples, and in particular Egypt (<a href="/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3, 4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). They were many-tribed, and the Sabaeans were a leading tribe of them. It is evident that Shishak could draw from a large and varied dominion subject to his dynasty at this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">with 1,200</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1444;&#1500;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;lep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
