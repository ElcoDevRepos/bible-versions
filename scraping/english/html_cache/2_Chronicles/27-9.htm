The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of one's lineage. Jotham was a king who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as noted earlier in <a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>, and his reign was marked by stability and prosperity. His death marks the end of a relatively peaceful period in Judah's history.<p><b>and was buried in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to Jerusalem, specifically the southeastern part of the city where the ancient Jebusite city was located. This area became the burial place for the kings of Judah, signifying honor and respect. The burial in the City of David underscores Jotham's legitimacy and his place in the Davidic line, which is significant for the messianic prophecies concerning the lineage of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Archaeological findings in the area have provided insights into the burial practices and the historical context of the Davidic dynasty.<p><b>And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.</b><br>Ahaz's ascension to the throne marks a significant transition in Judah's history. Unlike his father, Ahaz is noted for his unfaithfulness to God, as he engaged in idolatrous practices and sought alliances with foreign powers, which led to spiritual and political decline (<a href="/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2-4</a>). This change in leadership highlights the cyclical nature of the kings of Judah, where periods of faithfulness are often followed by times of apostasy. Ahaz's reign sets the stage for the prophetic ministries of Isaiah and Micah, who called the nation back to covenant faithfulness. The contrast between Jotham and Ahaz serves as a reminder of the importance of godly leadership and its impact on a nation's spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his righteous reign and obedience to God.

Scripture presents death for the covenant child of God as rest, not annihilation (cf. <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;with his fathers&#8221; confirms the continuity of God&#8217;s people across generations; the faithful who die remain part of the same redeemed family (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the chronicler writes under divine inspiration (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), we receive this notice as literal history, affirming God&#8217;s faithfulness to every promise&#8212;even in life&#8217;s closing chapter (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and was buried in the City of David</b><p>&#8226; Jotham&#8217;s burial site&#8212;&#8220;the City of David&#8221; (2 Chron 27:9)&#8212;is Jerusalem&#8217;s royal necropolis, a perpetual reminder that God&#8217;s covenant with David remains intact (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; 7:16).<p>&#8226; Royal burials marked the king&#8217;s legitimacy and underscored Judah&#8217;s unbroken line all the way to the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike some kings who were denied an honored burial because of blatant rebellion (2 Chron 21:19&#8211;20), Jotham receives full royal honors, reflecting the righteous reign summarized in 2 Chron 27:2&#8211;3.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his son Ahaz reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; The throne passes immediately to Ahaz, underscoring God&#8217;s sovereign control over succession (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). A stable transfer of power fulfills the promise that &#8220;your house and kingdom will endure forever&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Sadly, the next chapter shows Ahaz abandoning his father&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/16-1.htm">2 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>; 2 Chron 28:1&#8211;4). This sober contrast proves that godliness is not inherited; each generation must choose obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in Ahaz&#8217;s apostasy, God preserves the line so that, centuries later, Jesus&#8212;the greater Son of David&#8212;may take His rightful throne (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/27-9.htm">2 Chronicles 27:9</a> records three linked realities: Jotham&#8217;s peaceful death, his honorable burial within David&#8217;s city, and the orderly rise of his son Ahaz. Together they highlight God&#8217;s faithfulness to individual believers, to the Davidic covenant, and to His overarching redemptive plan. The verse invites us to rest in the certainty that every life event&#8212;birth, reign, death, and succession&#8212;unfolds under the steady hand of the Lord who keeps His promises from generation to generation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/27-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Jotham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3147.htm">Strong's 3147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jotham -- 'the LORD is perfect', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
