It emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of God's plan. The command to "march down" indicates a proactive stance, despite the overwhelming odds. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where faith requires action, as seen in the story of Joshua and the walls of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>You will see them coming up the Ascent of Ziz,</b><br>The Ascent of Ziz is a geographical location that provides a strategic vantage point. It is believed to be a pass or a slope leading up from the Dead Sea area. This detail underscores God's omniscience, as He knows the enemy's movements. The specificity of the location reassures the Israelites of God's control over the situation, similar to how God guided the Israelites through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>).<p><b>and you will find them at the end of the valley</b><br>The valley mentioned here is likely a strategic location for battle. Valleys in biblical times were often sites of significant encounters, such as the Valley of Elah where David fought Goliath (1 Samuel 17). This phrase suggests that God has already determined the outcome of the battle, providing assurance of victory.<p><b>facing the Wilderness of Jeruel.</b><br>The Wilderness of Jeruel is a less-known location, but its mention indicates a specific area where the enemy will be positioned. Wildernesses in the Bible often symbolize places of testing and divine intervention, as seen in the Israelites' journey through the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).
