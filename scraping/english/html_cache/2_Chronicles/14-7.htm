Asa is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. His address to the people signifies a call to action and unity under his leadership, emphasizing the importance of collective effort in the nation's security and prosperity.<p><b>&#8220;Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars.</b><br>The construction of fortified cities was a common practice in ancient times for protection against invasions. Walls and towers provided defense and surveillance, while doors and bars ensured controlled access. This reflects a strategic approach to national security, emphasizing preparedness and vigilance. The mention of building cities also indicates a period of peace and stability, allowing for infrastructure development.<p><b>The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God.</b><br>This statement highlights the theological perspective that the land's possession is directly linked to the people's faithfulness to God. Seeking the LORD implies a commitment to His commandments and reliance on His guidance. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience results in blessings, including territorial security.<p><b>We have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of "rest" in this context refers to peace and freedom from conflict, a blessing attributed to divine favor. This rest is seen as a reward for seeking God, aligning with the Deuteronomic principle that obedience leads to peace and prosperity. The phrase "on every side" suggests comprehensive security, indicating that Judah was not threatened by neighboring nations at this time.<p><b>So they built and prospered.</b><br>The result of seeking God and securing the land is prosperity, both in terms of economic growth and societal stability. Building projects would have stimulated the economy, provided employment, and enhanced the nation's infrastructure. Prosperity here is seen as a direct consequence of divine blessing, reinforcing the idea that faithfulness to God leads to tangible benefits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation in a period of religious reform and military strengthening.
