This choice aligns with the laws given in the Torah, where Israelites were not to be enslaved by their own people (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-42</a>). Solomon's reign was marked by prosperity and peace, allowing him to employ foreign labor for his extensive building projects, including the Temple and his palace (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>). This decision also highlights the distinction between the Israelites and the non-Israelite populations within the kingdom, who were often conscripted for labor.<p><b>because they were his men of war</b><br>The Israelites were primarily designated as warriors, reflecting their role in defending the nation and maintaining peace. This military organization was crucial for Solomon's kingdom, which enjoyed a period of unprecedented peace and security (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24-25</a>). The emphasis on military roles underscores the importance of a strong defense in maintaining the stability and prosperity of the kingdom. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a divine warrior who fights for His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>).<p><b>the leaders of his captains</b><br>The leaders of the captains were likely high-ranking military officials responsible for overseeing various divisions of the army. This structure indicates a well-organized military hierarchy, essential for effective governance and defense. The mention of these leaders highlights the importance of leadership and order within the kingdom, reflecting the wisdom and administrative skills attributed to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>).<p><b>and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry</b><br>Chariots and cavalry were significant components of ancient Near Eastern military forces, providing mobility and strength in battle. Solomon's investment in chariots and cavalry demonstrates his commitment to maintaining a formidable military presence. This military prowess is echoed in other parts of Scripture, where chariots are often associated with power and might (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).
