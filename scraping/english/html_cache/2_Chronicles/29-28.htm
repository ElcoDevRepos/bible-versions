The term "assembly" refers to the gathered congregation, which included priests, Levites, and laypeople. This communal worship reflects the unity and dedication of the people in returning to the worship of Yahweh under King Hezekiah's reforms. Historically, this was a significant moment as it marked a revival of true worship after periods of idolatry. The concept of assembly worship is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to gather together (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p><b>The singers were singing</b><br>The role of singers in temple worship was crucial, as music was an integral part of Israelite worship. The Levites were often appointed as singers, and their role was to lead the people in praise and worship through song. This practice can be traced back to King David, who organized the Levitical musicians (<a href="/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>). Singing in worship is a theme that runs throughout the Bible, emphasizing the importance of music in expressing devotion and adoration to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a>).<p><b>And the trumpeters were playing</b><br>Trumpeters, also Levites, played a significant role in temple ceremonies. The use of trumpets in worship can be traced back to the instructions given to Moses (<a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>). Trumpets were used to signal important events, call the assembly, and accompany sacrifices. In this context, the trumpeters' playing signifies the solemnity and grandeur of the worship service. The sound of trumpets is also associated with divine revelation and the presence of God, as seen in the giving of the Law at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>).<p><b>All this continued until the burnt offering was completed</b><br>The burnt offering was a central element of Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. It was a sacrifice that was wholly consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God. The continuation of worship until the offering was completed underscores the importance of the sacrifice in the worship service. This act of worship points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself as a once-for-all atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The completion of the burnt offering signifies the fulfillment of the sacrificial system in Christ's perfect sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The gathered people of Judah who participated in the worship and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_singers_and_trumpeters.htm">The Singers and Trumpeters</a></b><br>Levites appointed to lead musical worship in the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_corporate_worship.htm">The Importance of Corporate Worship</a></b><br>Worship is a communal activity that involves the whole assembly, emphasizing unity and collective devotion to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_music_in_worship.htm">Role of Music in Worship</a></b><br>Music, through singers and trumpeters, plays a vital role in worship, enhancing the expression of praise and adoration to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_sacrificial_offerings.htm">Significance of Sacrificial Offerings</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes total dedication and atonement, reminding believers of the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_in_worship.htm">Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>Hezekiah's leadership in restoring temple worship highlights the importance of godly leadership in guiding others towards true worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_worship.htm">Perseverance in Worship</a></b><br>The continuous nature of the worship until the offering was completed teaches perseverance and commitment in our spiritual practices.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_29_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 29:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_29_28_Worship_s_vital_role.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 29:28 emphasize the importance of worship in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_music_in_2_Chronicles_29_28.htm">What role does music play in worship according to 2 Chronicles 29:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Add_singing_trumpets_to_worship.htm">How can we incorporate "singing" and "trumpets" into our modern worship practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_link_to_Psalm_150.htm">How does this verse connect with Psalm 150's call to worship with instruments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_unity_in_worship_from_2_Chr_29_28.htm">What can we learn about unity in worship from 2 Chronicles 29:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Chron_29_28_Worship_s_OT_significance.htm">What does 2 Chronicles 29:28 reveal about the importance of worship in the Old Testament?

In <a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8&#8211;11</a> trumpets again signal divine action, showing continuity from temple worship to final redemption.<p>&#8226; The coordinated voices and horns portray ordered, enthusiastic worship that exalts God, not performers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All this continued until the burnt offering was completed</b><p>&#8226; Verse 27 notes the burnt offering began &#8220;when the sacrifice began, the song of the LORD also began.&#8221; Worship didn&#8217;t pause until the last piece of the sacrifice was consumed.<p>&#8226; The burnt offering symbolized total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). Likewise, <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices.<p>&#8226; Continuous praise during the entire sacrifice points to the sufficiency and finality of Christ&#8217;s once-for-all offering (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12&#8211;14</a>). Worship surrounds the cross: it flows from His work and endures because His atonement is complete (&#8220;It is finished,&#8221; <a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse paints a vivid picture of wholehearted, orderly, God-centered worship&#8212;everyone involved, singers lifting melody, priests sounding trumpets, all sustained until the sacrifice was fully offered. It teaches that true praise is corporate, joyful, and deeply anchored in the atoning work God provides. Our own gatherings echo this pattern when every believer engages, gifted leaders serve, and all honor the finished sacrifice of Christ that makes our worship acceptable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Worshipped.</span>--<span class= "ital">Were worshipping.</span> LXX. <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span><span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">singers.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the song.</span> So we might say "<span class= "ital">the music</span> was playing;" or even "the song was singing," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> being sung.<p><span class= "bld">The trumpeters sounded.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the clarions were blowing</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">clarioning</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The participle is masculine, although the noun is properly feminine, because here the word "clarions" really stands for the clarion-players.
