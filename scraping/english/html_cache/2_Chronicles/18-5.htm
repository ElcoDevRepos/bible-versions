The number "four hundred" is significant, suggesting a complete or substantial group, though not necessarily indicating true prophets of Yahweh. These prophets were likely court prophets, who often told the king what he wanted to hear, rather than delivering genuine messages from God. This assembly contrasts with the solitary true prophet, Micaiah, who later speaks the truth. The gathering of such a large number of prophets highlights the influence and power of the monarchy over religious practices at the time.<p><b>and asked them, &#8220;Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?&#8221;</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, indicating its religious significance. Historically, it had been a point of contention between Israel and Aram (Syria). Ahab's inquiry reflects the common practice of seeking divine guidance before military campaigns, though his choice of prophets suggests he was more interested in affirmation than genuine divine counsel. This question also sets the stage for the conflict between Ahab's desires and God's will, as revealed through Micaiah.<p><b>&#8220;Go up,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.&#8221;</b><br>The unanimous response of the prophets indicates their role as sycophants, providing Ahab with the assurance he sought. Their message, claiming divine support, is later revealed to be false, as Micaiah exposes their deception. This reflects the broader biblical theme of false prophets who lead people astray by speaking what is pleasing rather than what is true. The phrase "God will deliver it" falsely attributes divine sanction to Ahab's plans, contrasting with the true prophetic word that comes from Micaiah. This situation foreshadows the ultimate failure of Ahab's campaign and serves as a warning against relying on false assurances rather than seeking genuine divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to King Ahab, who was known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Four hundred men who claimed to speak for God but were likely false prophets, as they unanimously agreed without seeking the true will of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth-gilead.htm">Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>A city of strategic importance, located in the territory of Gilead, which was contested between Israel and Aram.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah, who was allied with Ahab through marriage and was present during this consultation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The true God of Israel, whose will was not genuinely sought by Ahab's prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_seeking_counsel.htm">Discernment in Seeking Counsel</a></b><br>It is crucial to seek counsel from those who genuinely know and follow God.
