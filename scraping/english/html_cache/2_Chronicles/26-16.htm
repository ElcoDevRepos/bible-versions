His reign was marked by military success, economic prosperity, and significant building projects, which contributed to his power. This period of strength and expansion is reminiscent of the blessings promised to Israel for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). However, power often brings the temptation of pride, a recurring theme in the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>his arrogance led to his own destruction</b><br>Uzziah's pride is a cautionary tale about the dangers of self-exaltation. His downfall is a fulfillment of the biblical principle that pride precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This mirrors the fate of other biblical figures who fell due to pride, such as King Saul and Nebuchadnezzar. Uzziah's story serves as a warning against the sin of pride, which is considered an abomination to God (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>).<p><b>He was unfaithful to the LORD his God</b><br>Uzziah's unfaithfulness is a breach of the covenant relationship with God, which required exclusive worship and obedience. This act of unfaithfulness is akin to spiritual adultery, a theme frequently addressed by the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>). Uzziah's actions reflect a heart that has turned away from God, similar to the Israelites' repeated cycles of faithfulness and apostasy in the book of Judges.<p><b>for he entered the temple of the LORD</b><br>The temple was the sacred dwelling place of God, and only the priests, descendants of Aaron, were permitted to perform duties within it (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). Uzziah's entry into the temple signifies a blatant disregard for God's established order and a usurpation of priestly duties. This act can be compared to King Saul's unlawful sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>), highlighting the importance of obedience over presumption.<p><b>to burn incense on the altar of incense</b><br>Burning incense was a priestly duty, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). Uzziah's attempt to perform this act was a direct violation of the Levitical law (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). This incident foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who alone mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). Uzziah's presumption contrasts with Christ's obedience and rightful priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

Victory over the Philistines, fortified cities, and a well-equipped army (26:6-15) followed. Yet success created a spiritual crossroads: <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a> warns that abundance can tempt a person to say, &#8220;My own power and the strength of my hands have gained this wealth.&#8221; The verse opens by marking that very turning point&#8212;power became a test of character, not merely a blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his arrogance led to his own destruction</b><p>&#8226; Pride and downfall are inseparable in Scripture: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Uzziah&#8217;s story illustrates how inner attitudes shape outward outcomes; the text links arrogance directly to ruin, not to mere misfortune.<p>&#8226; God resists the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>); therefore, the moment Uzziah exalted himself, he positioned himself against the One who had exalted him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was unfaithful to the LORD his God</b><p>Unfaithfulness here is covenant treachery&#8212;turning from the God who gave the throne. Earlier kings such as Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>) followed the same tragic pattern. Faithfulness is measured not by popularity or military wins but by obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). By stepping outside his God-given role, Uzziah broke fellowship with the LORD even before any visible discipline appeared.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he entered the temple of the LORD</b><p>The temple was holy space. <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a> assigns its service exclusively to Aaron&#8217;s sons: &#8220;Any outsider who approaches must be put to death.&#8221; Kings governed; priests ministered. When Uzziah crossed that line, he pushed into a realm where only consecrated priests could stand (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>). The separation of offices protected both national order and personal safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to burn incense on the altar of incense</b><p>Incense symbolized the prayers of the people rising before God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). According to <a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>, only Aaronic priests were authorized to burn it. Uzziah&#8217;s attempt echoed Saul&#8217;s unlawful sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>) and Nadab and Abihu&#8217;s &#8220;unauthorized fire&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). The very act he coveted became the means of judgment: priests confronted him, and leprosy broke out on his forehead (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18-21</a>). God guarded His worship, defending both His glory and the priestly picture that ultimately points to Christ, our only rightful Mediator (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a> teaches that success can incubate pride; pride breeds unfaithfulness; unfaithfulness oversteps God&#8217;s boundaries; and overstepping invites judgment. Uzziah&#8217;s downfall calls every believer to remain humble, honor God-ordained roles, and guard the sanctity of worship, remembering that blessings prosper only while hearts stay surrendered to the LORD who gives them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">UZZIAH'S PRESUMPTION PUNISHED BY LEPROSY HIS DEATH</span><p>(<a href="/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2Chronicles 26:16-23</a>).<p>This section also is mainly peculiar to the chronicler. <a href="/context/2_kings/15-5.htm" title="And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house.
