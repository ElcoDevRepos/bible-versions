It reflects the king's dedication and generosity, as he provides from his own resources. In the context of ancient Israel, a king's wealth was often measured by his livestock, indicating Josiah's substantial commitment to the religious observance. This act of giving from personal possessions can be seen as a model of leadership and devotion, reminiscent of David's offerings for the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a>).<p><b>Josiah contributed 30,000 lambs and goats</b><br>The large number of lambs and goats signifies the scale of the Passover celebration under Josiah's reign. The Passover lamb is a central element of the festival, symbolizing the sacrifice that spared the Israelites during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-13</a>). The provision of such a vast number of animals ensured that all participants could partake in the feast, emphasizing inclusivity and communal worship. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>plus 3,000 bulls</b><br>The inclusion of bulls in the offerings is significant, as bulls were often used in major sacrificial rituals, such as burnt offerings and peace offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-5</a>). The number of bulls provided by Josiah underscores the grandeur and solemnity of the occasion. Bulls were considered valuable and were a symbol of strength and service, reflecting the king's desire to honor God with the best of his resources.<p><b>for the Passover offerings</b><br>The Passover was one of the most important festivals in the Jewish calendar, commemorating the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage. The offerings were central to the celebration, serving as a reminder of God's salvation and covenant with His people. Josiah's contributions ensured that the Passover was observed according to the Law of Moses, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16.htm">Deuteronomy 16</a>, reinforcing the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>for all the people who were present</b><br>This phrase indicates the inclusivity of the celebration, as Josiah's provisions were intended for all who attended, not just the elite or priestly class. It reflects a communal aspect of worship, where the entire nation could participate in the remembrance of God's deliverance. This inclusivity mirrors the New Testament teaching that salvation through Christ is available to all people, regardless of status or background (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who reigned from approximately 640 to 609 BC.
