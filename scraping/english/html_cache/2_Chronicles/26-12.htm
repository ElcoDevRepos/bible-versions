The term "family leaders" suggests that these were heads of clans or extended families, responsible for leading their kin in battle. This reflects the tribal organization of ancient Israelite society, where leadership often passed through familial lines. The concept of family leadership is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the division of the land among the tribes in the book of Joshua.<p><b>of the mighty men of valor</b><br>"Mighty men of valor" refers to elite warriors known for their bravery and skill in battle. This term is used frequently in the Old Testament to describe warriors who were not only physically strong but also courageous and loyal. These men were crucial to the military success of Israel and Judah, as seen in the exploits of David's mighty men in <a href="/2_samuel/23.htm">2 Samuel 23</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of valor and strength in the defense and expansion of the kingdom, reflecting the biblical theme of God empowering His people to achieve victory.<p><b>was 2,600</b><br>The specific number, 2,600, highlights the significant size and strength of King Uzziah's military force. This number indicates a well-organized and substantial leadership structure, capable of commanding a large army. In the context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, having such a number of leaders suggests a formidable military presence. This organization and strength would have been necessary for the various military campaigns and defensive measures undertaken by Uzziah, as described earlier in <a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>.
