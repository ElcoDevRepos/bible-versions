The phrase "next to him" indicates a position of importance and proximity to the king, suggesting Amasiah's significant role in the military hierarchy. The name Amasiah means "Jehovah is strength," reflecting a common practice of the time to incorporate the name of God into personal names, signifying faith and reliance on divine power. Zichri, Amasiah's father, is a name that appears multiple times in the Old Testament, indicating a possible lineage of notable figures, though specific details about this Zichri are not provided. This highlights the importance of family heritage and legacy in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>the volunteer for the LORD</b><br>Amasiah is described as a "volunteer for the LORD," which emphasizes his willing and devoted service to God. This phrase suggests a sense of personal commitment and dedication beyond mere duty. In the context of ancient Israel, volunteering for the LORD would imply a readiness to serve in religious or military capacities, often seen as acts of faith and loyalty to God. This concept of voluntary service is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the stories of the judges and prophets who answered God's call willingly. It also prefigures the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor</b><br>The mention of "200,000 mighty men of valor" indicates a substantial and formidable military force. The term "mighty men of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe warriors of exceptional strength, courage, and skill, often associated with King David's elite warriors (2 Samuel 23). This large number reflects the strength and preparedness of Judah's army under Jehoshaphat's reign, a time marked by religious reforms and military fortification. The emphasis on valor and might underscores the importance of military prowess in maintaining the security and stability of the kingdom. This also serves as a reminder of the biblical theme that true strength and victory come from reliance on God, as seen in the stories of Gideon and David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amasiah.htm">Amasiah</a></b><br>Amasiah is described as a "volunteer for the LORD."
