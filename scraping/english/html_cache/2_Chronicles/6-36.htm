The Bible repeatedly emphasizes that all have sinned (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). In the context of 2 Chronicles, Solomon is praying during the dedication of the temple, recognizing the people's propensity to sin and the need for divine forgiveness.<p><b>for there is no one who does not sin</b><br>This universal truth is echoed in other parts of the Bible, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20 and 1</a> <a href="/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8</a>. It underscores the fallen nature of humanity and the need for a savior. This acknowledgment of universal sinfulness sets the stage for the necessity of Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>and You become angry with them</b><br>God's anger is a response to sin and disobedience, reflecting His holiness and justice. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger often leads to corrective action, intended to bring His people back to righteousness. This is seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and repentance in the book of Judges.<p><b>and deliver them to an enemy</b><br>This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to consequences, including subjugation by foreign powers. Historical instances include the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, which were seen as divine judgments for Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>who takes them as captives</b><br>The concept of captivity is significant in Israel's history, notably the Babylonian exile. Captivity serves as both punishment and a means of purification, leading the people to repentance and eventual restoration. It also foreshadows spiritual captivity to sin, from which Christ delivers believers.<p><b>to a land far or near</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of God's judgment, which can reach any distance. Historically, Israel was taken captive to lands both near (such as Egypt) and far (such as Babylon). It highlights God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to use them as instruments of His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

The parallel is well worthy of being referred to, in its vers. 50, 51. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/6-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they sin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1462;&#1495;&#1462;&#1496;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ye&#183;&#7717;e&#7789;&#183;&#8217;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against You&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
