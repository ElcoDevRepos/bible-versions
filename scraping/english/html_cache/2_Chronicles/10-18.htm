His decision to send Hadoram, also known as Adoram, reflects his attempt to assert authority over the northern tribes. Hadoram's role as overseer of forced labor connects to the heavy burdens placed on the Israelites during Solomon's reign, which had caused discontent among the people (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). This act demonstrates Rehoboam's failure to heed the elders' advice to lighten the people's load, leading to further division. The use of forced labor was common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies, often involving conscripted labor for royal projects.<p><b>but the Israelites stoned him to death</b><br>The stoning of Hadoram signifies the Israelites' outright rejection of Rehoboam's authority and their deep-seated resentment towards the oppressive labor policies. Stoning was a traditional form of execution in ancient Israel, often used for severe offenses (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>). This violent act marks a pivotal moment in the division of the united monarchy, as it underscores the northern tribes' determination to break away from Rehoboam's rule. The stoning also fulfills the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah, indicating the tearing away of ten tribes from Solomon's lineage (<a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31</a>).<p><b>And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem</b><br>Rehoboam's hasty retreat to Jerusalem highlights his lack of control and the immediate threat to his reign. Jerusalem, the capital of the southern kingdom of Judah, becomes his refuge and the center of his diminished rule. This escape underscores the rapid unraveling of the united kingdom and the fulfillment of God's judgment against Solomon's house due to idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). The division of the kingdom into Israel (north) and Judah (south) sets the stage for the subsequent history of both kingdoms, with Jerusalem remaining the spiritual and political heart of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_rehoboam.htm">King Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Judah, whose harsh policies led to the division of the united kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadoram.htm">Hadoram</a></b><br>Also known as Adoram, he was in charge of forced labor under King Rehoboam.

The stoning of Hadoram and Rehoboam&#8217;s flight seal the division of the kingdom, fulfilling earlier warnings and prophecies.
