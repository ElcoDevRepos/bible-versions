Judah and Jerusalem were the southern kingdom and its capital, respectively, during the divided monarchy in Israel. The speaker is addressing the entire community, highlighting the collective nature of the impending challenge. This reflects the communal aspect of faith in ancient Israel, where the fate of the nation was often seen as intertwined with the spiritual state of its people.<p><b>Listen, King Jehoshaphat!</b><br>King Jehoshaphat was the fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah and is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh. His inclusion in the address underscores the importance of leadership in spiritual and national matters. Jehoshaphat's reign is marked by a reliance on God, as seen in his previous actions of seeking divine guidance (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-4.htm">2 Chronicles 18:4</a>).<p><b>This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase introduces a prophetic message, indicating that the words to follow are not merely human advice but divine instruction. In the Old Testament, prophets often prefaced their messages with such declarations to affirm their authority and the divine origin of their message. This underscores the belief in God's active involvement in the affairs of His people.<p><b>&#8216;Do not be afraid or discouraged</b><br>Fear and discouragement are common human responses to overwhelming situations. This reassurance is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God often tells His people not to fear (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). It reflects God's understanding of human frailty and His desire to provide comfort and strength.<p><b>because of this vast army,</b><br>The "vast army" refers to the coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites that had come against Judah. Historically, these were neighboring nations often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The mention of a vast army highlights the seemingly insurmountable odds faced by Judah, setting the stage for a demonstration of divine intervention.<p><b>for the battle does not belong to you,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the concept of divine sovereignty and intervention. It reassures the people that the outcome does not depend on their military might or strategy. This is a common biblical theme, where God fights on behalf of His people (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><b>but to God.</b><br>The conclusion of the message places the responsibility and outcome of the battle in God's hands. It is a call to faith and trust in God's power and plan. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God as the ultimate protector and deliverer of His people, foreshadowing the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ, who battles sin and death on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who sought the Lord's guidance when faced with a formidable enemy alliance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, representing God's chosen people who were under threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vast_army.htm">The Vast Army</a></b><br>A coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and others who came to wage war against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_jahaziel.htm">The Prophet Jahaziel</a></b><br>A Levite who delivered God's message of assurance to Jehoshaphat and the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_berakah.htm">The Valley of Berakah</a></b><br>The place where the people of Judah later gathered to praise God for their victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control, even when circumstances seem overwhelming.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/do_not_fear.htm">Do Not Fear</a></b><br>Fear can paralyze us, but faith in God's promises empowers us to face challenges with confidence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_battle,_not_ours.htm">God's Battle, Not Ours</a></b><br>Understand that spiritual battles are fought by God on our behalf; our role is to trust and obey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_god's_guidance.htm">Seek God's Guidance</a></b><br>Like Jehoshaphat, seek God's direction through prayer and His Word when facing life's battles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_and_worship_as_warfare.htm">Praise and Worship as Warfare</a></b><br>Use praise and worship as tools to shift focus from the problem to the Problem-Solver.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Chronicles_20_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Chronicles 20:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Chronicles_20_15_Rely_on_God_s_strength.htm">How does 2 Chronicles 20:15 encourage reliance on God's strength in battles?
