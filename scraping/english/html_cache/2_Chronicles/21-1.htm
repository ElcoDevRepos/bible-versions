The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. Jehoshaphat was known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>. His reign was marked by prosperity and military success, attributed to his faithfulness to God. The phrase also reflects the belief in an afterlife where the faithful are gathered to their forebears.<p><b>and was buried with them in the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, where the kings of Judah were traditionally buried. This burial location signifies honor and legitimacy, as it connects Jehoshaphat to the Davidic line, which is central to the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament. The City of David is an archaeological site today, providing insights into the period's burial practices and the historical reality of the Davidic dynasty. The burial of kings in this location underscores the continuity of the Davidic covenant, which is foundational to the hope of a future Messiah.<p><b>And his son Jehoram reigned in his place.</b><br>Jehoram's ascension to the throne marks a significant transition in Judah's history. Unlike his father, Jehoram's reign was characterized by idolatry and political instability, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4-6</a>. His marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, introduced Baal worship into Judah, leading to spiritual decline. This phrase highlights the biblical theme of the consequences of turning away from God, as Jehoram's reign resulted in divine judgment and national turmoil. The transition also serves as a reminder of the importance of godly leadership and the impact of personal choices on a nation's spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>A king of Judah known for his faithfulness to God and efforts to rid the land of idolatry.

To understand the questions set in motion by the last clause of the verse, comparison must be made of <a href="/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>. For anything that appears here, we should take for granted that Jehoram now first began to exercise any royal authority and enjoy any royal dignity. But the first of the just-quoted passages says Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded his wicked brother Ahaziah in the <span class="accented">second year</span> of Jehoram (of Judah), son of Jehoshaphat. In the second of the above-quoted passages, however, we are told that the same Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded to the throne in the <span class="accented">eighteenth</span> year of Jehoshaphat, which date tallies with our parallel of last chapter (<a href="/1_kings/22-41.htm">1 Kings 22:41</a>), to the effect that Jehoshaphat himself began to reign in Ahab's fourth year, and Ahaziah in Jeho-saphat's seventeenth year. While, lastly, the third of the above-quoted references says that in the fifth year of Joram (of Israel), "Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah" (which, however, is itself an unfaithful rendering of what must be a corrupt text), his son Jehoram "began to reign." It has therefore been conjectured that the royal name was given Jehoram (of Judah) by his father in his father's sixteenth year, and that in his twenty-third year he further invested him with some royal power (our ver. 3 gives some plausibility to this conjecture), from which last date Jehoram's "eight years" (<a href="/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>) must be reckoned; this was not less than two years before the death of Jehoshaphat. Were it not for the countenance that our third verse (describing the cut-and-dried arrangements that the father made for his sons) gives to the tenableness of the above conjectures, we should prefer the conjecture that the passages commented upon are so much corrupt text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_chronicles/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1496;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3092.htm">Strong's 3092: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoshaphat -- 'the LORD has judged', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ka&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
