This phrase highlights the stubbornness and pride that often precedes a fall. In the broader biblical narrative, listening to God is equated with wisdom and obedience, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a> and <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>. Amaziah's refusal to listen is a cautionary tale about the consequences of ignoring God's guidance.<p><b>for this had come from God</b><br>This phrase underscores the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations and individuals. It reflects the biblical principle that God can use even the disobedience of His people to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>. Theologically, it suggests that God's plans are ultimately beyond human understanding, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours.<p><b>in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash</b><br>Jehoash, the king of Israel, becomes an instrument of God's judgment against Judah. This reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign powers to discipline His people, similar to how He used Babylon to judge Judah later in history (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The historical context here is the divided kingdom, where Israel and Judah were often at odds, and God used these conflicts to bring about His purposes.<p><b>because they had sought the gods of Edom</b><br>Amaziah's idolatry is the root cause of his downfall. The gods of Edom represent the temptation of syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh is mixed with pagan practices, a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This idolatry is a direct violation of the first commandment and serves as a reminder of the spiritual adultery that leads to divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. The Edomites, descendants of Esau, were long-standing enemies of Israel, and their gods symbolized a rejection of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.
