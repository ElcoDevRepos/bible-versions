It is often used in Scripture to introduce a significant statement or revelation, urging the audience to consider the gravity of the situation.<p><b>this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword,</b><br>The reference to "our fathers" indicates the previous generations of Israelites who suffered defeat in battle. This phrase highlights the consequences of disobedience to God's commandments, as seen throughout the history of Israel. The "sword" symbolizes warfare and divine judgment, often resulting from the nation's idolatry and abandonment of God's laws.

This was a direct result of the nation's sin and failure to uphold the covenant with God. The mention of "sons and daughters and wives" underscores the personal and communal impact of this judgment, affecting families and future generations.

Hezekiah puts a spotlight on present national pain so no one can shrug it off. Similar wake-up calls appear in <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a> &#8220;But Israel does not understand,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a> &#8220;You do not realize that you are wretched.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By opening with this summons, the king affirms that what follows is not speculation; it is God&#8217;s clear verdict on Judah&#8217;s condition, in line with <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a> where onlookers &#8220;will say&#8230; &#8216;Why has the LORD done this to this land?&#8217;&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword</b><p>&#8226; Hezekiah directly links the recent battlefield losses to covenant unfaithfulness. The people abandoned the temple (2 Chron 28:24) and chased idols (2 Chron 28:2-3). God&#8217;s warnings in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>&#8212;&#8220;You will be defeated before your enemies&#8221;&#8212;were literally fulfilled.<p>&#8226; Listing &#8220;our fathers&#8221; underscores collective accountability.

It is their sin, not His caprice, that opened the door to judgment, echoing <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a> &#8220;Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity</b><p>&#8226; The captivity of families shows the depth of the national wound. Enemy forces carried off tens of thousands (2 Chron 28:8). This fulfilled <a href="/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a> &#8220;Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation,&#8221; proving Scripture&#8217;s reliability.<p>&#8226; Mentioning vulnerable loved ones personalizes the cost of rebellion: broken homes, shattered hopes, and a future mortgaged to foreign powers. <a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1-3</a> captures the grief of captives who &#8220;sat and wept.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Captivity also hints at God&#8217;s mercy. When people recognize the consequences, they can repent and be restored (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>; 2 Chron 30:9 &#8220;for the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate&#8221;). Hezekiah is preparing hearts for revival by pointing to where disobedience leads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/29-9.htm">2 Chronicles 29:9</a> is Hezekiah&#8217;s blunt diagnosis: national defeat and family captivity are the direct, covenant-promised result of turning away from the LORD. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to face the painful evidence, admit sin&#8217;s high price, and return to wholehearted obedience, confident that the same faithful God who judged will also redeem when they repent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For.</span>--<span class= "ital">And.</span> (See <a href="/context/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus.
