Jehoshaphat was a reformer king who sought to bring the nation back to the worship of Yahweh. The appointment of judges was part of his efforts to establish justice and righteousness in the land, reflecting the judicial system outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>. The role of judges was crucial in maintaining social order and ensuring that the laws of God were upheld.<p><b>Consider carefully what you do</b><br>Jehoshaphat's admonition to the judges emphasizes the gravity and responsibility of their role. The Hebrew concept of justice is deeply rooted in the character of God, who is just and righteous. Judges were to reflect God's justice, making decisions that were fair and impartial. This call to careful consideration is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>, which states that doing what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.<p><b>for you are not judging for man</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine accountability of the judges. Their judgments were not merely civil or societal but were seen as acts of service to God. This perspective elevates the role of a judge from a mere public servant to a representative of divine justice. It underscores the biblical principle that all authority is established by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>), and those in positions of authority are ultimately accountable to Him.<p><b>but for the LORD</b><br>Judges were to see themselves as executing God's justice, not merely human justice. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the ultimate judge (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>). The judges were to act as His agents, ensuring that their decisions reflected His will and character. This divine perspective on justice is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God is often depicted as the defender of the oppressed and the upholder of righteousness.<p><b>who is with you when you render judgment</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is significant. It implies that God is actively involved in the process of justice, guiding and supporting those who seek to uphold His laws. This echoes the promise of God's presence with His people, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>. The presence of God with the judges serves as both a comfort and a warning, reminding them of their sacred duty and the divine oversight of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated reforms to bring the nation back to the worship of Yahweh.
