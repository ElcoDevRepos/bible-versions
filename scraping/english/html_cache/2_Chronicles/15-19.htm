In the context of the Old Testament, peace is often seen as a blessing from God, a result of obedience and faithfulness to His commandments. The absence of war suggests a time of stability and prosperity for the kingdom of Judah under King Asa's rule. This peace can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to His people when they follow His ways, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, where God promises peace in the land if the Israelites obey Him.<p><b>until the thirty-fifth year</b><br>The specific mention of the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign provides a chronological marker that helps to situate this period of peace within the larger historical context of the divided kingdom. Asa's reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14 and 15</a>. The thirty-fifth year marks a significant duration of peace, indicating the effectiveness of Asa's reforms and his reliance on God. This timeframe also serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of Israel's history, where periods of faithfulness and peace are often followed by times of disobedience and conflict.<p><b>of Asa&#8217;s reign</b><br>King Asa was the third king of the Kingdom of Judah and is remembered for his commitment to religious reform and his efforts to rid the land of idolatry. His reign is characterized by a return to the worship of the Lord and the removal of foreign altars and high places. Asa's leadership is often contrasted with that of other kings who led Israel and Judah into idolatry. His reign is a type of Christ in that he sought to purify the worship of God and lead his people in righteousness, reflecting the ultimate purification and leadership that Christ brings. Asa's reliance on God during his reign, especially in times of conflict, is a model of faith and dependence on divine strength rather than human power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.
