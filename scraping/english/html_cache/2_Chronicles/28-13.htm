The context is the aftermath of a battle where the Northern Kingdom of Israel had defeated Judah and taken captives. The leaders, recognizing the moral and spiritual implications, urge the army not to bring the captives into their territory. This reflects a moment of conscience and awareness of God's laws, which prohibited the mistreatment of fellow Israelites (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>). It also shows a rare instance of compassion and adherence to divine principles during a period of widespread apostasy.<p><b>&#8220;for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us from the LORD&#8221;</b><br>The leaders acknowledge that their actions could incur divine wrath. In the Old Testament, guilt often refers to the state of being liable for punishment due to sin. The Israelites were aware that their actions were accountable to God, who had established a covenant with them. This reflects the understanding that sin has communal consequences, not just individual ones, as seen in other instances like Achan's sin in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>. The leaders' awareness of potential guilt indicates a recognition of the seriousness of violating God's commands.<p><b>&#8220;and to add to our sins and our guilt.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the cumulative nature of sin. The leaders recognize that their nation is already burdened with sin, and adding to it would exacerbate their situation. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has a compounding effect, leading to greater separation from God. The acknowledgment of existing sin suggests a consciousness of their spiritual state, which is crucial for repentance. It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to reason together and find forgiveness.<p><b>&#8220;For our guilt is great,&#8221;</b><br>The leaders confess the magnitude of their guilt, indicating a deep awareness of their spiritual condition. This admission is significant because it shows a moment of humility and recognition of their need for divine mercy. The acknowledgment of great guilt is a step towards repentance, as seen in the prayers of confession in <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a> and <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>. It underscores the biblical theme that recognizing one's sinfulness is essential for seeking God's forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>&#8220;and fierce anger is upon Israel.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to the divine judgment that Israel is experiencing due to their disobedience. The concept of God's anger is prevalent in the Old Testament, often depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness. The leaders' statement reflects an understanding that their current suffering is a result of divine displeasure. This aligns with the warnings given by prophets like Amos and Hosea, who spoke of God's impending judgment on Israel for their sins. The mention of fierce anger serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance to restore the relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his idolatry and unfaithfulness to God, leading to Judah's defeat by Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was under the rule of King Ahaz during this time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which defeated Judah and took many captives.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_the_lord.htm">Prophets of the LORD</a></b><br>They warned against bringing the captives to Israel, emphasizing the need for repentance and obedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraimites.htm">Ephraimites</a></b><br>The people of the northern kingdom who were involved in the conflict and addressed by the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to guilt and separation from God.
