The appointment of priests to their duties reflects adherence to the Levitical laws outlined in the Torah, particularly in the books of Exodus and Leviticus, where the roles and responsibilities of the priests are detailed. Josiah's actions are reminiscent of the reforms of earlier kings like Hezekiah, who also sought to restore temple worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4-5</a>). This appointment underscores the importance of the priesthood in maintaining the spiritual health of the nation and ensuring that worship was conducted according to God's commandments.<p><b>and encouraged them</b><br>Josiah's encouragement of the priests indicates his active role in spiritual leadership. This encouragement can be seen as a form of exhortation, urging the priests to fulfill their roles with diligence and faithfulness. It reflects a leader who not only commands but also inspires and supports his people. This mirrors the New Testament exhortations found in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>, where believers are encouraged to spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Josiah's encouragement would have been crucial in a time when the nation was turning back to God after periods of idolatry and neglect of the temple.<p><b>in the service of the house of the LORD</b><br>The service of the house of the LORD refers to the various duties performed in the temple, including sacrifices, offerings, and maintaining the sacred space. This service was central to the religious life of Israel, as the temple was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The phrase emphasizes the importance of worship and the proper conduct of religious rites. It also points to the temple as a type of Christ, who in the New Testament is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). Josiah's reforms and the restoration of temple service foreshadow the ultimate restoration and fulfillment found in Jesus Christ, who provides the perfect and final sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms and restored the observance of the Passover.
