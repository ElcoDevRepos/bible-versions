In the biblical context, Hezekiah was known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms in Judah (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>). Consulting with leaders and mighty men reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>, which underscores the importance of seeking advice. The "mighty men" were likely his military commanders, indicating the seriousness of the impending threat from the Assyrian army led by Sennacherib. This approach contrasts with the actions of some other kings who acted independently, often leading to poor decisions.<p><b>about stopping up the waters of the springs outside the city</b><br>The strategic move to stop the waters was a defensive measure to deprive the Assyrian army of water resources during their siege. This action is supported by archaeological findings, such as the Siloam Tunnel (also known as Hezekiah's Tunnel), which redirected water from the Gihon Spring into the city of Jerusalem. This tunnel is a testament to Hezekiah's foresight and engineering prowess. The act of stopping the springs also symbolizes cutting off the enemy's life source, a tactic seen in other biblical narratives where water plays a crucial role, such as in the Exodus story (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<p><b>and they helped him carry it out</b><br>The cooperation of Hezekiah's leaders and mighty men in executing this plan demonstrates unity and shared purpose among the people of Judah. This collective effort is reminiscent of the unity seen in Nehemiah's time when rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>, which speaks to the strength found in working together.

In a moment when Assyria looms large, he reminds Judah that strong, God-honoring leadership listens first and acts second.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God expects leaders to value counsel.<p>&#8226; Military strength (&#8220;mighty men&#8221;) is best directed by spiritual and strategic clarity.<p>&#8226; Believers today likewise benefit from godly advisers before making weighty decisions (<a href="/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About stopping up the waters of the springs outside the city</b><p>The plan is practical: deny Sennacherib&#8217;s army an easy water supply while safeguarding Jerusalem&#8217;s own resources. <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a> records the same project: &#8220;You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool&#8221;. <a href="/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a> adds that Hezekiah &#8220;made a pool and a tunnel to bring water into the city&#8221;, a feat confirmed by the famous Siloam Tunnel.<p>Why this matters:<p>&#8226; Faith prepares wisely (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).

These fountains or springs were probably those represented by <span class="accented">En Rogel</span>, on the <span class="accented">Ophel spur</span> or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance "tower," in <a href="/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>) for "stopping" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word "stop" eight times, and otherwise "shut" or "closed," or to carry a derived meaning, "hidden" or "secret." If the word "shut" or "shut off" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running <span class="accented">westward</span> from the springs and the Gihon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339).
