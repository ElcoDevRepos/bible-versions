In the context of ancient Israel, a king's contribution from his own resources signifies a deep personal investment in the spiritual life of the nation. This act of giving from personal wealth reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and generosity, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_chronicles/29-3.htm">1 Chronicles 29:3</a>, where King David also gave from his own treasures for the temple.<p><b>for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings</b><br>The regular morning and evening burnt offerings were a central part of Israelite worship, as prescribed in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>. These offerings symbolized the continual dedication of the people to God and served as a daily reminder of their covenant relationship. The king's provision for these offerings underscores the importance of maintaining regular worship practices and the role of leadership in facilitating communal worship.<p><b>and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts</b><br>These offerings were part of the broader sacrificial system outlined in the Torah, specifically in <a href="/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28-29</a>. The Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts were significant times of worship and remembrance for the Israelites, marking sacred time and God's provision. The king's support for these offerings indicates a commitment to uphold the religious calendar and ensure that the nation observed these holy days, which were integral to Israel's identity and spiritual life.<p><b>as written in the Law of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes adherence to the Mosaic Law, which was the foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God. The Law of the LORD, or Torah, provided detailed instructions for worship and offerings, as seen in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The king's actions demonstrate a return to covenant faithfulness and a desire to align the nation's practices with divine commandments. This adherence to the Law is a recurring theme in the history of Israel, often associated with periods of reform and revival, such as those led by Hezekiah and later by Josiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore proper worship of Yahweh, including the re-establishment of temple services and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship where the temple was located, and where these offerings were to be made.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication, performed daily and on special occasions as prescribed in the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbaths,_new_moons,_and_appointed_feasts.htm">Sabbaths, New Moons, and Appointed Feasts</a></b><br>Specific times set by God for worship and offerings, highlighting the rhythm of worship in the life of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_the_lord.htm">The Law of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain the commandments and instructions for worship given to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_worship.htm">Commitment to Worship</a></b><br>Hezekiah's dedication to restoring proper worship highlights the importance of prioritizing our relationship with God.
