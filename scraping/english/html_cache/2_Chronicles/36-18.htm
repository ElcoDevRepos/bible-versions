The Babylonians, led by Nebuchadnezzar, besieged Jerusalem and eventually captured it, fulfilling the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets who warned of Judah's impending judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience. Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was the center of a powerful empire that dominated the ancient Near East during this period.<p><b>all the articles of the house of God, both large and small</b><br>The "articles of the house of God" refer to the sacred items used in the temple worship in Jerusalem. These included the altar, lampstands, and various utensils used in sacrifices and offerings. The removal of these items symbolized the desecration and destruction of the temple, which was the center of Jewish worship and identity. This act fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah about the consequences of the nation's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and the treasures of the house of the LORD</b><br>The treasures of the house of the LORD included gold, silver, and other valuable items dedicated to God. These treasures were often accumulated over generations and were considered sacred. Their removal signified not only a physical loss but also a spiritual one, as it represented the departure of God's favor and presence from the temple, a theme echoed in Ezekiel's visions of God's glory departing from the temple.<p><b>and of the king and his officials</b><br>The treasures of the king and his officials included personal wealth and state treasures. The confiscation of these items indicated the complete subjugation of Judah's political and religious leadership. This event marked the end of the Davidic monarchy's rule in Jerusalem until the return from exile, highlighting the fulfillment of God's judgment as prophesied in <a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17-18</a> and <a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>.

God had repeatedly warned Judah through prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8&#8211;11</a>) that unrepentant idolatry would result in exile. The Babylonian army acted as God&#8217;s instrument of judgment, physically removing Judah from the land promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Their conquest fulfilled earlier prophecies (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>) and set the stage for the seventy-year captivity foretold in <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the articles of the house of God</b><p>The phrase underscores the thoroughness of the plunder. These &#8220;articles&#8221; were the sacred vessels crafted for worship&#8212;lampstands, tables, censers&#8212;first designed in <a href="/bsb/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25&#8211;30</a> and later placed in Solomon&#8217;s temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48&#8211;51</a>). By seizing them, the Babylonians demonstrated total dominance over Judah&#8217;s worship life. <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a> records that these same items were placed in &#8220;the treasury of his god,&#8221; showing a pagan claim of victory over Israel&#8217;s God. Yet God&#8217;s sovereignty remained intact; He allowed the vessels to be taken, and He later stirred Cyrus to return them (<a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both large and small</b><p>Nothing escaped capture&#8212;every item, whether prominent like the golden altar or minor like utensils, went to Babylon. This fulfills <a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>, where earlier waves of exile had already stripped some valuables. The phrase stresses completeness: the judgment touched every level of temple service, from the most glorious furnishings to the smallest tools. Such detail underlines that sin&#8217;s consequences permeate every facet of life (<a href="/lamentations/1-10.htm">Lamentations 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king and his officials</b><p>The Babylonians seized not only temple vessels but also royal and governmental wealth (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6</a>). Temple storehouses, royal treasuries, and the riches of high officials were swept away together. This shows that both spiritual and political leaders had failed; their collective unfaithfulness led to collective loss (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14&#8211;16</a>). Moreover, the looting of royal treasures echoed earlier judgments on Hezekiah&#8217;s pride (<a href="/2_kings/20-17.htm">2 Kings 20:17</a>), demonstrating how past compromises bore bitter fruit in later generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a> records a literal, comprehensive removal of Judah&#8217;s sacred and secular wealth to Babylon. Every vessel, from great to small, every treasure, whether temple or royal, was carried off by Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s army, fulfilling prophetic warnings and manifesting God&#8217;s righteous judgment on persistent rebellion. Yet even in this severe discipline, God preserved His purposes, later returning the vessels through Cyrus and ultimately restoring His people, proving His faithfulness even when His people were faithless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">All the vessels . . .</span> (the) <span class= "bld">great and</span> (the) <span class= "bld">small.</span>--See <a href="/context/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13-17</a>, for an inventory of the articles;
