The Ark, a sacred chest made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold, was originally built during the time of Moses (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). It symbolized God's presence among His people and was previously housed in the Tabernacle. The placement of the Ark in the Temple signifies the culmination of Israel's journey from a nomadic existence to a settled nation with a permanent place of worship. This act also fulfills David's desire to build a house for the Lord, which Solomon, his son, completed (<a href="/1_kings/8-20.htm">1 Kings 8:20-21</a>).<p><b>which contains the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The Ark contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, which are the core of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>). This covenant established Israel as God's chosen people, with specific laws and commandments to follow. The presence of the covenant within the Ark underscores the centrality of God's law in the life of Israel and serves as a constant reminder of their relationship with God. The Ark's contents also included Aaron's rod that budded and a pot of manna, symbolizing God's provision and leadership (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<p><b>that He made with the children of Israel.</b><br>This covenant was made at Mount Sinai after the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 19-24). It was a conditional covenant, requiring Israel's obedience to God's laws in exchange for His blessings and protection. The phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of the covenant, highlighting that it was made with the entire nation of Israel, not just individuals. This covenant is foundational to the identity of Israel as a people set apart for God's purposes. It also foreshadows the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, which offers a relationship with God based on grace and faith rather than adherence to the law (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is speaking in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place constructed by Solomon as a permanent dwelling for the Ark and a place for worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who made a covenant with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The chosen nation with whom God made His covenant, represented by the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_the_ark.htm">The Significance of the Ark</a></b><br>The Ark symbolizes God's presence and His covenant with Israel.
