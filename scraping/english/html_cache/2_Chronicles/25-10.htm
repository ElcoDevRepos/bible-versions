This decision was contrary to God's will, as the northern kingdom of Israel was often in rebellion against God. The prophet's warning to Amaziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-7.htm">2 Chronicles 25:7-9</a>) led him to dismiss these troops. This act of obedience highlights the importance of trusting in God's provision rather than relying on human strength or alliances. Ephraim, being a leading tribe in the northern kingdom, often had strained relations with Judah, making this dismissal a politically sensitive decision.<p><b>and sent them home</b><br>Amaziah's decision to send the Ephraimite troops back home was a demonstration of his willingness to heed prophetic counsel, even at the cost of losing a significant military advantage. This action underscores the biblical principle of obedience to God over reliance on human resources. The dismissal also reflects the ongoing division between the northern and southern kingdoms, a division that had both political and spiritual implications. The return of these troops without engaging in battle would have been seen as a loss of potential plunder and honor, further fueling their discontent.<p><b>And they were furious with Judah</b><br>The anger of the Ephraimite troops can be understood in the context of lost wages and the opportunity for spoils of war. In ancient times, soldiers often relied on the plunder from military campaigns as a significant source of income. Their fury also reflects the deep-seated animosity and rivalry between the northern and southern kingdoms. This incident foreshadows the ongoing hostilities and conflicts that would continue to plague the relationship between Israel and Judah.<p><b>and returned home in great anger</b><br>The great anger of the Ephraimite troops upon their return highlights the potential for internal conflict and unrest within the region. This anger was not just a personal affront but also a reflection of the broader political tensions between the divided kingdoms. The narrative sets the stage for future conflicts, as the dismissed troops later raided towns in Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-13.htm">2 Chronicles 25:13</a>), demonstrating the consequences of unresolved anger and the fragile nature of peace between the two kingdoms.

who had come to him from Ephraim</b><p>- King Amaziah of Judah had just been warned by &#8220;a man of God&#8221; that if he marched with these hired Israelite soldiers, &#8220;God will overthrow you&#8221; (2 Chron 25:7&#8211;8).<p>- He chooses obedience over military logic, trusting the Lord rather than numerical strength&#8212;echoing truths seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> and <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>.<p>- The decision cost him 100 talents of silver (25:6, 9), yet Amaziah accepted the loss, living out <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> in real time: &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sent them home</b><p>- Dismissing the troops wasn&#8217;t merely a suggestion; it was immediate action. Obedience is often time-sensitive (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>- By sending them away before the campaign against Edom, Amaziah made it clear that victory would be God&#8217;s doing alone (2 Chron 32:8).<p>- His act also separated Judah from Israel&#8217;s apostasy (2 Chron 25:2; <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>); holiness sometimes requires hard separations (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they were furious with Judah</b><p>- The Ephraimite mercenaries felt cheated&#8212;no plunder, no glory, no chance to prove themselves. Human anger flared where selfish motives were blocked (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- Their fury previewed the tension that still simmered between north and south after the divided kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>).<p>- Amaziah&#8217;s obedience stirred opposition; faithful choices often provoke earthly backlash (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and returned home in great anger</b><p>- Their rage didn&#8217;t stay bottled up. Verse 13 records that on the way home they raided Judah&#8217;s towns, killing 3,000 and seizing spoil&#8212;a tragic consequence allowed by God yet prompted by Amaziah&#8217;s righteous choice.<p>- The episode parallels <a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5&#8211;8</a>, where Pharaoh&#8217;s resentment followed Israel&#8217;s release; deliverance for God&#8217;s people frequently agitates those outside His plan.<p>- Still, God later gave Amaziah victory over Edom without the Ephraimite troops (2 Chron 25:11), proving His warning true and vindicating obedience (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Amaziah&#8217;s dismissal of the Ephraimite soldiers shows that trusting God&#8217;s word may demand costly, unpopular decisions. Obedience severed an unholy alliance, safeguarded Judah&#8217;s campaign, and highlighted that success comes from the Lord alone. The mercenaries&#8217; anger illustrates how self-interest reacts when thwarted, yet even their wrath fit within God&#8217;s larger purposes. <a href="/2_chronicles/25-10.htm">2 Chronicles 25:10</a> therefore calls believers to courageous obedience, confident that God&#8217;s will, not human strength or approval, secures the victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">To wit, the army.</span>--<span class= "ital">The troop</span> (<span class= "ital">le</span> prefixed, as sign of the accusative).<p><span class= "bld">To go home again.</span>--To <span class= "ital">go to their own place.</span><p><span class= "bld">Home in great anger.</span>--To <span class= "ital">their own place in a heat of anger</span> (<a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm" title="And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.">Isaiah 7:4</a>). Obviously the dismissed force would be incensed at treatment which seemed to indicate distrust of their honour, and robbed them of the possible fruits of victory. On their way home they revenged themselves by plundering and slaughtering in the cities of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-13.htm" title="But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.">2Chronicles 25:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - It appears that, though this contingent from Israel's land was a hired force, yet for some reason their heart was in their calling, perhaps in anticipation of plunder. It may well be that they asked why they were discharged; and whether the right answer were given them, that the Lord dwelt not among them, or some wrong answer, it evidently did not improve matters, but rankled in their hearts till it found relief (vers. 13, 22), as they concluded that either their ability or fidelity, or both, were called in question. The 'Speaker's Commentary' very aptly cites the keen resentment and mortification that the Athenians are recorded to have felt in similar circumstances as told in Plutarch's 'Lives:' "Cimon," &sect;17. <span class="cmt_word">Separated them.</span> This is the verb occurring several times in the first verses of <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>.
