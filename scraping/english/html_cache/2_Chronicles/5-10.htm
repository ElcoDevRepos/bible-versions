These tablets, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, represented God's covenant with Israel. The absence of other items, such as Aaron's rod or the jar of manna, emphasizes the primacy of the Law in the covenant relationship. This focus on the tablets underscores the importance of God's commandments as the foundation of Israel's identity and religious life.<p><b>that Moses had placed in it at Horeb</b><br>Horeb, another name for Mount Sinai, is where Moses received the Law from God. This location is significant as it marks the place of divine revelation and covenant establishment. Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, placed the tablets in the Ark, signifying the direct link between God's commands and His chosen leader. This act at Horeb is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing the transition from slavery in Egypt to becoming a nation under God's law.<p><b>where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites</b><br>The covenant at Horeb was a binding agreement between God and the Israelites, establishing them as His people. This covenant was conditional, requiring obedience to God's laws in exchange for His protection and blessing. The presence of the tablets in the Ark served as a constant reminder of this covenantal relationship. The covenant at Horeb is foundational, setting the stage for Israel's national identity and their unique relationship with God.<p><b>after they had come out of Egypt</b><br>The exodus from Egypt is a defining event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. It marks the transition from bondage to freedom, and from being a people without a land to a nation under God's rule. The covenant made after this deliverance highlights God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This historical context underscores the significance of the covenant and the Law as guiding principles for a redeemed people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest built by the Israelites under the guidance of Moses, which held the two stone tablets of the Law.
