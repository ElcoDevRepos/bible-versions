Solomon's wisdom and God's blessing led to unprecedented economic growth. The abundance of silver and gold signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to bless Israel if they followed His commandments. This prosperity is a direct result of Solomon's request for wisdom over wealth, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10-13</a>. The comparison to stones emphasizes the extraordinary nature of this wealth, as stones were plentiful and of little value. This abundance also foreshadows the wealth of the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>, where precious materials are used as common building materials, symbolizing divine blessing and glory.<p><b>and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills</b><br>Cedar wood, particularly from Lebanon, was highly prized in the ancient Near East for its quality and durability. Solomon's use of cedar in the construction of the temple and his palace (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>) underscores its value. The abundance of cedar during Solomon's reign indicates successful trade relations, particularly with Hiram, king of Tyre, who supplied cedar in exchange for wheat and oil (<a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10-11</a>). Sycamore trees, common in the lowlands of Israel, were used for less prestigious purposes, such as building and furniture. The comparison suggests that what was once rare and valuable (cedar) became as plentiful as the more common sycamore, illustrating the extraordinary prosperity and resources available during Solomon's rule. This abundance can be seen as a type of the spiritual richness found in Christ, who provides abundantly for His people (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

He didn&#8217;t merely receive wealth; he organized, administered, and directed it (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20-21</a>; 1 Chron 29:25).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s ability flows from the Lord&#8217;s promise to David that his son would build and furnish the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>), so the abundance described here is a literal fulfillment of covenant blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem&#8217;s landscape is rocky; stones lie everywhere. By saying silver and gold were as common as those stones, Scripture draws a vivid, literal comparison of unprecedented prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/10-27.htm">1 Kings 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God had told Solomon, &#8220;I will give you riches and wealth and honor beyond all the kings of your day&#8221; (2 Chron 1:12), and here we see the tangible outworking of that promise.<p>&#8226; This wealth streamed in through trade alliances (<a href="/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22-25</a>), tribute from surrounding nations (2 Chron 9:14), and the king&#8217;s own administrative skill.<p>&#8226; The abundance fulfilled earlier promises that obedience would bring material blessing (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills</b><p>&#8226; Cedar, prized for strength and fragrance, normally came from distant Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-10</a>). Yet under Solomon it became as plentiful as the ordinary sycamore-fig trees that dotted Judah&#8217;s lowlands.<p>&#8226; This detail underscores not only material luxury but also the supply needed for temple construction (2 Chron 2:8-9) and other royal projects (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture matches the Messianic hope of future flourishing, where &#8220;the righteous will flourish like a palm tree and grow like a cedar of Lebanon&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a> gives a straightforward, literal snapshot of Solomon&#8217;s God-given prosperity.

Gesenius, in his 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voc</span>., may be consulted, and the various Bible dictionaries, especially Dr. Smith's, under "Cedar;" and Dr. Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' under "Eres." The writer in Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary' suggests that under the one word "cedar," the <span class="accented">Pinus cedrus, Pinus deodara, Yew, Taxus baccata</span>, and <span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span> (Scotch pine) were referred to popularly, and were employed when building purposes are in question. That the said variety was employed is likely enough, but that we are intended to understand this when the word "cedar" is used seems unlikely (see for further indication of this unlikeliness, the instancing of "firs" occasionally with "cedars," <a href="/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sycomore trees</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This word is found always in its present masc. plur. form except once, <a href="/psalms/78-47.htm">Psalm 78:47</a>, where the plur. fem. form is found.

Now, the former of these trees is the well. known mulberry tree. But the latter is what is called the <span class="accented">fig-mulberry</span>, or the <span class="accented">sycamore-fig</span>; and this is the tree of the Old Testament.
