The "sword" signifies warfare and invasion, common threats in the ancient Near East. "Judgment" may refer to divine retribution for sin, while "plague" and "famine" are natural disasters often seen as acts of God. These calamities were understood as both physical and spiritual challenges, testing the faith and obedience of the Israelites.<p><b>we will stand before this temple and before You,</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Standing before the temple signifies seeking God's presence and favor. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the temple serves as a physical reminder of God's promises and the people's commitment to Him. The act of standing before God indicates humility, reverence, and a plea for divine intervention.<p><b>for Your Name is in this temple.</b><br>The "Name" of God represents His character, authority, and presence. In ancient Israel, the temple was not just a building but a symbol of God's covenant and His dwelling among His people. The invocation of God's Name implies trust in His power and faithfulness. This phrase underscores the belief that God is intimately connected to the temple, making it a sacred place for seeking His help.<p><b>We will cry out to You in our distress,</b><br>Crying out to God in distress is a recurring theme in the Psalms and other biblical texts, illustrating a deep reliance on divine assistance. This act of crying out is both a personal and communal expression of faith, acknowledging human helplessness and God's sovereignty. It reflects the biblical principle that God hears the prayers of those who earnestly seek Him, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>.<p><b>and You will hear us and save us.</b><br>This statement is a declaration of faith in God's responsiveness and deliverance. It echoes the promises found in scriptures such as <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God assures His people that He will hear from heaven and heal their land if they humble themselves and pray. The assurance of being heard and saved is rooted in the covenant relationship, where God is portrayed as a faithful deliverer, foreshadowing the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who led the nation in seeking God's help during a time of crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing a coalition of enemies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The physical place in Jerusalem where God's presence dwelt, symbolizing His covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites who threatened Judah with war.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>The central theme of the passage, highlighting God's faithfulness to hear and save His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_crisis.htm">God's Presence in Crisis</a></b><br>The temple symbolizes God's presence.

Jehoshaphat&#8217;s prayer stands on the literal promise given at the temple&#8217;s dedication and models unwavering faith: acknowledge God&#8217;s sovereignty over every disaster, approach Him through the means He has provided, cry out together, and rest assured that the Lord both hears and saves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">If when evil cometh upon us.</span>--A summary of part of Solomon's Prayer of Dedication (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/6-24.htm" title="And if your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;">2Chronicles 6:24-30</a>). The reference to this prayer implies a confidence that it had been accepted in heaven, as the sign that followed it indicated (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/7-1.htm" title="Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.">2Chronicles 7:1-3</a>). Syriac, "<span class= "ital">When the sanctuary is amongst us,</span> there will not come upon us evil, nor sword, nor judgment, &c., and we will come and stand before this house, and before Thee, because Thy name is invoked in this house; and we will come and pray before Thee in this house and thou wilt hearken to the voice of our prayer, and deliver us." The Hebrew seems to say, "If there come upon us evil--sword (judgment), and pestilence and famine--we will stand (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> come forward) before this house, and before Thee, for Thy name is in this house, and we will cry unto Thee out of our distress, and Thou shalt (or <span class= "ital">that Thou mayest</span>) hear and save." The word rendered "judgment" (<span class= "ital">sh?ph?t</span>) is not used as a noun anywhere else; and, lacking a conjunction, it spoils the symmetry of the sentence. It is probably an ancient gloss. All the versions have it; and the Vulg. renders, "sword of judgment."
