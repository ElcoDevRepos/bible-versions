This reflects the practice of young kings in the ancient Near East, where royal succession often occurred at a young age due to the untimely death or deposition of a predecessor. His youth may have required him to rely heavily on advisors, including the prophet Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-5.htm">2 Chronicles 26:5</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years</b><br>Uzziah's long reign was one of the most prosperous in Judah's history, marked by military successes, economic growth, and infrastructural development. His reign is notable for its length, second only to Manasseh's in Judah. This period of stability allowed for significant advancements, including fortifications and agricultural innovations. However, his reign ended in tragedy due to his pride and subsequent leprosy (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>).<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem</b><br>Jecoliah's mention indicates her importance in Uzziah's life and possibly her influence in his early years. Being from Jerusalem, she was likely well-acquainted with the religious and cultural traditions of Judah, which may have shaped Uzziah's initial adherence to God's ways. The inclusion of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative often underscores the role of mothers in the spiritual and moral upbringing of kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzziah.htm">Uzziah</a></b><br>Also known as Azariah, Uzziah was a king of Judah who began his reign at the young age of sixteen.

Jeremiah protested, &#8220;I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth,&#8221; yet God replied, &#8220;Do not say, &#8216;I am only a youth&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-7</a>). Similarly, Paul urged Timothy, &#8220;Let no one despise your youth&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). Uzziah confirms that the living God entrusts real responsibility to teenagers and supplies the grace to carry it.<p>&#8226; Age never restrains the sovereign choice of God. David was the youngest of Jesse&#8217;s sons when Samuel anointed him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>). Josiah was only eight when he mounted Judah&#8217;s throne (2 Chron 34:1-3), and God steered an entire national reform through him.<p>&#8226; The early start magnifies the Lord&#8217;s training ground. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> reminds the young and old alike, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart&#8230; He will make your paths straight.&#8221; Uzziah&#8217;s path begins in teenage vulnerability; God&#8217;s faithfulness will shape every step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years</b><p>&#8220;He reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years&#8221; (2 Chron 26:3).<p>&#8226; Such an exceptionally long reign signals divine favor and national stability. By comparison, Asa ruled forty-one years (<a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9-10</a>) and Amaziah twenty-nine (<a href="/2_kings/14-1.htm">2 Kings 14:1-2</a>). Fifty-two years matches Manasseh&#8217;s fifty-five (<a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>), placing Uzziah among the longest-serving monarchs in Judah.<p>&#8226; Longevity heightens accountability. More years mean more opportunities either to walk faithfully, like Hezekiah (2 Chron 31:20-21), or to drift, like Solomon in later life (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-6</a>). Uzziah&#8217;s record begins well (2 Chron 26:4-5) but ends with tragic pride (26:16-21). <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a> cautions, &#8220;Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jerusalem anchors the narrative. The city where God placed His Name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>) becomes the stage on which Uzziah&#8217;s half-century story unfolds. <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a> celebrates, &#8220;God will establish her forever.&#8221; Uzziah&#8217;s reign contributes to that ongoing testimony of divine faithfulness in the capital of Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem</b><p>&#8220;His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem&#8221; (2 Chron 26:3).<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes a king&#8217;s mother, underscoring the formative power of godly parenting. Joash&#8217;s mother Zibiah of Beersheba is likewise named when he begins to reign at seven (2 Chron 24:1).<p>&#8226; A mother rooted in Jerusalem suggests exposure to temple worship and covenant truth. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a> directs parents to impress God&#8217;s words on their children; Jecoliah likely modeled that obedience.<p>&#8226; New Testament echoes arise in Lois and Eunice, whose sincere faith influenced Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). A mother&#8217;s spiritual legacy sets trajectories that span generations.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a> states, &#8220;Her children rise up and call her blessed.&#8221; Uzziah&#8217;s initial devotion (2 Chron 26:5) may well reflect the quiet, daily discipleship of Jecoliah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/26-3.htm">2 Chronicles 26:3</a> packs three brief facts that together paint a vivid portrait. God calls even the young, entrusts them with significant roles, and counts their years as stewardship. A lengthy reign in Jerusalem illustrates both divine blessing and the sobering responsibility that comes with time. Behind it all stands a mother, Jecoliah, whose influence reminds us that family faithfulness is never wasted. The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s timing, pursue steadfast obedience across the long haul, and invest in the next generation so they, too, may rise up and serve the Lord wholeheartedly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jecoliah</span>.
