This acknowledgment reflects the influence and reputation of Israel's God among neighboring nations. It also shows a level of respect and reverence for the God who had blessed Israel with prosperity and wisdom.<p><b>who made the heavens and the earth!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the LORD's role as the Creator, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.
