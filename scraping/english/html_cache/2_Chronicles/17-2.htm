Fortified cities were crucial for defense against invasions, and Judah had several such cities, including Jerusalem, Lachish, and Hebron. This action reflects a common practice in ancient Near Eastern kingdoms to ensure protection and maintain control over their territories. The fortified cities served as military strongholds and administrative centers, highlighting the importance of preparedness and vigilance in leadership.<p><b>and put garrisons in the land of Judah</b><br>Garrisons were military posts established to maintain order and provide rapid response to threats. By placing garrisons throughout Judah, Jehoshaphat ensured a constant military presence, which would deter potential aggressors and maintain internal stability. This move also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where leaders are called to protect and manage the resources and people entrusted to them.<p><b>and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured</b><br>The cities of Ephraim mentioned here were territories that had been previously captured by Asa, Jehoshaphat's father, during his reign. This indicates a continuation of Asa's military successes and the consolidation of Judah's influence over parts of the northern kingdom of Israel. The reference to Ephraim, a significant tribe in Israel, underscores the historical tension and occasional conflict between the northern and southern kingdoms. Jehoshaphat's actions demonstrate a commitment to maintaining and expanding the territorial gains achieved by his father, reflecting the biblical theme of generational legacy and the importance of building upon the foundations laid by predecessors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who succeeded his father Asa.
