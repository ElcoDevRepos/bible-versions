This brief period suggests a time of instability and transition following the division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. Jerusalem, the capital city, remained the political and spiritual center of Judah, housing the Temple built by Solomon. The short reign may reflect the challenges Abijah faced, including internal strife and external threats, particularly from the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; she was from Gibeah.</b><br>Micaiah, also known as Maacah in some biblical texts, was the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Gibeah was a city in the territory of Benjamin, which holds historical significance as the site of several key events in Israel's history, including the infamous incident in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. The mention of Micaiah's lineage highlights the importance of maternal ancestry in royal lineages, which could influence political alliances and legitimacy. Uriel's connection to Gibeah may indicate a strategic alliance between Judah and Benjamin, two tribes with shared heritage and interests.<p><b>And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</b><br>The conflict between Abijah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam, king of Israel, was part of the ongoing hostilities following the division of the united monarchy. Jeroboam, who led the northern tribes in rebellion against Solomon's son Rehoboam, established a separate kingdom with its own religious practices, often in opposition to the worship centered in Jerusalem. This war reflects the broader theme of division and conflict within the people of Israel, a consequence of their departure from covenantal faithfulness. The struggle between Abijah and Jeroboam also underscores the political and religious tensions that characterized the period of the divided kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned in Jerusalem for three years.

This is confirmed by the LXX., Syriac, and Arabic, which read Maachah. As we have already stated (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm" title="And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.">2Chronicles 11:20</a>), Maachah was <span class= "ital">granddaughter</span> to Absalom, being a daughter of Tamar the only daughter of Absalom. Uriel of Gibeah, then, must have been the husband of Tamar. (See on <a href="/2_chronicles/15-16.htm" title="And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.">2Chronicles 15:16</a>.

"Now war had prevailed [same verb] between Abijam [common Hebrew text incorrectly has <span class= "ital">Rehoboam]</span> and Jeroboam <span class= "ital">all the days of his life."</span> The chronicler modifies the sense by omitting the concluding phrase, and then proceeds to give a striking account of a campaign in which Abijah totally defeated his rival (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/13-3.htm" title="And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 13:3-20</a>); of all which we find not a word in Kings. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_chronicles/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah</span>. As before noted (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), and as in the parallel (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>), this name is one with "Maachah, daughter of Absalom" (parallel, <span class="accented">Abishalom</span>). The different alphabetic characters may be attributed to error, and that error the error of transcription merely. As in our note (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), the word "daughter," as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. &sect; 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom. We have no clue as to which out of many Gibeahs is here intended. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places.
