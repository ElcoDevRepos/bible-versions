In the preceding chapter, Jehoshaphat had instituted religious reforms and judicial systems in Judah, emphasizing a return to the worship of Yahweh. The phrase suggests that the events about to unfold are a direct consequence or follow-up to these reforms, highlighting the spiritual warfare that often follows spiritual renewal.<p><b>the Moabites and Ammonites</b><br>The Moabites and Ammonites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, through his daughters (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). Historically, these nations were often in conflict with Israel and Judah. Their lands were located east of the Jordan River, with Moab to the south and Ammon to the north. These nations had a history of idolatry and opposition to the Israelites, often serving as instruments of God's judgment or as adversaries in times of Israel's disobedience.<p><b>together with some of the Meunites</b><br>The Meunites are less frequently mentioned in the Bible, but they are believed to be a group of people from the region of Edom or Arabia. Their inclusion in this coalition against Judah suggests a broader alliance of enemies, emphasizing the severity of the threat against Jehoshaphat. This coalition reflects the common practice in the ancient Near East of forming alliances to strengthen military campaigns.<p><b>came to make war against Jehoshaphat</b><br>Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to rid the land of idolatry. The attack against him can be seen as a spiritual assault against a leader who was striving to lead his people in righteousness. This phrase sets the stage for the subsequent narrative, where Jehoshaphat's response to the threat becomes a model of faith and reliance on God. The impending war serves as a backdrop for demonstrating God's power and faithfulness to those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.

The coalition of Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites illustrates how longstanding enemies can unite against God&#8217;s people, yet the coming narrative (vv. 15&#8211;30) will demonstrate that the LORD, not human strength, decides the outcome of every battle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_chronicles/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">It came to pass after this also.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And it came to pass afterwards, i.e.,</span> after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and Jehoshaphat's reformation of law and religion.<p><span class= "bld">And the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites.</span>--This is an attempt to get a reasonable sense out of a corrupted text.
