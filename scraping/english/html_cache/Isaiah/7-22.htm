In the context of Isaiah, this abundance is paradoxical, as it comes during a time of judgment and desolation. The land, though ravaged, will still support enough livestock to provide milk. This reflects God's provision even in times of hardship. The abundance of milk can also symbolize spiritual nourishment and sustenance provided by God.<p><b>he will eat curds</b><br>Curds, a byproduct of milk, were a common food in ancient Israel, indicating a simple, pastoral lifestyle. Eating curds signifies a return to basic sustenance, contrasting with the luxury and excess that may have characterized the society before judgment. This simplicity can be seen as a form of purification or a return to reliance on God's provision. The mention of curds also connects to the idea of the Promised Land, "a land flowing with milk and honey," indicating God's continued faithfulness.<p><b>for all who remain in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights a remnant theology, a common theme in Isaiah, where a faithful remnant of Israel will survive God's judgment. Those who remain are the ones who will experience God's provision and care. This remnant is often seen as a type of the faithful believers who endure trials and remain true to God. The concept of a remnant is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>, where Paul speaks of a remnant chosen by grace.<p><b>will eat curds and honey</b><br>Curds and honey together symbolize a diet of simplicity and sufficiency. Honey, like curds, is a natural product, often associated with abundance and blessing. The combination of curds and honey suggests a return to a more Edenic state, where God's creation provides for humanity's needs. This phrase also points to the Messianic age, where peace and prosperity will be restored. In a typological sense, it can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual nourishment found in Christ, who provides for the needs of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book and is delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Isaiah's prophecies were primarily directed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah during Isaiah's time, who was facing threats from surrounding nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire threatening Judah, which plays a significant role in the context of Isaiah's prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>Refers to those who remain faithful and survive the coming judgment and devastation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_judgment.htm">God's Provision in Times of Judgment</a></b><br>Even in times of judgment, God provides for His people.

After the Assyrian sweep, fields lie fallow and weeds replace crops, yet the land becomes fresh pasture. Even a tiny herd can produce an &#8220;abundance of milk.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God turns devastation into provision. When supplies seem wiped out, He multiplies what is left&#8212;much like He stretched the widow&#8217;s oil in <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a> or the loaves and fish in <a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27</a> pictures milk from goats sustaining a household, confirming that dairy often stands for God&#8217;s basic, dependable care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will eat curds</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;he will eat curds&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Curds are a simple, rustic food&#8212;milk thickened and preserved. After invasion, luxury items disappear; people live on what they can make quickly.<p>&#8226; Rather than a diet of royal delicacies, the survivor eats what God supplies day by day, echoing the simplicity of manna in <a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15, 31</a>.<p>&#8226; This prepares hearts for humility (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>) and points forward to Immanuel&#8217;s own childhood diet of &#8220;curds and honey&#8221; in <a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>, stressing His identification with the ordinary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all who remain&#8221; highlights the faithful remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>). Judgment removes the rebellious, but God protects a core people.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Curds and honey&#8221; recalls the covenant promise of &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>). Even in reduced circumstances, the same covenant God feeds His own.<p>&#8226; Honey comes from wild bees that thrive in uncultivated ground (<a href="/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8-9</a>). Together with dairy, it paints a picture of rural simplicity yet sweet sufficiency&#8212;God&#8217;s mercy shining through desolation (<a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a> shows God stripping away Judah&#8217;s false security yet sustaining a remnant with humble, wholesome fare. Ravaged fields become pasture; a small herd yields more than enough milk; curds and honey replace the banquet table. Judgment cleanses, but provision remains. The verse assures believers that when God disciplines, He also preserves, nourishing those who trust Him until full restoration arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the abundance of milk that they shall give</span>.

Curdled milk and wild honey should form the simple diet of the remnant left in the land.
