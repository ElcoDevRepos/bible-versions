In the context of Isaiah, it points to the Day of the Lord, a time when God will execute judgment and establish His kingdom. This eschatological theme is prevalent throughout the prophetic books, emphasizing a future period of reckoning and restoration.<p><b>men will cast away</b><br>The act of casting away signifies a complete rejection and renunciation. This imagery suggests a dramatic change in values and priorities, where people will abandon what they once held dear. It reflects a moment of realization and repentance, where the futility of idolatry becomes apparent.<p><b>to the moles and bats</b><br>Moles and bats are creatures associated with darkness and uncleanliness in biblical times. The choice of these animals underscores the worthlessness and impurity of the idols. It suggests that the idols, once revered, will be discarded into places of obscurity and insignificance, highlighting their ultimate powerlessness.<p><b>their idols of silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold were materials commonly used in the creation of idols, signifying wealth and human craftsmanship. The mention of these precious metals emphasizes the misplaced trust in material wealth and human-made objects. This critique of idolatry is a recurring theme in the Bible, where reliance on physical objects is contrasted with faith in the living God.<p><b>the idols they made to worship</b><br>This phrase highlights the human origin of the idols, underscoring their inadequacy as objects of worship. It reflects the biblical condemnation of idolatry, where the creation is wrongly elevated above the Creator.

God promises a literal future moment when His majesty breaks in so powerfully that every rival god is exposed as worthless. Just as Noah&#8217;s flood arrived exactly when God said (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-13</a>) and Christ&#8217;s resurrection occurred &#8220;on the third day&#8221; exactly as foretold (<a href="/luke/24-6.htm">Luke 24:6-7</a>), this day will also arrive right on schedule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Men will cast away</b><p>People who once clung to idols will suddenly hurl them aside. Isaiah repeats the picture later: &#8220;In that day each of you will reject the silver and gold idols your sinful hands have made&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-7.htm">Isaiah 31:7</a>). The reaction is instinctive&#8212;like sailors dumping cargo in a storm (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>) or Ephesians burning their magic scrolls when the gospel took hold (<a href="/acts/19-18.htm">Acts 19:18-19</a>). When God&#8217;s glory confronts the human heart, clinging to substitutes becomes unthinkable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the moles and bats</b><p>Moles burrow underground; bats hide in caverns. Both live where light is scarce, places men would not normally store treasure. The point is vivid: idols will be tossed into the deepest, darkest holes&#8212;out of sight, out of mind. This echoes Jesus&#8217; warning that evildoers &#8220;love darkness rather than light&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>) and Revelation&#8217;s picture of kings and generals begging rocks to hide them from the face of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).

Silver and gold dazzled ancient eyes just as wealth does today.

Worship belongs to the One who formed heaven and earth, not to objects we produce. The verse highlights personal responsibility: &#8220;they made.&#8221; Every human heart either bows to the living God or crafts substitutes. When the Lord reveals Himself, the pretense collapses, and &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee will bow&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a> paints a literal future scene where people, stunned by God&#8217;s unveiled glory, frantically ditch their costliest idols in the darkest holes. The verse drives home four truths: God&#8217;s appointed day is certain; human pride will give way to repentance or ruin; earthly wealth cannot save; and self-made gods are doomed to disgrace. Wise hearts respond now&#8212;casting away every rival and embracing the Lord alone, for He will be exalted and His Word stands forever (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">A man shall cast his idols of silver </span>. . .--The picture of the earthquake is still continued. The men who have taken refuge in the caves fling away the idols, that they have found powerless to help them, to the moles and bats which had their dwelling there. It is perhaps significant that the animals thus named were proverbial for their blindness and love of darkness.

A passage of Habakkuk (<a href="/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>) shows that sometimes the main bulk of the idol was of stone, which was overlaid with a coating of one or other of the two precious metals; but it would seem that ordinarily the entire image was either of gold or silver (comp. <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4, 24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>).
