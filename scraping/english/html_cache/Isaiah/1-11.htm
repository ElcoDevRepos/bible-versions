In the historical context, sacrifices were central to Israelite worship as prescribed in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 1-7). However, God is emphasizing that the mere act of sacrifice, without genuine repentance and obedience, is meaningless. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice. The rhetorical question underscores the futility of external religious practices when the heart is far from God.<p><b>&#8220;I am full from the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle;&#8221;</b><br>Burnt offerings were a common form of sacrifice intended to atone for sin and express devotion (Leviticus 1). The mention of "rams" and "well-fed cattle" indicates the quality and abundance of the offerings, which were supposed to be the best of the flock. However, God's statement of being "full" suggests that He is overwhelmed and displeased with the insincerity behind these offerings. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires mercy and knowledge of Him rather than mere ritual (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I take no delight in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.&#8221;</b><br>The blood of these animals was significant in the sacrificial system for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Yet, God declares no pleasure in these sacrifices when they are devoid of true worship and repentance. This anticipates the New Testament revelation that the blood of animals cannot ultimately take away sins (<a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a>). It points to the need for a perfect sacrifice, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose blood provides true atonement (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).

"Thinkest thou that I will eat the flesh of bulls, and drink the blood of goats? "(Psalm 1:13). God "delights not in burnt offerings." From the time of Samuel he had declared, "Behold, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David had said of him, "Sacrifice and meat offering thou wouldest not; burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required" (<a href="/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8, 9</a>); and again, "I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, because they were not always before me.

Not, of course, that either David or Isaiah desired to abolish sacrifice, or had any commission so to do; but they were, both of them, anxious to impress on men that sacrifice, <span class="accented">by itself</span>, was nothing - that self-dedication, self-renunciation, true devotion of the heart, with its necessary concomitant obedience, must accompany sacrifice, for God to be pleased therewith.

It is explained to be emphatic, implying that this is what God says, and will say, concerning the matter in hand, once and forever (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">I am full of the burnt offerings of rams</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I am overfull</span>, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, <span class="accented">wearied with them</span>. Barns formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (<a href="/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>), at the Feast of Weeks (<a href="/numbers/28-27.htm">Numbers 28:27</a>), at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36</a>), at the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2</a>), and on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="/numbers/29-8.htm">Numbers 29:8</a>). They were commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (<a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16, 18</a>). Under David were offered on one occasion "a thousand rams" (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-21.htm">1 Chronicles 29:21</a>); and the occasions where seven rams formed the legitimate sacrifice were many. Unaccompanied by a proper frame of mind, each such offering was an offence to God, displeased him, wearied him. <span class="cmt_word">The fat of fed beasts.</span> The fat was always regarded, both by the Hebrews and the Greeks, as especially suitable for sacrifice. It was burnt upon the altar in every case, even where the greater part of the victim was consumed as food (see <a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8, 12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3, 10</a>, etc.; note particularly the expression in <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>, "All the fat is the Lord's"). "Fed beasts" are those which were kept separate in stalls or sheds for some time before the sacrifice, and given food in which there was nothing" unclean." The Paschal lambs were required to be thus separated and fed for four days (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I delight not in the blood.</span> The blood, "which is the life" (<a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>), was to be sprinkled on the altar in every sacrifice of a victim. This sprinkling was of the very essence of the sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6, 17, 25, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Bullocks... lambs... he-goats.</span> These, together with rams, constituted all the sacrificial beasts of the Hebrews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your multitude</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7230.htm">Strong's 7230: </a> </span><span class="str2">Multitude, abundance, greatness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of sacrifices</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(zi&#7687;&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
