"Jacob" refers to the patriarch whose name was changed to Israel, symbolizing the entire nation. The call to "remember" is significant in the Hebrew tradition, emphasizing the importance of recalling God's faithfulness and covenant. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where remembrance is tied to obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p><b>for you are My servant, O Israel</b><br>The term "servant" denotes a special relationship between God and Israel, highlighting their role in God's redemptive plan. Israel is chosen to serve God and be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This servant motif is later fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Servant of the Lord (Isaiah 53).<p><b>I have made you</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and creative power. It reminds Israel of their origin and purpose, crafted by God Himself. This echoes the creation narrative where God forms humanity (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), and it reinforces the idea that Israel's identity and mission are divinely ordained.<p><b>and you are My servant</b><br>Reiterating Israel's role as God's servant emphasizes their duty to live according to His will. This role involves both privilege and responsibility, as they are to embody God's laws and character. The servant theme is central to Isaiah's prophecies, pointing to the coming Messiah who perfectly fulfills this role (<a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>).<p><b>O Israel, I will never forget you</b><br>This assurance of God's unfailing memory and commitment to Israel is a profound promise of His enduring faithfulness. Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains steadfast. This promise is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are assured of God's constant presence and love (<a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). The phrase also anticipates the new covenant, where God&#8217;s people are eternally remembered and redeemed through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the patriarch Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel.

By recalling God&#8217;s past faithfulness, Israel can resist present temptations and fears (<a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you are My servant, O Israel</b><p>&#8226; Identity follows memory.

Jesus later said, &#8220;I no longer call you servants &#8230; but friends&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>), showing the ultimate dignity God gives His people.<p>&#8226; Knowing we belong to Him frees us from serving lesser masters (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have made you, and you are My servant</b><p>&#8226; God reminds Israel that He is Creator and therefore Owner (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>).

Israel, having been exhorted never to forget the impotency of idols (ver. 21), is promised forgiveness and deliverance (vers. 21, 22). Then, heaven and earth are called upon to join in rejoicing over the announcement (ver. 23). Finally, in a noble burst of poetry, God is represented as solemnly declaring his intention of frustrating all the false sayings of the soothsayers concerning his people, and accomplishing their restoration to their own land, and the rebuilding of their temple through the instrumentality of Cyrus (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the futility of idols and the folly of the idol-worshippers.
