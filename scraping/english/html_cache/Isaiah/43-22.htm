In biblical context, calling on God signifies prayer, worship, and reliance on Him. Jacob, representing the nation of Israel, is often used to remind the people of their patriarchal heritage and covenant relationship with God. Historically, Israel's failure to call on God often led to periods of spiritual decline and judgment, as seen in the cycles of the Judges and the eventual exile. This neglect of calling on God contrasts with the fervent prayers of their ancestors, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who actively sought God's guidance and intervention.<p><b>because you have grown weary of Me, O Israel</b><br>This phrase suggests a spiritual fatigue or disinterest in maintaining a relationship with God. The weariness could stem from a variety of factors, including the influence of surrounding pagan cultures, the burden of religious rituals without heartfelt devotion, or disappointment in unmet expectations of deliverance. Culturally, Israel was surrounded by nations with different deities and practices, which often led to syncretism and a dilution of their faith. This weariness is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God calls out Israel's superficial worship and lack of true devotion (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, <a href="/malachi/1-13.htm">Malachi 1:13</a>). Theologically, this weariness can be seen as a type of spiritual adultery, where Israel's heart is divided between God and other idols. In the New Testament, Jesus addresses similar issues of heartless worship and calls for true worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, named after the patriarch Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel.

Their insertion, however, by a later writer would be at least as hard to understand as their having come from the hand of the same writer as the glowing picture that precedes them. May we not find the solution of the problem in the fact that Isaiah's experience taught him that there would be in the future, as in the past, a dark as well as a bright side to the picture? that the mercies shown to the exiles would not be according to their merits, but to God's great goodness? The worship of the restored exiles would be as that of the people had been in his own time, meagre and unthankful. Visions of failure alternate with the glowing hope that the ideal will be realised, and this alternation constitutes the great problem of the book, as it does of all like apocalyptic intimations.<p><span class= "bld">But thou hast been weary.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">so that thou shouldest be weary. </span>Others render it, <span class= "ital">Much less hast thou toiled for me. </span>Sacrifices elsewhere than in the Temple were forbidden by the Law, and the prophet does not so much blame the people for not offering these as for not compensating for their absence by the true worship of which they were the symbols.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-28.</span> - A REPROACH ADDRESSED TO CAPTIVE ISRAEL FOR ITS PAST OMISSIONS AND SINS. The thought of Israel in the future, redeemed, restored, and "telling out God's praise" (ver. 21), raises naturally the con-trusted thought of Israel in the present and the past, disobedient, full of shortcomings (vers. 22-24), too often guilty of overt acts of sin (vers. 24-28). While reproaching his people, and reminding them that the exile is the wellmented punishment of their past offences (vers. 27, 28), God still promises them pardon if they will appeal to his covenant of mercy (vers. 25, 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast not called upon me</span>. The Jews had never been greatly given to prayer. They were a "practical" people, active, energetic, hard-working, busily employed in handicrafts, commerce, or agriculture. David and Daniel, who prayed three times a day (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), were probably exceptions to the general rule. At any rate, it appears here that in the exile the nation had neglected prayer. No doubt there was a nucleus of "faithful men," who did as Daniel did. But with the mass it was otherwise. Hard toil occupied their time. Despair made dull their hearts. They looked for no alleviation of their lot, and lived on in a sort of apathy. <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast been weary of me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for thou hast wearied of me.</span> Thou hast left off praying, because thou wast weary of my service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/43-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But you have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
