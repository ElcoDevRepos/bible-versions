In the context of Isaiah, it points to a specific period when God's judgment will be executed. It is a common prophetic term used throughout the Old Testament to denote a significant event orchestrated by God.<p><b>their strong cities</b><br>The "strong cities" refer to fortified cities that were considered secure and impenetrable. In ancient times, cities with strong walls and defenses were seen as symbols of power and safety. The mention of these cities highlights the extent of the coming judgment, as even the most secure places will not withstand it.<p><b>will be like forsaken thickets and summits</b><br>This imagery suggests desolation and abandonment. Thickets and summits, once vibrant and full of life, become overgrown and deserted. The comparison indicates that the once-bustling cities will be left in ruin, overtaken by nature, and devoid of human presence.<p><b>abandoned to the Israelites</b><br>This phrase implies a reversal of fortunes. Historically, the Israelites were often oppressed by surrounding nations. Here, the cities are abandoned to them, suggesting a shift in power. It reflects God's promise to restore and vindicate His people, as seen in other prophetic texts where Israel's enemies are defeated.<p><b>and to utter desolation</b><br>The term "utter desolation" emphasizes the complete and total destruction that will occur. It signifies not just physical ruin but also the end of any former glory or significance. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of divine judgment against nations that oppose God's will, as seen in the destruction of cities like Babylon and Nineveh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
