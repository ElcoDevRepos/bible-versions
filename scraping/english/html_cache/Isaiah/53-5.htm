The term "pierced" prophetically points to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). The word "transgressions" refers to deliberate sins or violations of God's law, emphasizing humanity's need for redemption. This act of being pierced is a fulfillment of prophecy, showing the Messiah's role in bearing the sins of the world.<p><b>He was crushed for our iniquities</b><br>"Crushed" signifies intense suffering and affliction, indicating the severity of the servant's sacrifice. "Iniquities" refers to moral corruption and wickedness, underscoring the depth of human sinfulness. This phrase connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where animals were offered to atone for the people's sins (Leviticus 16). The crushing of the servant symbolizes the complete and sufficient sacrifice of Jesus, who bore the weight of humanity's sins.<p><b>The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the concept of peace, or "shalom," which encompasses wholeness, well-being, and reconciliation with God. The "punishment" indicates the justice required for sin, which the servant endures on behalf of others. This substitutionary act results in peace between God and humanity, fulfilling the promise of reconciliation found in passages like <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>. The servant's suffering is the means by which believers are restored to a right relationship with God.<p><b>And by His stripes we are healed</b><br>"Stripes" refers to the wounds inflicted by scourging, a form of punishment that Jesus endured before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>). The healing mentioned is both spiritual and physical, pointing to the comprehensive salvation offered through Christ's sacrifice. This healing is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, where the apostle Peter applies this prophecy to the redemptive work of Jesus. The phrase emphasizes the transformative power of the servant's suffering, bringing restoration and wholeness to those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This figure is central to <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and is traditionally understood by conservative Christians to be a prophetic reference to Jesus Christ.
