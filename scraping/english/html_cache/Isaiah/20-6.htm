In the context of Isaiah, it refers to the time when the prophecy against Egypt and Cush (modern-day Ethiopia) would be realized. This emphasizes the certainty of God's word coming to pass.<p><b>the dwellers of this coastland</b><br>The "coastland" refers to the regions along the Mediterranean Sea, likely including Philistia and other nearby territories. These areas were often caught between the major powers of Egypt and Assyria, making them vulnerable to political and military upheaval.<p><b>will say, &#8216;See what has happened to our source of hope,</b><br>Egypt and Cush were seen as powerful allies capable of providing military support against Assyrian aggression. The phrase highlights the misplaced trust in human power rather than in God. This serves as a warning against relying on worldly alliances instead of divine protection.<p><b>those to whom we fled for help and deliverance</b><br>Historically, smaller nations often sought refuge and assistance from larger, more powerful neighbors. This reflects the political dynamics of the ancient Near East, where vassal states would seek protection from dominant empires. The failure of Egypt and Cush to provide deliverance underscores the futility of trusting in human strength.<p><b>from the king of Assyria!</b><br>The Assyrian Empire was a dominant force during Isaiah's time, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies. The mention of the Assyrian king underscores the immediate threat faced by the nations and the fear he instilled. This context highlights the geopolitical tension and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>How then can we escape?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question captures the despair and helplessness of the people when their expected deliverers fail. It serves as a call to recognize the sovereignty of God and the need to place trust in Him alone.
