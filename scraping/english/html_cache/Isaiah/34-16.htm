In the context of Isaiah, the "scroll of the LORD" refers to the prophetic writings that contain God's decrees and promises. The act of searching and reading implies diligent study and reflection, highlighting the value placed on understanding God's word. This mirrors the practice of the Bereans in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, who examined the Scriptures daily to verify the teachings they received.<p><b>Not one of these will go missing:</b><br>This assurance speaks to the certainty and reliability of God's promises. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, it refers to the prophetic declarations concerning judgment and the desolation of Edom. The phrase underscores the idea that God's word is infallible and that every prophecy will be fulfilled precisely as spoken. This aligns with Jesus' affirmation in <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> that not the smallest letter or stroke will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.<p><b>Not one will lack her mate:</b><br>This imagery suggests completeness and fulfillment. In the context of the prophecy, it may refer to the pairing of animals in the desolate land, symbolizing the thoroughness of God's judgment. Theologically, it can also be seen as a metaphor for the fulfillment of God's plans, where every prophecy and promise finds its counterpart or completion. This reflects the biblical theme of God's perfect orchestration of events, as seen in the pairing of prophecies with their fulfillment in Christ.<p><b>Because He has ordered it by His mouth:</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine authority and power behind the prophetic word. God's spoken word is creative and effectual, as seen in the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the universe into existence. The emphasis on God's mouth signifies that these events are not random but are decreed by the sovereign will of God. This underscores the belief in the inerrancy and authority of Scripture, as God's word is seen as the ultimate truth.<p><b>And He will gather them by His Spirit:</b><br>The gathering by His Spirit indicates the active role of the Holy Spirit in bringing about God's purposes. In the context of Isaiah, it may refer to the gathering of nations for judgment or the restoration of God's people. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the Spirit's work in executing God's plans, as seen in the gathering of believers into the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>). The Spirit's involvement underscores the unity and coherence of God's redemptive work throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll_of_the_lord.htm">The Scroll of the LORD</a></b><br>Represents the written word of God, containing His decrees and promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_lord.htm">The Spirit of the LORD</a></b><br>The active presence of God, ensuring the fulfillment of His word.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, the nations are those under judgment, highlighting God's sovereignty over all peoples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>Specifically mentioned earlier in the chapter as a symbol of God's judgment against nations opposed to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_scripture.htm">The Authority of Scripture</a></b><br>The "scroll of the LORD" signifies the ultimate authority of God's word.

Isaiah applies that title either to this particular section, or to the volume of his collected writings.

By "the book of the Lord" some understand a collected volume of Moses and the prophets, psalmists, etc., previous to Isaiah's time, which they suppose to have existed in his day. But there is no evidence of any such collection. It is better to understand the expression of Isaiah's own prophecies, or of such a collection of them as he had made previously to the composition of the present chapter. Nothing contained in the entire book should, he says, fail of its accomplishment. Even the minutiae of the present chapter should, each and all, have their fulfillment, though not, perhaps, in every case a literal one. <span class="cmt_word">My mouth... his Spirit</span>.
