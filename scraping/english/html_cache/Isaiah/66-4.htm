In the context of Isaiah, God is addressing the rebellious nature of the people of Israel. The concept of God choosing punishment is consistent with the covenant relationship where blessings and curses are outlined (Deuteronomy 28). The punishment is not arbitrary but a response to the people's actions, reflecting the principle of retributive justice found throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and I will bring terror upon them</b><br>The use of "terror" suggests a severe and fear-inducing consequence. Historically, this could refer to the invasions and exiles experienced by Israel, such as the Babylonian captivity. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of turning away from God. This aligns with prophetic warnings found in other books, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where the consequences of disobedience are vividly described.<p><b>because I called and no one answered</b><br>This phrase highlights God's initiative in reaching out to His people, emphasizing His desire for relationship and repentance. The imagery of calling and not being answered is reminiscent of the parable of the wedding banquet in <a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, where invitations are ignored. It underscores the theme of divine patience and human responsibility.<p><b>I spoke and no one listened</b><br>This reflects the prophetic tradition where God's messages, delivered through prophets, were often ignored. The historical context includes numerous prophets sent to warn Israel, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Hosea. The failure to listen is a recurring theme, illustrating the hardness of heart that leads to judgment.<p><b>But they did evil in My sight</b><br>The phrase "in My sight" indicates that God is fully aware of the actions of His people. The concept of doing evil in God's sight is a common biblical theme, seen in the narratives of the kings of Israel and Judah, where their actions are evaluated based on their faithfulness to God. This phrase underscores the moral and ethical standards expected by God.<p><b>and chose that in which I did not delight</b><br>This highlights the element of choice and the moral agency of the people. The idea of God not delighting in certain actions is seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>, where God desires a contrite heart over sacrifices. It points to the deeper issue of the heart's orientation towards God, rather than mere external compliance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, expressing His judgment and displeasure with the people's disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, who are being warned about their disobedience and the consequences of ignoring God's call.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine communication and warning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God is just and will bring about consequences for those who choose to ignore His call and pursue evil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>God desires a relationship with His people, and listening to His voice is crucial for walking in His ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and has the authority to choose the appropriate response to human disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_choosing_against_god's_delight.htm">The Danger of Choosing Against God's Delight</a></b><br>Deliberately choosing actions that displease God leads to spiritual and sometimes physical consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_call.htm">Responding to God's Call</a></b><br>It is vital to respond to God's call with obedience and humility, recognizing His wisdom and authority.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_66_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 66:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_66_4_Ignoring_God_brings_consequences.htm">How does Isaiah 66:4 illustrate the consequences of ignoring God's call?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_I_choose_punishments_show.htm">What does "I will choose their punishments" reveal about God's justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_being_among_the_wicked.htm">How can we ensure we are not among those who "did evil"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_66_4_Prov_1_24-31_on_folly.htm">Connect Isaiah 66:4 with Proverbs 1:24-31 on ignoring God's wisdom.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_hear_God_s_voice_and_avoid_sin.htm">How can we discern God's voice to avoid "what I did not delight in"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_choose_delusions_in_Isa_66_4.htm">Why does Isaiah 66:4 depict God choosing delusions for those who reject Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_66_4_s_impact_on_free_will.htm">How does Isaiah 66:4 challenge the concept of free will in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Isaiah_66_4_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Isaiah 66:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_66.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 66?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_can_a_loving_deity_enact_vengeance.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16: How can a loving deity be reconciled with the depiction of fiery vengeance and widespread destruction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_hell_eternal_(matt_25_46_vs_mal_4_1).htm">Is hell eternal?

These are the instruments with which God, as it were, mocks and has in derision those who mock Him by their hypocrisy. Their choice did not delight Him; what He chooses will be far other than delightful for them. (Comp. <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm" title="He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.">Psalm 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/proverbs/1-24.htm" title="Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;">Proverbs 1:24-26</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their delusions</span>; or, <span class="accented">their childish follies</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). As God sends on some men "strong delusion that they should believe a lie" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>), so on others he sends a spirit of childish folly, which makes their conduct silly and headstrong.
