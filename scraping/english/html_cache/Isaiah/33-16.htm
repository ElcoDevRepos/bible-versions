In biblical times, high places were considered secure from enemies and symbolized divine protection. The imagery of dwelling on heights can be linked to <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, where those who dwell in the shelter of the Most High are promised safety. It also reflects the idea of spiritual elevation, being set apart from worldly concerns, and living in a state of holiness and righteousness.<p><b>the mountain fortress will be his refuge;</b><br>Mountains in the Bible often symbolize strength and stability. A fortress on a mountain would be nearly impregnable, offering protection from adversaries. This imagery can be connected to God being described as a fortress in <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, emphasizing His role as a protector and defender. Historically, cities like Jerusalem were built on elevated terrain, providing a strategic advantage against invaders. Spiritually, this phrase underscores the believer's reliance on God as their ultimate refuge and strength.<p><b>his food will be provided and his water assured.</b><br>This promise of provision reflects God's faithfulness in meeting the needs of His people. In the wilderness, God provided manna and water for the Israelites (Exodus 16-17), demonstrating His ability to sustain them. The assurance of food and water also points to the spiritual nourishment found in Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>) and offers living water (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).
