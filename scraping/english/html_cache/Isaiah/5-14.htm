In the context of Isaiah, Sheol's "enlarging" suggests an increase in the number of those who will face judgment and death due to their sins. This imagery emphasizes the consequences of Israel's disobedience and moral decay. The concept of Sheol is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a> and <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, where it is portrayed as insatiable.<p><b>and opens wide its enormous jaws</b><br>The imagery of Sheol's "enormous jaws" conveys a sense of impending doom and the inevitability of divine judgment. This metaphor highlights the seriousness of God's wrath against sin. The depiction of Sheol as a devouring entity is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, where death is described as never satisfied.<p><b>and down go Zion&#8217;s nobles and masses</b><br>"Zion" refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel.

This phrase underscores the moral corruption prevalent in society, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. Similar warnings against such behavior are found in <a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4-7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12-14</a>, where indulgence leads to downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheol.htm">Sheol</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and silence.

Because the people pursued greed (v. 8), pursued pleasure without God (v. 11-12), and ignored His mighty deeds (v. 12), judgment must come. Just as the flood followed the corruption of Noah&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-13</a>) and fire fell on Sodom after persistent wickedness (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), consequence follows unrepentant sin. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a> notes the same pattern: God sends repeated warnings, but when they are despised &#8220;there was no remedy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sheol enlarges its throat</b><p>&#8220;Sheol&#8221; pictures the realm of the dead making room for unprecedented numbers.

The &#8220;enormous jaws&#8221; portray how rebellion creates a vacuum that only destruction can fill, much like the floodgates of wrath in <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Down go Zion&#8217;s nobles and masses</b><p>Judgment is impartial.

God&#8217;s justice falls on every social layer&#8212;leaders and followers, party-goers and common folk&#8212;because all have spurned His gracious calls to repentance. The verse reminds us that death and judgment are real, literal outcomes for a nation and an individual who turn from the Lord, but its sober tone also urges us to seek refuge in the only Deliverer who conquers Sheol: the Messiah foretold in Isaiah and revealed in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Therefore hell hath enlarged herself.</span>--The Hebrew <span class= "ital">Sheol, </span>or <span class= "ital">Hades, </span>like "hell" itself in its original meaning, expressed not a place of torment, but the vast shadow ? world of death, thought of as being below the earth (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-14.htm" title="Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.">Psalm 49:14</a>).

In that unseen world there were, in the later belief of Judaism, the two regions of Gehenna and of Eden or Paradise. What the prophet says is that all the pomp and glory of the rich oppressors are on their way to that inevitable doom. The word for "glory" (as in <a href="/1_samuel/4-22.htm" title="And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.">1Samuel 4:22</a>) is the same as that for "honourable men" in <a href="/isaiah/5-13.htm" title="Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.">Isaiah 5:13</a>, so that the original has all the emphasis of repetition. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore hell hath enlarged herself</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hath enlarged her desire</span> (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>). "Hell" here represents the underworld, into which souls descended at death, not yet perhaps recognized as comprehending two divisions, but regarded much as the Greeks regarded their Hades - as a general receptacle of the dead, dark and silent. Hades (<span class="accented">Sheol</span>), not viewed as a person, but personified by poetical license, "enlarges her desire" and "opens her mouth" to receive the crowd that is approaching the crowd of those who in captivity succumb to the hardships of their lot. <span class="cmt_word">Their glory</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her glory</span> - the glory, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Jerusalem, which is especially in the prophet's thoughts. "Her glory, and <span class="accented">her</span> crowd, and her pomp, and he that is joyful <span class="accented">in her</span>, shall go down" into the <span class="accented">sheol</span> that gapes for them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sheol</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7585.htm">Strong's 7585: </a> </span><span class="str2">Underworld (place to which people descend at death)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">enlarges</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1489;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7337.htm">Strong's 7337: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or grow wide or large</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its throat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
