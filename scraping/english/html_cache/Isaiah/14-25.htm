The "land" refers to the land of Israel, God's chosen territory. Historically, Assyria was known for its military might and oppressive rule, often seen as an instrument of God's judgment against Israel for their disobedience. However, God promises to break Assyria's power, indicating a shift from judgment to deliverance. This act of breaking Assyria can be seen as a fulfillment of God's covenant promises to protect His people and preserve them. The breaking of Assyria is also a foreshadowing of God's ultimate victory over all oppressive powers, pointing to the eschatological hope found in Christ's return.<p><b>I will trample him on My mountain.</b><br>The "mountain" here likely refers to Mount Zion, a symbol of God's holy presence and His sovereign rule. In biblical literature, mountains often represent places of divine encounter and authority. God's trampling of Assyria on His mountain signifies His supreme power and authority over nations. This imagery of trampling is reminiscent of a warrior's victory over his enemies, emphasizing God's role as a divine warrior who fights for His people. Theologically, this can be connected to the ultimate victory of Christ, who will defeat all enemies and establish His kingdom on earth, as seen in Revelation.<p><b>His yoke will be taken off My people,</b><br>The "yoke" symbolizes oppression and servitude. In ancient times, a yoke was used to control and direct animals, and metaphorically, it represents the burdens imposed by foreign powers. God's promise to remove the Assyrian yoke from His people signifies liberation and freedom. This liberation is not just political but also spiritual, pointing to the greater deliverance from sin and death through Jesus Christ. The removal of the yoke is a theme echoed in the New Testament, where Christ invites those who are weary to take His yoke, which is easy and light (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>and his burden removed from their shoulders.&#8221;</b><br>The "burden" refers to the heavy taxes, forced labor, and military conscription imposed by Assyria. Removing this burden indicates a restoration of peace and prosperity for God's people. This act of deliverance is a testament to God's faithfulness and His desire for His people to live in freedom and joy. In a broader theological context, this removal of burden prefigures the work of Christ, who removes the burden of sin and offers rest to believers. The imagery of burden removal is also seen in the Exodus narrative, where God delivers Israel from Egyptian bondage, serving as a type of the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its military might and oppression of Israel and Judah.

The same LORD who freed Israel from Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>) now intervenes again, showing He never tires of redeeming His people.<p>&#8226; This liberation anticipates the ultimate release Jesus offers: &#8220;So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his burden removed from their shoulders</b><p>&#8226; The phrase completes the picture of total relief&#8212;no more crushing taxes, no more conscription, no more fear. <a href="/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a> applies similar language to Nineveh&#8217;s fall: &#8220;I will break his yoke from upon you and tear away your shackles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern is consistent: He lifts burdens (<a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>) and invites the weary to find rest in Him (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; The removal of Assyria&#8217;s burden reassures every generation that whatever the oppressor&#8212;sin, Satan, or hostile governments&#8212;God is able and willing to lift it in His perfect timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/14-25.htm">Isaiah 14:25</a> showcases the LORD&#8217;s personal intervention on His own turf, His public humiliation of a proud empire, and His tender rescue of a burdened people.

The Assyrian yoke, imposed by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-10</a>), and (according to his own inscriptions) again by Sargon, was thrown off by Hezekiah, who "rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not" (<a href="/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>). It was this rebellion that provoked the expedition of Sennacherib, described in <a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>; and it may be this rejection of the yoke which is here prophesied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/14-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will break</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;b&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
