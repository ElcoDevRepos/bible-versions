The term "stubborn" reflects Israel's repeated resistance to God's commands and guidance. Historically, Israel's stubbornness is evident in their frequent idolatry and disobedience, despite witnessing God's miracles and receiving His law. This stubbornness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 32) and during the period of the judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The stubbornness of Israel serves as a warning to believers about the dangers of hardening one's heart against God.<p><b>your neck is iron</b><br>The imagery of an "iron neck" suggests inflexibility and an unwillingness to bow or submit. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a stiff neck was a metaphor for pride and rebellion. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, where God calls Israel a "stiff-necked people." The iron neck symbolizes a refusal to yield to God's authority, contrasting with the pliability and humility that God desires from His people.<p><b>and your forehead is bronze.</b><br>A "bronze forehead" symbolizes a hardened and unyielding mind. In biblical times, bronze was a strong and durable metal, often used in armor and weaponry. This imagery suggests a mental and spiritual obstinacy, where the people are resistant to correction and truth. The forehead, being the most visible part of the face, represents one's thoughts and attitudes. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7-9</a>, where God tells Ezekiel that He has made his forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint, to stand against Israel's rebellion. The bronze forehead indicates a deep-seated defiance against God's will, emphasizing the need for repentance and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
