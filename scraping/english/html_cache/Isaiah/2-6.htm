Historically, this reflects periods when Israel turned away from God, leading to consequences such as invasions and exiles. Theologically, it underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine discipline. This abandonment is not permanent but serves as a call to repentance.<p><b>because they are filled with influences from the east</b><br>The "influences from the east" likely refer to the adoption of pagan practices and ideologies from neighboring eastern nations such as Assyria and Babylon. These influences included idolatry and astrology, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh.

The Philistines, known for their pagan practices, serve as a negative comparison, highlighting Israel's spiritual decline. This phrase emphasizes the syncretism that had infiltrated Israelite society, where they adopted practices from their enemies, contrary to God's commands.<p><b>they strike hands with the children of foreigners</b><br>"Striking hands" implies making agreements or alliances, often with pagan nations, which God had warned against (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>). This phrase suggests political and social alliances that led to spiritual compromise. Such alliances often resulted in Israel adopting foreign gods and practices, leading to further estrangement from God.

The abandonment in 2:6 is therefore judicial, not capricious&#8212;God is honoring the moral terms of His covenant (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment He remains consistent with His promises; later chapters (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7</a>) make clear that forsaking is for a moment, while mercy is His ultimate plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they are filled with influences from the east</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Filled&#8221; pictures spiritual saturation.

The prophet, in calling upon Israel to "walk in the light of the Lord," implies that they are not so walking. He then proceeds to give the reasons of this. They are not, "for God has forsaken them, or, cast them off." The first reason is <span class="cmt_word">because they be replenished from the east</span> (Revised Version, "they be filled <span class="accented">with customs</span> from the east); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they have adopted a number of Syrian, Assyrian, and Ammonite superstitions; e.g. high places, images, and "groves," the burning of their children in honor of Moloch, the use of divination and enchantment, etc. (<a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-12, 16, 17</a>, etc.). Most of these practices reached the Israelites from Syria, though many had their origin either in Assyria or Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Soothsayers</span>, <span class="cmt_word">like the Philistines.</span> The "diviners" of the Philistines are mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/6-2.htm">1 Samuel 6:2</a>. By the word here employed, it would seem that they foretold the future from observations on the clouds and the general appearance of the sky. During the reign of Uzziah, the Israelites had been brought into closer contact with the Philistines than usual, through his conquest of several of their cities (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They please themselves in the children of strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">strike hands with the children of strangers</span> (comp. <a href="/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>). This is thought to refer to striking hands upon a bargain (Cheyne), and to be an allusion to the commercial activity of the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). But perhaps it does not mean more than familiarity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You have abandoned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1496;&#1463;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7789;a&#353;&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5203.htm">Strong's 5203: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pound, smite, to disperse, to thrust off, down, out, upon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Your people,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
