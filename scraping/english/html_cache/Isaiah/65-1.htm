It reflects the grace and sovereignty of God, who chooses to reveal Himself even to those who are indifferent or unaware of their need for Him. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the inclusion of the Gentiles into the covenant community, as Paul references in <a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>, where he applies this verse to the Gentiles' acceptance of the Gospel. Historically, Israel often turned away from God, yet He continually reached out to them, demonstrating His patience and desire for reconciliation.<p><b>I was found by those who did not seek Me.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unexpected nature of God's revelation. It suggests that God's presence and truth can be discovered by those who are not actively searching for Him, indicating His omnipresence and the universal scope of His salvation plan. This can be connected to the parable of the lost sheep in <a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>, where the shepherd seeks out the lost sheep, symbolizing God's pursuit of those who are lost. It also reflects the idea that God's grace is not limited by human effort or merit.<p><b>To a nation that did not call My name,</b><br>Here, the "nation" can be understood as a reference to the Gentiles, who were historically outside the covenant relationship with God that Israel enjoyed. This phrase underscores the theme of God's grace extending beyond the boundaries of Israel to include all nations. It aligns with the prophetic vision of a future where all nations will come to worship the God of Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>. This expansion of God's covenant is fulfilled in the New Testament through the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>I said, &#8216;Here I am! Here I am!&#8217;</b><br>This repetition emphasizes God's eagerness and readiness to be found by those who are willing to respond to His call. It reflects God's persistent invitation to relationship and His desire to be known by all people. The phrase "Here I am" echoes God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where He declares His eternal presence and faithfulness. It also points to the incarnation of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity, as stated in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, revealing His initiative in reaching out to people who were not actively seeking Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation_of_israel.htm">The Nation of Israel</a></b><br>Historically, the primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, often characterized by their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>By extension, this verse is seen as a prophetic reference to the inclusion of the Gentiles, who were not originally seeking the God of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_revelation.htm">The Event of Revelation</a></b><br>God's self-disclosure to those who were not actively pursuing Him, highlighting His grace and initiative.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_initiative.htm">Divine Initiative</a></b><br>God takes the first step in revealing Himself to humanity, demonstrating His grace and desire for relationship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/grace_to_the_unworthy.htm">Grace to the Unworthy</a></b><br>This verse highlights God's grace in reaching out to those who are not seeking Him, reminding us of the unmerited favor we receive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call.htm">Universal Call</a></b><br>God's revelation is not limited to a specific group; it extends to all nations, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/response_to_god's_call.htm">Response to God's Call</a></b><br>While God reveals Himself, there is an implied call to respond.

In Isaiah&#8217;s context, this is a rebuke to Israel for ignoring the LORD while a preview of mercy to outsiders.<p>- Scripture consistently portrays God as the Seeker: &#8220;The LORD God called to the man, &#8216;Where are you?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>); &#8220;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>).<p>- Paul cites this line to show God turning to the Gentiles: &#8220;Isaiah boldly says: &#8216;I was found by those who did not seek Me&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>).<p>- Practical take-away: salvation begins with divine revelation, never with human initiative. That truth stirs gratitude and humbles pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was found by those who did not seek Me</b><p>- When God unveils Himself, even the uninterested recognize Him. Think of the Samaritan woman who &#8220;left her water jar&#8221; after Christ revealed Himself (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28</a>).<p>- Jesus illustrates this grace in the shepherd who searches until he finds the lost sheep (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-6</a>).<p>- Humanity&#8217;s default is indifference: &#8220;There is no one who seeks God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11</a>). The moment anyone &#8220;finds&#8221; Him, it is proof He first found them.<p>- For believers today, evangelism rests on this assurance: God is already at work in hearts we might assume are closed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To a nation that did not call My name, I said, &#8216;Here I am! Here I am!&#8217;</b><p>- &#8220;Nation&#8221; points beyond Israel to the Gentile world&#8212;people with no covenant claim on Yahweh. Yet He twice cries, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; underscoring eagerness to be known.<p>- Hosea foresaw this embrace: &#8220;I will call those who are not My people, &#8216;My people&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25</a> quoting <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>). Peter echoes it to Gentile believers: &#8220;Once you were not a people, but now you are God&#8217;s people&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>).<p>- The repetition highlights God&#8217;s patience. Even when Israel ignored His prophets (<a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>), He kept extending Himself&#8212;first to them, then to the nations (<a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46-48</a>).<p>- Application: God&#8217;s heart still beats for every people group. Our mission echoes His call, &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; by pointing the unreached to the Savior who is already near.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm">Isaiah 65:1</a> proclaims God&#8217;s sovereign grace: He reveals, He is found, He calls. Israel&#8217;s refusal opened a door the Gentiles never dreamed of, proving that salvation depends on God&#8217;s initiative, not human pursuit. For every believer, the verse fuels humility, worship, and confidence that the God who once said &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; still seeks, saves, and sends today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/65.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>LXV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">I am sought of them . . .</span>--Is this the answer to the previous prayer? Most commentators say "Yes;" but there is, at least, an apparent absence of continuous sequence. A more probable view is that it was written after an interval more or less considerable, and that the prophet utters what had been revealed to him as explaining why the plaintive appeal of <a href="/isaiah/64-12.htm" title="Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?">Isaiah 64:12</a> did not meet at once with the answer that might have been looked for.<p>A further question meets us, which has received different answers. Do the opening words speak, as St. Paul implies they do, of the calling of the Gentiles, contrasting their faith with the unbelief of Israel (<a href="/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.">Romans 10:20</a>)? Taking the text as it stands, the most natural interpretation (there being no reference afterwards to the Gentiles) seems to be that Jehovah speaks to the same people in <a href="/context/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1-2</a>, and that both alike speak of indifference and hardness. On this view the words may be translated, <span class= "ital">I was ready to answer those who did not enquire, was nigh at hand to be discovered by those who did not seek<span class= "bld">. . .</span> .</span> Such words were a true description of the state of Israel, as they have been of Christian Churches since, and are in close agreement with what follows. On this view St. Paul's free use of the LXX. rendering must be looked on as analogous to the like application of <a href="/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-1.htm" title="Say you to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.">Hosea 2:1</a>, by him (<a href="/context/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25-26</a>) and by St. Peter (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>), though in these instances it is beyond question that the words primarily referred to the Jews, and not to the Gentiles. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/65.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL'S SUFFERINGS THE JUST MEED OF THEIR SINS.

The application of the text by St. Paul (<a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>) to the calling of the Gentiles will be felt by all believers in inspiration to preclude the interpretation which supposes Israel to be the subject of ver. 1 no less than of vers. 2-7. <span class="cmt_word">I said, Behold me</span>.
