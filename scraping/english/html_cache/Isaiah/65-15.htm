In biblical times, names held significant meaning and were often reflective of one's character or destiny. The idea of a name becoming a curse suggests a complete reversal of fortune and reputation. This is reminiscent of other biblical figures whose names became bywords for evil, such as Judas. The "chosen ones" refers to the faithful remnant of Israel, God's elect, who are set apart for His purposes. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises to protect and vindicate them.<p><b>and the Lord GOD will slay you</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the certainty of divine retribution. The use of "Lord GOD" emphasizes the sovereignty and authority of God in executing judgment. Historically, this can be seen as a warning to those in Israel who were unfaithful, aligning with the broader prophetic theme of judgment against idolatry and injustice. The slaying is both literal and metaphorical, indicating both physical destruction and spiritual separation from God. This echoes the fate of the unrepentant throughout the prophetic books, where God's justice is portrayed as inevitable and righteous.<p><b>but to His servants He will give another name</b><br>The promise of "another name" signifies a new identity and status bestowed by God. In biblical tradition, receiving a new name often marks a transformation or a new mission, as seen with Abram becoming Abraham or Jacob becoming Israel. This new name represents a fresh start and a renewed relationship with God. For the faithful remnant, it symbolizes their vindication and the blessings of being God's servants. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are given a new identity in Christ, reflecting the transformative power of salvation and the hope of eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just ruler who enacts judgment and blessing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_chosen_ones.htm">My chosen ones</a></b><br>Refers to God's faithful people, often understood as the remnant of Israel or those who follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>Those who serve and obey God, receiving His favor and a new identity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cursed_name.htm">The cursed name</a></b><br>Represents the legacy of those who rebel against God, becoming a byword for judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_name.htm">Another name</a></b><br>Symbolizes a new identity and blessing given by God to His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>Those who turn away from God leave behind a legacy of judgment.
