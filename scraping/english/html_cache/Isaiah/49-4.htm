The speaker, often understood as the Servant of the Lord, expresses a sense of futility in his mission. This can be seen as a parallel to the experiences of many prophets, including Elijah and Jeremiah, who also felt their efforts were in vain. It highlights the human aspect of the Servant, who experiences emotions and doubts. This sentiment is echoed in the New Testament by the Apostle Paul, who sometimes felt his labor was in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p><b>I have spent My strength in futility and vanity;</b><br>The Servant acknowledges the exhaustion and apparent lack of results from his efforts. This can be related to the cultural context of ancient Israel, where prophets often faced opposition and rejection. The terms "futility" and "vanity" suggest a sense of emptiness and lack of purpose, which contrasts with the ultimate success and fulfillment of God's plans. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite facing rejection and crucifixion, ultimately fulfilled His mission.<p><b>yet My vindication is with the LORD,</b><br>Despite feelings of failure, the Servant places his trust in God for justification and validation. This reflects a deep faith and reliance on God's sovereignty and justice. The concept of vindication is significant in the biblical narrative, as it assures that God's purposes will prevail despite human perception. This is reminiscent of Jesus' trust in the Father, especially during His trial and crucifixion, knowing that His vindication would come through the resurrection.<p><b>and My reward is with My God.&#8221;</b><br>The Servant expresses confidence that his reward is not dependent on human recognition but is assured by God. This aligns with the biblical theme that true reward comes from God, not from earthly success or acknowledgment. It encourages believers to focus on divine approval rather than human accolades. This perspective is reinforced in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to seek their reward from God (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-6</a>). The Servant's assurance of reward foreshadows the ultimate reward of Christ's exaltation and the salvation of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.

Isaiah has already identified this Servant as the One through whom God will display His glory (<a href="/isaiah/49-3.htm">Isaiah 49:3</a>). Still, the Servant pauses to describe what things look like from a ground-level perspective. Other faithful voices have done the same&#8212;think of Elijah&#8217;s &#8220;I, even I only, am left&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>) or Jeremiah&#8217;s weary lament (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7&#8211;9</a>). Their candor does not contradict God&#8217;s sovereignty; it simply shows that real servants bring real feelings to the Lord instead of stuffing them down.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have labored in vain</b><p>From the outside, the Servant&#8217;s mission seems to have yielded little fruit. Jesus Himself experienced this when &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). Paul felt the same tension: &#8220;I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>). Moments like these remind us that visible results are not the ultimate test of obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have spent My strength in futility and vanity</b><p>The Servant has poured Himself out completely. Isaiah will later describe Him as &#8220;poured out to death&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). Paul echoes the image when he says, &#8220;Even if I am being poured out as a drink offering&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). Exhaustion does not always mean failure; it can simply mean faithfulness lived to the limit. Yet from a purely human vantage point, such pouring out can feel empty&#8212;&#8220;futility and vanity.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet My vindication is with the LORD</b><p>The hinge of the verse swings on that little word &#8220;yet.&#8221; Appearances can whisper defeat, but the Servant anchors His confidence in God&#8217;s verdict, not man&#8217;s. Isaiah has already assured us, &#8220;He who vindicates Me is near&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>). Peter later notes that Jesus &#8220;entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). In every season, the Lord retains the right to define success and to reveal it in His time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and My reward is with My God</b><p>The Servant looks beyond the moment to the promise. Isaiah earlier announced, &#8220;Behold, the Lord GOD comes with power&#8230; His reward is with Him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>). Jesus lived by that truth: &#8220;For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). The same assurance steadies believers: &#8220;Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). Even if people misread the story, God&#8217;s final recompense cannot be misplaced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a> captures the Servant&#8217;s real-time struggle: wholehearted labor that looks like loss. Yet the verse refuses to end in discouragement. While the Servant admits fatigue and apparent futility, He locks His eyes on the Father&#8217;s verdict and the Father&#8217;s reward. For every disciple, the pattern holds&#8212;obedience may seem ineffective, but God keeps impeccable records, vindicates His servants, and will reward them in due season.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Then I said.</span>--The accents of disappointment sound strangely on coming from the lips of the true Servant; but the prophet had learnt by his own experience that this formed part of the discipline of every true servant of God, in proportion to the thoroughness of his service, and therefore it was not strange to him that <span class= "ital">the </span>ideal Servant should also taste that bitterness. We find in the prophet of Anathoth a partial illustration of the law (<a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm" title="Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.">Jeremiah 20:14</a>). We find its highest fulfilment in the cries of Gethsemane and Golgotha, The sense of failure is surmounted only, as here, by looking to another judgment than man's, and another <span class= "ital">reward </span>(better than "work"). (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm" title="But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self.">1Corinthians 4:3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I said, I have laboured in vain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and I</span>, <span class="accented">for my part</span>, <span class="accented">had said.</span> The Servant had momentarily desponded, seeing the small results of all his efforts to reclaim Israel, and had felt a natural human regret at so much labour apparently expended in vain; but his despondency had been soon checked by the thought that God would not suffer any "labour of love" to be wholly in vain, but would give it the recompense which it merited. The verse brings strongly out the true humanity of the "Servant," who feels as men naturally feel, but restrains himself, and does not allow his feelings to carry him away. Compare with this despondency the grief exhibited by our Lord on two occasions (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), and the depression which extorted from him the memorable words, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"
