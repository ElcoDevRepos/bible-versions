The desert, typically a place of silence and isolation, is transformed into a place of proclamation. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and the spread of God's glory to all corners of the earth. The cities in the desert may refer to settlements that are often overlooked, emphasizing that God's message is for everyone, regardless of their status or location.<p><b>let the villages of Kedar cry aloud.</b><br>Kedar was a nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, known for their tents and flocks. They were located in the Arabian Peninsula, representing the Gentile nations. The call for Kedar to cry aloud signifies the inclusion of Gentiles in the worship of Yahweh, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation that salvation through Christ is available to all nations. This also highlights the prophetic vision of unity and peace among diverse peoples under God's reign.<p><b>Let the people of Sela sing for joy;</b><br>Sela, often identified with Petra in modern-day Jordan, was a city known for its rock-hewn architecture. The call for its people to sing for joy suggests a transformation from a place of refuge and defense to one of celebration and openness. This can be seen as a type of the Church, built on the "rock" of Christ, where believers find both refuge and a reason for joy. The joy of Sela's people reflects the joy of salvation and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>let them cry out from the mountaintops.</b><br>Mountaintops are often associated with divine encounters and revelation in the Bible, such as Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai. Crying out from the mountaintops symbolizes the public and elevated proclamation of God's glory and salvation. It suggests that the message of God's redemption is not to be hidden but declared boldly and widely. This imagery also connects to the Great Commission, where believers are called to spread the Gospel to all nations, reaching the highest and most remote places.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/desert_and_its_cities.htm">Desert and its Cities</a></b><br>Refers to the arid regions and their inhabitants, symbolizing places that are often barren but are called to rejoice and proclaim God's glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/villages_of_kedar.htm">Villages of Kedar</a></b><br>Kedar was a nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, known for their tents and flocks.

Yet God commands praise to erupt even there, showing that no place is beyond His redeeming reach (<a href="/isaiah/35-1.htm">Isaiah 35:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-12.htm">Psalm 65:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Cities&#8221; in the wilderness likely point to small settlements of nomads and traders. The gospel will not be confined to Jerusalem; it will echo through waystations and caravan stops (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26&#8211;39</a>, the Ethiopian eunuch on a desert road).<p>&#8226; The context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42</a> is the revelation of the Servant of the Lord (vv. 1&#8211;9). Once He appears, creation itself responds (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19&#8211;21</a>). Even dusty hamlets will &#8220;raise their voices,&#8221; fulfilling the call of <a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a> to &#8220;Sing to the LORD a new song.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let the villages of Kedar cry aloud</b><p>&#8220;let the villages of Kedar cry aloud&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>b).<p>&#8226; Kedar, descended from Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13</a>), occupied Arabia&#8217;s northern deserts. Their tents and flocks symbolized nomadic life (Song of Songs 1:5; <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>). By singling out Kedar, God affirms that the promised salvation extends to Gentile peoples who once stood outside Israel&#8217;s covenant (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Cry aloud&#8221; indicates exuberant, public worship, not polite admiration. Prophecies later depict Arabian tribes bringing offerings to Zion (<a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6&#8211;7</a>), proving that the Servant&#8217;s light breaks ethnic barriers (<a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a> places &#8220;Rahab and Babylon&#8230; Philistia&#8230; Tyre, and Cush&#8221; among those born in Zion. <a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a> anticipates that same chorus by adding Kedar to the list of unlikely worshippers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops</b><p>&#8220;Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them cry out from the mountaintops&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>c).<p>&#8226; Sela (&#8220;rock&#8221;) was a fortress city in Edom, later known as Petra (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>). Edom often opposed Israel, yet its inhabitants will &#8220;sing for joy,&#8221; illustrating grace toward former enemies (<a href="/isaiah/19-24.htm">Isaiah 19:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Mountaintops&#8221; convey two ideas:<p>&#8211; Elevation amplifies the praise&#8212;nothing hides what God has done (<a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Mountains symbolize stability; the joy is not fleeting but anchored like the rocky heights around Sela (<a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The double verbs &#8220;sing&#8221; and &#8220;cry out&#8221; mirror the pattern of the verse: silence is broken, isolation shattered, and distant voices unite in one anthem (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a> paints a widening circle of praise: barren deserts, Arab encampments, and mountain strongholds all respond to the Servant&#8217;s arrival. The verse assures us that no geography, ethnicity, or past hostility can hinder the spread of His salvation. From wastelands to rocky citadels, the whole earth is invited to lift its voice, proving that the glory of the Lord will indeed fill every corner of creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness and the cities thereof</span>.

Its villages were probably collections of tents, which were moved from time to time, since the Beni-Kedar were nomads (ch. 21:16; <a href="/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>).
