Eliakim was the palace administrator, Shebna was the secretary, and Joah was the recorder. Their roles indicate they were trusted advisors and held significant authority. The Rabshakeh was a high-ranking Assyrian military officer, likely a title rather than a personal name, sent by King Sennacherib of Assyria. This encounter occurs during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, a critical moment in Judah's history, highlighting the tension between the Assyrian empire and the kingdom of Judah.<p><b>&#8220;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it.</b><br>Aramaic was the diplomatic and trade language of the Near East at the time, understood by educated officials but not by the common people. The request to speak in Aramaic was an attempt to prevent panic among the people of Jerusalem who were listening. This reflects the political and social dynamics of the time, where language played a crucial role in communication and control. The use of Aramaic also underscores the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.<p><b>Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.&#8221;</b><br>Hebrew was the language of the people of Judah, and speaking in Hebrew would allow the common people to understand the conversation, potentially causing fear and unrest. The officials' request indicates their concern for maintaining morale and control over the populace during a time of crisis. This moment foreshadows the eventual spread of fear and the challenge of maintaining faith in God's protection, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.

The Syrian or Aramaic was a common ground for the ambassadors on both sides, as being the language of commerce and diplomacy. Rabshakeh, it would seem, could speak three languages, Assyrian, Syrian, and Hebrew; Hezekiah's ministers the two latter; the "people on the wall" only the last.<p><span class= "bld">In the Jews' language.</span>--It is uncertain whether this means simply Hebrew, which Isaiah elsewhere calls the language of Canaan (<a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm" title="In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.">Isaiah 19:18</a>), or a special dialect of Judah. The Moabite stone, on the one hand, shows that Hebrew was the common speech of Palestine and the border countries. On the other hand, dialects spring up quickly. <a href="/nehemiah/13-24.htm" title="And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.">Nehemiah 13:24</a> is the only other passage (the parallels of <a href="/2_kings/18-26.htm" title="Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.">2Kings 18:26</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/32-18.htm" title="Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.">2Chronicles 32:18</a> excepted) in which the term meets us in the narrower sense, and that is after the exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak... unto thy servants in the Syrian language</span>; literally, in <span class="accented">the Aramaic language.</span> Aramaeans were widely spread over the entire region between the Lower Tigris and the Mediterranean; and their language seems to have been in general use, as a language of commerce. "Private contract tablets in Aramaic and <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> have been found in the remains of ancient Nineveh" (Cheyne). Rabshakeh had, perhaps, spoken "in the Jews' language " without any ill intent, thinking that it was the only tongue which Jewish envoys would understand; but his so doing was calculated to affect the minds of the common people, and to shake their allegiance to Hezekiah. The envoys, therefore, requested him to employ a foreign tongue, and suggested Aramaic as one which was familiar to them, and which they supposed that he would understand. His employment of Hebrew had shown them that he was a linguist. <span class="cmt_word">In the Jews' language</span>. There was no language peculiar to the Jews as Jews, that is to say, different from the ordinary speech of the Israelites. Both alike spoke Hebrew. In the Old Testament, however, this corn-men language is never called "Hebrew," but either "the tongue of Canaan" (<a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>) or "the Jewish language" (<a href="/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26, 28</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-24.htm">Nehemiah 13:24</a>). Similarly, our own tongue is called "English," though spoken also in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, America, and Australia. <span class="cmt_word">In the ears of the people that are on the wall</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the soldiers placed on the wall to defend it. We must suppose that the conference took place immediately outside the fortifications, so that some of those on the wall could hear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/36-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Eliakim,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_471.htm">Strong's 471: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eliakim -- 'God sets up', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Shebna,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;e&#7687;&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
