Thirst is a metaphor for spiritual longing and desire for God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>, where the psalmist expresses a deep yearning for God. The call is universal, echoing the inclusivity of God's grace.<p><b>come to the waters</b><br>Water symbolizes life and purification throughout Scripture. In <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, Jesus offers living water that quenches spiritual thirst eternally. The imagery of water also connects to the cleansing and renewing work of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>.<p><b>and you without money</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the grace of God, highlighting that salvation and spiritual fulfillment cannot be purchased or earned. It reflects the biblical principle of grace, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God.<p><b>come, buy, and eat!</b><br>The paradox of buying without money underscores the idea that what God offers is freely given. Eating signifies partaking in the sustenance and life that God provides, reminiscent of Jesus' invitation in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where He declares Himself the bread of life.<p><b>Come, buy wine and milk</b><br>Wine and milk represent abundance and nourishment. Wine is often associated with joy and celebration in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>. Milk symbolizes sustenance and growth, akin to the spiritual nourishment described in <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>.<p><b>without money and without cost!</b><br>This reiterates the theme of grace and the free nature of God's provision. It reflects the prophetic vision of a new covenant where God's blessings are accessible to all, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.

The prophet passes from the ideal to the actual, from the glorious future to the unsatisfactory present. The people are not ripe for the blessings of the Messianic kingdom - they do not sufficiently value them. Hence a tender exhortation is addressed to them by God himself, inviting them to become more spiritually minded (vers. 1-3), and fresh promises are held out to the obedient (vers. 3-5). The disobedient are then somewhat sternly exhorted to turn from their evil ways and repent (vers. 6, 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ho, every one that thirsteth!</span> Though the mass are gross and carnally minded, there will ever be some who have higher aspirations - who hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>), and desire spiritual blessings. These are invited, first of all, to come and partake of the good things provided for them in Messiah's kingdom<span class="cmt_word">. Come ye to the waters</span> (on the spiritual symbolism of water, see the homiletics on Isaiah 44:3, 4). Here the "peace" and "righteousness" of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13, 14</a>) are especially intended. Our Lord's cry on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>) is clearly an echo of this. <span class="cmt_word">Wine and</span> <span class="cmt_word">milk</span>. These are not symbols of temporal blessings, as many have thought. "Wine, water, and milk are," as Delitzsch says, "figurative representations of spiritual revival, re-creation, and nourishment." <span class="cmt_word">Without money and</span> <span class="cmt_word">without price</span>. God's spiritual gifts are freely given to men; they cannot be purchased. Being in their own nature "more precious than rubies," their value transcends human means of payment. They cannot even be earned by man's best works; for man's best works are comprised in his duty to God, and have, therefore, no purchasing power. God may choose to reward them; but if he does it is of his free grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/55-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Come,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah! alas! ha!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all of you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who thirst,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6771.htm">Strong's 6771: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thirsty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the waters;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
