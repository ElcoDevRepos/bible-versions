In the context of Isaiah, the prophet often addresses the Israelites, who have turned away from God's commandments. The call to "listen" is a plea for repentance and a return to obedience. This echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where Israel is commanded to "hear" and obey the Lord. The deafness here is not physical but spiritual, indicating a hardened heart.<p><b>look, you blind ones,</b><br>The blindness mentioned is symbolic of a lack of understanding or insight into God's will and purposes. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, blindness was often seen as a physical ailment that required healing, which Jesus frequently performed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-7</a>). This phrase foreshadows the coming of Christ, who would open the eyes of the spiritually blind, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. The call to "look" is an invitation to perceive and understand God's truth.<p><b>that you may see!</b><br>The purpose of the call to listen and look is so that the spiritually deaf and blind may gain true understanding and insight. This is a transformative process, akin to the conversion experience described in the New Testament, where believers are called out of darkness into light (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The ability to "see" spiritually is a gift from God, often associated with the work of the Holy Spirit in illuminating the hearts and minds of believers. This phrase underscores the hope and possibility of redemption and enlightenment for those who turn to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The prophet feels or sees that the great argument has not carried conviction as it ought to have done. The people to whom Jehovah speaks through him are still spiritually blind and deaf, and that people is ideally the servant of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>), in whom the pattern of the personal servant ought to have been reproduced. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39-41</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-25.</span> - ADDRESS TO CAPTIVE ISRAEL, CALLING UPON THEM TO TURN TO GOD, AND REMINDING THEM THAT THEY HAVE DESERVED THEIR AFFLICTIONS. By some critics the earlier verses of this passage (vers. 19-21) are regarded as having reference to the "Servant of the Lord" depicted in vers. 1-7, and as calling on the captive Jews to consider his voluntary humiliation, and the object of it. But this view seems to be strained. It requires "deaf" and "blind' to be taken in completely different senses in the two consecutive verses, 18 and 19. Probably Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne are right in taking the whole passage of captive Israel, and especially of that "outer circle" which was least deserving of God's favour and most open to rebuke and reproach. These "blind" and "deaf" ones are warned that it is high time for them to unclose their eyes and open their ears, and are reminded that all their recent and present sufferings arise from their former "blindness" and disobedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye deaf</span>. The "deaf" are not absolutely without hearing, nor the "blind" absolutely without sight. They can "hear" and "see," if they choose to do so. When they do not see, it is because they "wink with their eyes" (<a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>); when they do not hear, it is because, like the deaf adder, they "stop their ears" (<a href="/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>). This, at any rate, is the case with the majority. There may be some who have deadened their moral vision altogether, and have no longer any "ears to hear." God, however, addresses the mass of Israel as still possessed of moral discernment, if they will but use it, and calls upon them to wake up out of sleep - to "hear" and "see." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/42-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Listen,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you deaf,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2795.htm">Strong's 2795: </a> </span><span class="str2">Deaf</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and look,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#238;&#183;&#7789;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5027.htm">Strong's 5027: </a> </span><span class="str2">To scan, look intently at, to regard</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you blind,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1460;&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#8216;iw&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5787.htm">Strong's 5787: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that you may see.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 42:18 Hear you deaf and look you blind (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/42-17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 42:17"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 42:17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 42:19"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 42:19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
