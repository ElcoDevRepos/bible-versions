In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were often in rebellion, yet God promises to renew their hearts, leading them to genuine worship. This echoes the theme of God&#8217;s redemptive work seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give His people a new heart and spirit. The act of bringing praise to their lips signifies a change from idolatry and disobedience to true worship and acknowledgment of God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p><b>Peace, peace to those far and near,&#8221; says the LORD,</b><br>The repetition of "peace" underscores the completeness and abundance of the peace God offers. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but a holistic well-being and reconciliation with God. The mention of "those far and near" indicates the inclusivity of God&#8217;s promise, extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). This foreshadows the New Testament revelation in <a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>, where Christ preaches peace to those who are far and near, uniting Jews and Gentiles into one body.<p><b>&#8220;and I will heal them.&#8221;</b><br>God&#8217;s promise to heal is both physical and spiritual, addressing the brokenness caused by sin. Healing in the Old Testament often symbolizes restoration and forgiveness, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to heal the land if His people repent. This healing is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the Great Physician, bringing spiritual healing through His atoning sacrifice. The promise of healing also points to the eschatological hope of complete restoration in the new creation, where there will be no more pain or suffering (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, representing God Himself, who is the source of peace and healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_far_and_near.htm">Those Far and Near</a></b><br>This phrase refers to both the Israelites and the Gentiles, indicating God's inclusive promise of peace and healing to all people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, often in need of reassurance and hope.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Israelite nations, included in God's promise of peace, highlighting the universal scope of His salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_peace.htm">The Source of Peace</a></b><br>God is the ultimate source of peace, and His peace is available to all, regardless of their background or distance from Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_god's_promise.htm">Inclusivity of God's Promise</a></b><br>The message of peace is not limited to a specific group but extends to all humanity, reflecting God's universal love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/healing_and_restoration.htm">Healing and Restoration</a></b><br>God's promise includes not only peace but also healing, indicating His desire to restore and make whole those who turn to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_praise.htm">The Role of Praise</a></b><br>Praise is a natural response to receiving God's peace and healing, and it is through praise that we acknowledge His work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_peace.htm">Living in Peace</a></b><br>As recipients of God's peace, we are called to live in harmony with others, reflecting the peace we have received in our relationships and communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_57_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 57:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_57_19_Promote_peace_how.htm">How does Isaiah 57:19 encourage us to promote peace in our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_creating_praise_in_worship.htm">What does "creating praise on their lips" mean for our daily worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_57_19_Share_God_s_peace.htm">How can Isaiah 57:19 inspire us to share God's peace with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_57_19_to_Jesus_peace_teachings.htm">Connect Isaiah 57:19 with Jesus' teachings on peace in the New Testament.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_peace_to_all_today.htm">How can we apply "peace, peace to those far and near" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Isaiah_57_19_Peace_peace.htm">What does Isaiah 57:19 mean by "Peace, peace, to those far and near"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_57_19_and_God_s_peace_promise.htm">How does Isaiah 57:19 relate to God's promise of peace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Isaiah_57_19.htm">What historical context surrounds Isaiah 57:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_57.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 57?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/should_we_pray_for_peace_in_jerusalem.htm">Should we pray for peace in Jerusalem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_william_wilberforce.htm">What does 'No Peace for the Wicked' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_poor_devout_reconcile_psalm_112_3.htm">Psalm 112:3 declares that the righteous will enjoy wealth and riches;
