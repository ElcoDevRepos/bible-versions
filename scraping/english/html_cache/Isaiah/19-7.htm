In ancient Egypt, these plants were vital for making papyrus, a material used for writing. The mention of bulrushes highlights the dependency of Egypt on the Nile for its economic and cultural activities. The imagery of bulrushes also evokes the story of Moses, who was hidden among the reeds of the Nile (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>). This connection underscores the historical significance of the Nile in biblical narratives and its role in God's deliverance of His people.<p><b>by the mouth of the river</b><br>The mouth of the river refers to the delta region where the Nile flows into the Mediterranean Sea. This area was fertile and crucial for agriculture, supporting the prosperity of ancient Egypt. The phrase indicates a geographical location that was essential for trade and sustenance. The prophecy of desolation here suggests a reversal of fortune, where the very source of Egypt's strength becomes a symbol of its downfall.<p><b>and all the fields sown along the Nile</b><br>The fields sown along the Nile were the backbone of Egypt's agricultural economy. The annual flooding of the Nile deposited nutrient-rich silt, making the land extremely fertile. This abundance allowed Egypt to become a powerful nation. The prophecy of these fields withering signifies a divine judgment that disrupts the natural order and prosperity that Egypt relied upon. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to alter the course of nations.<p><b>will wither, blow away, and be no more</b><br>The imagery of withering and blowing away conveys total desolation and loss. This prophecy foretells a time when Egypt's agricultural wealth will vanish, leading to economic and social collapse. The language echoes other biblical prophecies of judgment, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7-8</a>, where human achievements are compared to grass that withers. This serves as a warning of the impermanence of earthly power and the ultimate authority of God. The phrase also foreshadows the eschatological themes of renewal and restoration found in the broader narrative of Scripture, pointing to a future where God's kingdom will be established in fullness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nile_river.htm">The Nile River</a></b><br>A major river in Egypt, central to the nation's agriculture and economy.

These bulrushes symbolized the nation&#8217;s natural wealth and daily provision (compare <a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a> where Moses&#8217; basket is placed &#8220;among the reeds by the bank of the Nile,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By singling them out, God highlights that even the most commonplace, dependable signs of life in Egypt will be touched. As <a href="/psalms/104-16.htm">Psalm 104:16</a> notes, &#8220;The trees of the LORD drink their fill,&#8221; yet here the very plants tied to water will suffer.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that no earthly resource is beyond the Lord&#8217;s reach; He &#8220;dries up the sea&#8221; when He wills (<a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the mouth of the river</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;mouth&#8221; refers to the Nile Delta, the broad, fertile opening into the Mediterranean. This was Egypt&#8217;s agricultural heartland.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s warning stretches from the upriver reeds to the very outlet into the sea, leaving no portion of the river system untouched. This mirrors the comprehensive scope of earlier judgments&#8212;such as when every stream, canal, and reservoir turned to blood in <a href="/exodus/7-19.htm">Exodus 7:19-21</a>.<p>&#8226; The image echoes <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>: &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is in the hand of the LORD; He directs it like a watercourse&#8230;&#8221; Even mighty waterways submit to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the fields sown along the Nile</b><p>&#8226; Egypt depended on annual flooding to deposit fertile silt.
