These idols, often made of wood or metal, had to be physically transported by their worshippers, indicating their powerlessness. This contrasts with the God of Israel, who is omnipresent and does not require human effort to be moved or carried. The act of lifting and carrying emphasizes the burden and labor involved in idol worship, which is ultimately fruitless.<p><b>they set it in its place, and there it stands,</b><br>Once the idol is placed, it remains stationary, unable to move or act on its own. This immobility underscores the impotence of idols compared to the living God, who is active and sovereign. In the cultural context, setting an idol in a temple or shrine was meant to establish its presence and authority, yet the irony is that it is entirely dependent on human action. This can be contrasted with passages like <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>, where Solomon acknowledges that God cannot be contained by a physical space.<p><b>not budging from that spot.</b><br>The idol's inability to move signifies its lack of life and power. This immobility serves as a metaphor for the spiritual stagnation that results from idol worship. In contrast, the God of Israel is depicted throughout scripture as dynamic and involved in the lives of His people, guiding and delivering them. This phrase also reflects the prophetic critique of idolatry found in other parts of Isaiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the absurdity of idol-making is mocked.<p><b>They cry out to it, but it does not answer;</b><br>The futility of seeking help from idols is evident as they cannot respond to the cries of their worshippers. This highlights the contrast between the living God, who hears and answers prayers (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>), and lifeless idols. The inability of idols to respond is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing the unique relationship between God and His people, where communication is possible and effective.<p><b>it saves no one from his troubles.</b><br>Idols are powerless to deliver or save, a central theme in the prophetic literature. This phrase underscores the ultimate failure of relying on anything other than God for salvation and deliverance. The historical context of Israel, often tempted to turn to idols or foreign alliances for security, serves as a backdrop for this message. The promise of salvation is a key aspect of God's covenant with Israel, fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Savior (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
