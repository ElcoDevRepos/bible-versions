Fishing was a significant industry in ancient Egypt, particularly along the Nile River, which was a vital source of sustenance and commerce. The mourning of the fishermen indicates a disruption in their livelihood, reflecting a broader national calamity. This judgment can be seen as a consequence of Egypt's idolatry and reliance on false gods, as the Nile was often deified in Egyptian culture. The mourning also symbolizes the loss of prosperity and stability, which can be compared to the plagues in Exodus that demonstrated God's power over Egypt's gods.<p><b>all who cast a hook into the Nile will lament</b><br>Casting a hook into the Nile represents the individual efforts of fishermen who relied on the river for their daily sustenance. The lamentation signifies not only personal loss but also a collective despair as the natural resources they depended on are affected. The Nile was central to Egyptian life, and its disruption would have been catastrophic. This phrase can be connected to the broader theme of divine judgment found throughout the prophets, where natural elements are often used to demonstrate God's sovereignty and the futility of relying on anything other than Him.<p><b>and those who spread nets on the waters will pine away</b><br>Spreading nets was a common method of fishing, indicating a more organized and perhaps commercial approach to fishing compared to casting a hook. The phrase "pine away" suggests a gradual decline, emphasizing the prolonged suffering and hopelessness that comes with the judgment. This imagery can be linked to other biblical passages where economic collapse is a result of turning away from God (e.g., <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10-12</a>). The use of water imagery also connects to the idea of chaos and disorder, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where God's Spirit brings order to the waters. In a typological sense, the disruption of the Nile can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate judgment and restoration brought by Jesus Christ, who offers living water that never fails.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fishermen.htm">Fishermen</a></b><br>Individuals who rely on fishing as their livelihood.

Egypt&#8217;s international reputation rested on the Nile&#8217;s bounty (<a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>).

The fisherman's trade was extensively practiced in ancient Egypt, and anything which interfered with it would necessarily be regarded as a great calamity. A large class supported itself by the capture and sale of fish fresh or salted. The Nile produced great abundance of fish, both in its main stream and in its canals and backwaters. Lake Moeris also provided an extensive supply (Herod., 2:149). <span class="cmt_word">All they that east angle into the brooks</span>; rather, <span class="accented">into the river</span>. Fishing with a hook was practiced in Egypt, though not very widely, except as an amusement by the rich. Actual hooks have been found, not very different from modern ones (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 506), and representations of angling occur in some of the tombs. Sometimes a line only is used, sometimes a rod and line (see Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 101, 103, 2nd edit.). <span class="cmt_word">They that spread nets</span>. Nets were very much more widely employed than lines and hooks.
