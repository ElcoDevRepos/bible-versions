It connects to the eschatological hope found throughout Isaiah, where God's people will experience ultimate redemption. The "day" signifies a time of divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>Give praise to the LORD;</b><br>Praising the LORD is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing gratitude and worship. This call to praise reflects the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and goodness. It echoes the Psalms, where praise is a response to God's mighty acts and character (e.g., <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>).<p><b>proclaim His name!</b><br>Proclaiming God's name involves declaring His character and deeds. In ancient Israel, a name represented one's essence and reputation. This proclamation is a call to evangelism, sharing the knowledge of God with others, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>Make His works known among the peoples;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of testifying to God's actions, not just within Israel but to all nations. It reflects the universal scope of God's salvation plan, as seen in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) and the prophetic vision of all nations worshiping God (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>).<p><b>declare that His name is exalted.</b><br>Exalting God's name means recognizing His supreme authority and holiness. This declaration is an act of worship and acknowledgment of God's rightful place above all creation. It aligns with the New Testament teaching that every knee will bow to Jesus Christ, who embodies God's name (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Yahweh is the covenant God of Israel, deserving of praise and proclamation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The intended audience of Isaiah's prophecy, called to worship and declare God's deeds.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations (Peoples)</a></b><br>The broader audience who are to hear of God's works through the testimony of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message, encouraging the people to respond to God's salvation with praise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_salvation.htm">The Day of Salvation</a></b><br>A prophetic time when God's deliverance and salvation are fully realized, prompting this response of praise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_as_a_response_to_salvation.htm">Praise as a Response to Salvation</a></b><br>Recognize that true praise flows from a heart that has experienced God's salvation.
