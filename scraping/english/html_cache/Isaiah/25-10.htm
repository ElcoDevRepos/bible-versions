The "hand of the LORD" symbolizes divine power and blessing, indicating a period of peace and security for God's people. This imagery connects to <a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>, where the root of Jesse stands as a banner for the peoples, and the nations will rally to him, and his resting place will be glorious. The mountain is a recurring biblical motif for God's dwelling place, as seen in <a href="/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>, which describes Mount Zion as the city of the Great King. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>, where the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, and God dwells with His people.<p><b>But Moab will be trampled in his place</b><br>Moab, a nation east of Israel, often symbolizes opposition to God's people. Historically, Moab had a tumultuous relationship with Israel, sometimes allying with them but often opposing them, as seen in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a> with Balaam's curse. The imagery of being "trampled" suggests complete defeat and humiliation, reflecting God's judgment against those who oppose His will. This judgment is consistent with other prophetic declarations against Moab, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a> and <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>. Theologically, Moab's downfall serves as a warning against pride and self-reliance, contrasting with the security found in God's presence on His mountain.<p><b>as straw is trodden into the dung pile.</b><br>This vivid imagery emphasizes the totality and disgrace of Moab's defeat. Straw, a byproduct of the harvest, is often associated with worthlessness and is easily destroyed, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, where the wicked are compared to chaff blown away by the wind. The "dung pile" further underscores the degradation and impurity of Moab's fate, as dung was considered unclean and a symbol of waste. This metaphor highlights the futility of opposing God's purposes and serves as a stark contrast to the honor and blessing of those who dwell on God's mountain. The imagery also echoes the fate of the wicked in <a href="/malachi/4-3.htm">Malachi 4:3</a>, where they are trampled underfoot like ashes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, whose hand signifies power, protection, and judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/this_mountain.htm">This Mountain</a></b><br>Refers to Mount Zion, symbolizing God's presence and the place of His kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation historically opposed to Israel, representing those who are against God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/straw.htm">Straw</a></b><br>Symbolizes something of little value, easily destroyed or trampled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dung_pit.htm">Dung Pit</a></b><br>A place of waste, symbolizing humiliation and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God's hand resting on the mountain signifies His sovereign rule and protection over His people.

The inscription of the Moabite stone, in connection with Isaiah 15, helps to explain the nature of the allusion. Moab had been prominent among the enemies of Israel; the claims of Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been set up against those of Jehovah, the God of Israel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 166), and so the name had become representative of His enemies. There was a mystical Moab, as there was afterwards a mystical Babylon, and in Rabbinic writings a mystical Edom (i.e., Rome). The proud nation was to lie wallowing in the mire of shame, trampled on by its s on the threshing-floor is trampled by the oxen till it looks like a heap of dung. In the Hebrew word for "dunghill" (<span class= "ital">madm?nah</span>) we may probably trace a reference to the Moabite city of that name (<a href="/jeremiah/48-2.htm" title="There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue you.">Jeremiah 48:2</a>), in which Isaiah sees an unconscious prophecy of the future condition of the whole nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest</span>. The protecting hand of God will ever be stretched out over the spiritual Zion - the Church of the Redeemed - to defend it and keep it safe throughout eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Moab shall be trodden down</span>. Various reasons have been given for the selection of Moab to represent the enemies of the redeemed. Perhaps, as the Moabites were, on the whole, the bitterest of all the adversaries of the Jews (see <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>), they are regarded as the fittest representatives of the human adversaries of God. <span class="cmt_word">For the dung-hill</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the water of a dung-pit</span>.
