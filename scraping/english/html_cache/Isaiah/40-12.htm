The imagery of measuring the vast waters of the earth in the hollow of one's hand highlights the infinite power and wisdom of God. In biblical context, water often symbolizes chaos and the unknown, yet God is portrayed as having complete control over it. This echoes <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God hovers over the waters, bringing order from chaos. The hollow of the hand suggests intimacy and care, indicating God's personal involvement in creation.<p><b>or marked off the heavens with the span of his hand?</b><br>The heavens, representing the sky and the universe, are depicted as being measured by God with the span of His hand, illustrating His immense power and authority. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the heavens as a vast, immeasurable expanse, yet God is portrayed as having mastery over it. The span, a unit of measurement from the thumb to the little finger, signifies precision and control. This connects to <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God, and to <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38</a>, where God questions Job about the creation of the world, underscoring His unmatched wisdom and power.<p><b>Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket</b><br>The dust of the earth symbolizes humanity and mortality, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust. Holding the dust in a basket suggests God's ability to contain and manage the entirety of creation. This imagery conveys God's intimate knowledge and care for the earth and its inhabitants. The basket, a common tool in ancient times for carrying goods, implies God's provision and sustenance for His creation.<p><b>or weighed the mountains on a scale and the hills with a balance?</b><br>Weighing the mountains and hills signifies God's supreme authority and precision in creation. Mountains often represent strength and stability in scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/125-2.htm">Psalm 125:2</a>, where the mountains surround Jerusalem, symbolizing God's protection. The use of a scale and balance indicates fairness and justice, attributes of God's character. This imagery connects to <a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>, where honest scales and balances are the Lord's, highlighting His righteousness and integrity. The phrase underscores God's meticulous care and governance over the natural world, affirming His role as the ultimate Creator and Sustainer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.

Each image shrinks creation to a manageable object in God&#8217;s hand, basket, or scale, reminding God&#8217;s people that no force, need, or threat is outside His precise governance. In the context of comfort to exiled Judah and to all who trust Him today, the verse invites a response of awe-filled faith: the God who handles the universe with such ease surely holds His children securely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Who hath measured . . .</span>?--Another section opens, expanding the thought of the eternal majesty of Jehovah, as contrasted with the vanity of the idols, or "no-gods," of the heathen.

If captive Israel is to be induced to turn' to God, and so hasten the time of its restoration to his favour and to its own land, it must be by rising to a worthy conception of the nature and attributes of the Almighty. The prophet, therefore, in the remainder of this chapter, paints in glorious language the power and greatness, and at the same time the mercy, of God, contrasting him with man (vers. 15-17, 23, 28-31), with idols (vers. 19, 20), and with the framework of material things (vers. 21, 22, 26), and showing his infinite superiority to each and all. In contrasting him with man, he takes occasion to bring into prominence his goodness and loving-kindness to man, to whom he imparts a portion of his own might and strength (vers. 29-31 ). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath measured the waters?</span> (comp. <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a> and <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>). The might of God is especially shown in creation, which Isaiah assumes to be God's work. How infinitely above man must he be, who arranged in such perfection, "by measure and number and weight" (Wisd. 11:20), the earth, the waters, and the heavens, so proportioning each to each as to produce that admirable order and regularity which the intelligent observer cannot but note in the material universe as among its chief characteristics! <span class="cmt_word">In the hollow of his hand</span>. The anthropomorphism is strong, no doubt, but softened by the preceding mention (in ver. 10) of God's "arm," and by the comparison of God to a shepherd (in ver. 11). Isaiah's exalted notion of God renders him fearless with regard to anthropomorphism<span class="cmt_word">. And meted out heaven with the span</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with a span</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a>, "My right hand hath <span class="accented">spanned</span> the heavens"). <span class="cmt_word">And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in a tierce</span> (as in the margin). The measure intended is probably the <span class="accented">seah</span>, which was the third part of an <span class="accented">ephah</span>, and held about three gallons. The <span class="accented">seah</span> was "the ordinary measure for household purposes." <span class="cmt_word">In scales... in a balance</span>. The <span class="accented">peles</span>, here translated "scales," is probably the steelyard, while the <span class="accented">mozenaim</span> is "the balance" or "pair of scales" ordinarily used for weighing.
