Historically, this reflects the period of the Babylonian exile when the Israelites were taken captive and their land was ravaged. Theologically, it signifies the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God, as outlined in the covenant curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The imagery of being plundered and looted also serves as a metaphor for spiritual desolation due to sin.<p><b>all trapped in caves or imprisoned in dungeons</b><br>This imagery suggests a state of utter helplessness and confinement. Caves and dungeons symbolize places of darkness and despair, reflecting the Israelites' captivity and loss of freedom. In a broader spiritual sense, it can represent the bondage of sin and the human condition without divine intervention. The use of such imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe captivity and oppression, such as <a href="/lamentations/3-6.htm">Lamentations 3:6-7</a>.<p><b>They have become plunder with no one to rescue them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the absence of a deliverer or savior for the Israelites in their time of distress. Historically, it underscores the period when Israel had no king or leader to defend them against their enemies. Theologically, it points to the need for divine intervention, foreshadowing the coming of the Messiah, who is prophesied to be the ultimate rescuer and redeemer. This connects to passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who will bring salvation.<p><b>and loot with no one to say, &#8220;Send them back!&#8221;</b><br>The lack of an advocate or intercessor highlights the Israelites' vulnerability and the severity of their situation. In the cultural context, captives and loot were often taken as spoils of war, and without a powerful ally, there was little hope of return. This phrase can also be seen as a call for justice and restoration, themes that are prevalent throughout the prophetic books. It anticipates the role of Christ as the one who will ultimately restore and redeem His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>, where Jesus declares His mission to set the captives free.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The primary focus of this verse is the nation of Israel, who are described as being plundered and looted.

This can be seen as a consequence of their turning away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The author of this book, Isaiah, is delivering God's message to the people of Israel.

The verse is not merely historical commentary; it is a mirror showing what sin does to any heart&#8212;robbing, imprisoning, isolating. Yet the surrounding chapters reveal a God who refuses to leave His people in that condition. When no one else speaks up, He does; when no one else rescues, He does&#8212;ultimately through the Servant, Jesus Christ, who frees captives and restores what was lost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">But this is a people robbed and spoiled . . .</span>--It is hard to say whether the prophet contemplates the state of the exiles in Babylon, or sees far off yet another exile, consequent on a second and more fatal falling off from the true ideal.<p><span class= "bld">None delivereth . . .</span> <span class= "bld">none saith, Restore.</span>--The tone of despondency seems to come in strangely after the glorious promise of deliverance. On the whole, therefore, the second view seems the more probable; and, so taken, the verse finds its best commentary in Romans 9-11, which is permeated through and through with the thoughts of 2 Isaiah.
