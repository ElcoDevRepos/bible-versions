The fall of Assyria is significant as it demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to bring down even the most formidable empires. Historically, Assyria's decline began with internal strife and was completed by the rise of the Babylonian and Median empires, culminating in the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC.<p><b>but not by the sword of man</b><br>This indicates that Assyria's fall will not be due to human military intervention alone. It suggests divine intervention, emphasizing that God Himself will orchestrate their downfall. This aligns with the biblical theme that God often uses supernatural means to achieve His purposes, as seen in other instances like the defeat of the Midianites by Gideon (Judges 7) and the destruction of Sennacherib's army (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>).<p><b>a sword will devour them, but not one made by mortals</b><br>The "sword" here symbolizes God's judgment and power, not a literal weapon. This reflects the biblical motif of God fighting for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where God promises to fight for Israel. The phrase underscores the futility of relying on human strength and the ultimate authority of God over all creation.<p><b>They will flee before the sword</b><br>This suggests a panic and retreat among the Assyrian forces, reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God causes confusion and fear among enemy armies (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>). It highlights the theme of divine retribution and the fulfillment of God's promises to protect His people.<p><b>and their young men will be put to forced labor</b><br>This outcome reflects the common practice in ancient times where defeated peoples were often subjected to servitude. It serves as a reversal of fortunes for the Assyrians, who had previously enslaved others. This phrase also echoes the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>), as Assyria's own oppressive practices are turned back upon them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrian.htm">The Assyrian</a></b><br>Represents the Assyrian Empire, a dominant power during Isaiah's time, known for its military might and oppression of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword_not_of_man.htm">Sword Not of Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes divine intervention, indicating that the downfall of the Assyrian will be by God's power, not human effort.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_men.htm">Young Men</a></b><br>Refers to the Assyrian soldiers or young warriors who will be captured and subjected to forced labor, highlighting the complete defeat of the Assyrian forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty.htm">Divine Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's power is supreme over all earthly powers.
