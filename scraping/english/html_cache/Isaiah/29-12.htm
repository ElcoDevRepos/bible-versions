In the context of Isaiah, this reflects the spiritual blindness and ignorance prevalent among the people of Judah. The scroll symbolizes God's revelation, which remains inaccessible to those who lack spiritual insight. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the importance of spiritual discernment, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.<p><b>he will say, &#8220;I cannot read.&#8221;</b><br>This response underscores the helplessness and lack of understanding among those who are spiritually blind. It reflects a broader cultural context where literacy was not widespread, and many relied on scribes or religious leaders to interpret texts. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the rejection of God's message, similar to how Jesus spoke in parables to those who were not open to understanding (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).

He has just described the educated man (v. 11) who refuses the sealed scroll; now He turns to the uneducated. God&#8217;s Word confronts everyone&#8212;whether scholar or simple laborer&#8212;with equal authority, just as <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a> underlines that &#8220;there is no distinction.&#8221; The shift prepares us to see that ignorance is no excuse, echoing <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a> where God &#8220;now commands all people everywhere to repent.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if the scroll is handed to one unable to read</b><p>The &#8220;scroll&#8221; represents divine revelation. Handing it directly to the illiterate person proves that the issue is not the availability of God&#8217;s truth but the readiness of the heart to receive it. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a> reminds Israel that the word is &#8220;very near you,&#8221; and <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> says Christ &#8220;gives light to every man.&#8221; God ensures His message reaches all levels of society; refusal comes from within, not from a lack of opportunity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will say</b><p>The response is personal and voluntary. No coercion prevents him from trying; he simply reacts. This mirrors Israel&#8217;s historical pattern of declining God&#8217;s invitations (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). Jesus later laments the same attitude in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>: &#8220;how often I have longed to gather your children together&#8230;and you were unwilling.&#8221; The phrase underlines accountability&#8212;each individual must answer for how he handles revealed truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I cannot read.&#8221;</b><p>The man&#8217;s confession sounds honest, yet it masks complacency. Rather than seeking help, he opts for resignation, much like the five foolish virgins in <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a> who failed to prepare. <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> promises that the Messiah will open blind eyes and loosen mute tongues; refusal to seek that help leaves one voluntarily in darkness. Spiritually, this illustrates hearts that prefer ignorance over transformation (cf. <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). God&#8217;s Word remains clear, but a willful lack of engagement turns ability into inability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-12.htm">Isaiah 29:12</a> portrays the uneducated man refusing to engage God&#8217;s revealed Word, illustrating that spiritual blindness is rooted in the heart, not in intellect or opportunity. Whether a scroll is sealed or a reader is illiterate, the result is the same when the will resists God. The verse calls every believer to humble, active pursuit of Scripture, trusting the Lord who makes His truth accessible and expecting Him to open our eyes when we come willing to learn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that is not learned</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that cannot read writing."
