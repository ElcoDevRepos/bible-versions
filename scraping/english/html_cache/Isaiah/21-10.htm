In ancient Israel, threshing floors were often located on elevated, windy sites to facilitate the separation process. The "crushed" people likely refer to the Israelites experiencing oppression or judgment, possibly due to their disobedience or the consequences of foreign invasion. The threshing floor is a recurring biblical metaphor for judgment (e.g., <a href="/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>), indicating a time of testing and refinement. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation at the end of times.<p><b>I tell you what I have heard</b><br>The prophet Isaiah serves as a mouthpiece for divine revelation, emphasizing the role of prophets in conveying God's messages to His people. This phrase underscores the importance of prophetic authority and the responsibility of the prophet to faithfully communicate God's word. It also highlights the intimate relationship between the prophet and God, where the prophet receives divine insight and is tasked with sharing it with the people.<p><b>from the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" (Yahweh Sabaoth) reflects God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies and all creation. It emphasizes His power, authority, and ability to execute judgment and deliverance. This title is frequently used in the context of divine intervention and warfare, underscoring God's role as a divine warrior who fights on behalf of His people (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>, <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>). It reassures the Israelites of God's ultimate control over the nations and their circumstances.<p><b>the God of Israel</b><br>This designation reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting His faithfulness and commitment to His chosen people. It serves as a reminder of the promises made to the patriarchs and the unique identity of Israel as God's people. This phrase also distinguishes the God of Israel from the pagan deities of surrounding nations, emphasizing monotheism and the exclusivity of worship due to Yahweh alone. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan through Israel, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the true Israel and the embodiment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is delivering the message from God.
