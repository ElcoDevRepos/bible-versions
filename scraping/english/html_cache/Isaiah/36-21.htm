In the context of ancient Israel, silence in the face of provocation was a demonstration of trust in leadership and, by extension, trust in God. The people&#8217;s silence can be seen as an act of faith, reflecting the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>, which suggests that even a fool is considered wise when he holds his peace.<p><b>and did not answer a word</b><br>The refusal to respond to the Assyrian envoy's taunts and threats is significant. It contrasts with the typical human reaction to defend oneself verbally. This restraint can be seen as a form of spiritual discipline, aligning with the biblical principle of letting God fight one's battles, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where Moses tells the Israelites, "The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."<p><b>for Hezekiah had commanded</b><br>King Hezekiah's leadership is underscored here. His command reflects his reliance on divine guidance rather than human wisdom. Hezekiah is portrayed as a king who seeks the Lord, as evidenced by his actions throughout his reign (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>). His command to remain silent is a strategic decision, showing his understanding of the power of words and the potential for escalation.<p><b>&#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221;</b><br>This directive from Hezekiah is a strategic move to avoid engaging with the enemy on their terms. It reflects a broader biblical theme of choosing one's battles wisely and relying on God for deliverance. This echoes the advice found in <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4-5</a> about not answering a fool according to his folly. It also prefigures the silence of Jesus before His accusers (<a href="/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>), demonstrating a profound trust in God's ultimate justice and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian invasion.
