Historically, Egypt was known for its internal divisions, especially during periods of weak central authority. This prophecy could be seen as a reflection of the political instability that plagued Egypt during various dynasties. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His control over peace and calamity. This internal conflict can also be seen as a judgment against Egypt for its idolatry and oppression of Israel, reminiscent of the plagues in Exodus.<p><b>brother will fight against brother,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the depth of the civil strife, suggesting that familial bonds will be broken. It echoes the theme of division found in other biblical narratives, such as the story of Cain and Abel in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4</a>. The breakdown of family unity is often portrayed in the Bible as a sign of moral and spiritual decay. This internal conflict can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual disunity that occurs when a nation turns away from God.<p><b>neighbor against neighbor,</b><br>The conflict extends beyond family to the broader community, indicating widespread social chaos. This mirrors the social disintegration described in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, where trust between neighbors is eroded. In the ancient Near East, community ties were crucial for survival, and their breakdown would lead to significant societal collapse. This serves as a warning of the consequences of abandoning divine principles.<p><b>city against city,</b><br>The mention of cities suggests a larger scale of conflict, possibly indicating political or economic rivalries. In ancient Egypt, cities often had their own local deities and political interests, which could lead to competition and conflict. This phrase may also allude to the historical periods of division in Egypt, such as the First and Second Intermediate Periods, when central authority was weak, and regional powers vied for control. It highlights the instability that can arise when a nation is divided against itself.<p><b>and kingdom against kingdom.</b><br>This escalation to kingdoms suggests a national or even international level of conflict. In the context of Isaiah's prophecy, it could refer to the various regions of Egypt, such as Upper and Lower Egypt, which were historically known to be in conflict. It also foreshadows the broader conflicts that would arise in the ancient world, as seen in the rise and fall of empires like Assyria and Babylon. This phrase can be connected to Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a>, where He speaks of wars and rumors of wars as signs of the end times, indicating that such conflicts are part of the broader narrative of human history under divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Egypt, a significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother_against_brother.htm">Brother against Brother</a></b><br>This phrase indicates internal conflict and civil strife within a nation or community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor_against_neighbor.htm">Neighbor against Neighbor</a></b><br>Suggests a breakdown of societal harmony and trust, leading to widespread discord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_against_city.htm">City against City</a></b><br>Represents division and conflict on a larger scale, affecting entire communities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_against_kingdom.htm">Kingdom against Kingdom</a></b><br>Implies political and national turmoil, possibly leading to war and instability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">Divine Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and can use internal conflict as a form of judgment.<br><br>Reflect on how God&#8217;s sovereignty is evident in the affairs of nations today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin_and_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Sin and Idolatry</a></b><br>Internal strife often results from turning away from God and embracing idolatry.<br><br>Consider how personal and national sins can lead to division and chaos.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_unity_and_peace.htm">The Importance of Unity and Peace</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be peacemakers and to strive for unity within our communities.<br><br>Evaluate how you can promote peace and unity in your own relationships and community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warnings_and_signs_of_the_times.htm">Warnings and Signs of the Times</a></b><br>The prophecy serves as a warning of the consequences of ignoring God&#8217;s commands.<br><br>Be vigilant and discerning of the times, understanding the spiritual implications of current events.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_19_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 19:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_19_2_God_s_control_in_conflicts.htm">How does Isaiah 19:2 illustrate God's sovereignty over national conflicts today?

Just as He &#8220;stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>) or &#8220;sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem&#8221; (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>), He now moves within Egypt.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment often takes the form of letting sin run its course; here He unleashes the nation&#8217;s own ambitions and suspicions. Compare <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>, where He judged Egypt&#8217;s gods, and <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>, where He wields Assyria &#8220;to seize the spoil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Historically, soon after Isaiah spoke, Egypt experienced repeated civil wars&#8212;lower against upper Egypt, Memphis against Sais, Delta princes vying for the throne&#8212;confirming the prophecy&#8217;s literal accuracy.

These are the beginning of birth pains&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-8.htm">Mark 13:8</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s picture of urban chaos forms an Old Testament backdrop to that warning.<p>&#8226; Historically, Memphis, Tanis, and Thebes alternated between uneasy truces and open hostility, draining Egypt&#8217;s strength before foreign invaders arrived.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kingdom against kingdom</b><p>&#8226; The spiral reaches a national scale: petty realms inside Egypt, then Egypt versus surrounding powers. <a href="/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a> immediately speaks of &#8220;a fierce king&#8221; ruling over them&#8212;fulfilled when Assyria installed puppet dynasties.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/15-6.htm">2 Chronicles 15:6</a> notes a similar pattern: &#8220;Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every kind of distress.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus copies Isaiah&#8217;s very phrase in <a href="/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7</a> and <a href="/luke/21-10.htm">Luke 21:10</a>, signaling that such convulsions will mark the climax of history before His return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a> presents a divinely initiated cascade of chaos&#8212;family, local, civic, and national bonds all shattering under God&#8217;s righteous judgment. The prophecy came to pass in Egypt&#8217;s civil wars and foreign subjugations, validating Scripture&#8217;s literal accuracy. It also offers a timeless warning: when a people turns from the Lord, discord multiplies from the living room to the throne room, yet God remains sovereign over every upheaval, steering history toward His ultimate redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians . . .</span>--The discord predicted was probably the natural consequence of the overthrow of the Ethiopian power by Sargon, the Assyrian king, in B.C. 720. Under Piankhi each <span class= "ital">nome, </span>or district, had been governed by a chief, owning the suzerainty of the Ethiopian king, and these, when the restraint was removed, would naturally assert their independence. So Herodotus (ii. 147) relates that on the overthrow of Sabaco, the last of the Ethiopian dynasty, the unity of Egypt was broken up into a dodecarchy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians.</span> The disintegration of Egypt commenced about <span class="date">B.C. 760-750</span>, towards the close of the twenty-second dynasty.

Ten or twelve years later there was a struggle between Bocchoris and Sabaeo. From this time onwards, until Psamatik I. reestablished the unity of Egypt (about <span class="date">B.C. 650</span>), the country was always more or less divided, and on the occurrence of any crisis the princes were apt to make war one up, n another. <span class="cmt_word">Kingdom against kingdom.</span> During the period of disintegration, the title of" king" was assumed by most of the potty princes, though they were little more than chiefs of cities (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. p. 100; G.
