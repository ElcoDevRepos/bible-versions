This is consistent with other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>, which speaks of God's intimate knowledge of human thoughts. The context here is a reminder of God's judgment and justice, as He is aware of both the righteous and unrighteous deeds of humanity. This knowledge is not limited to Israel but extends to all people, reflecting the universal scope of God's sovereignty.<p><b>am coming to gather all nations and tongues</b><br>This prophecy points to a future event where God will bring together people from every nation and language. It echoes the promise made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where all families of the earth would be blessed through him. This gathering is also seen in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne of God. The phrase suggests a reversal of the division seen at the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11), where languages were confused and nations scattered.<p><b>and they will come and see My glory</b><br>The promise of seeing God's glory is a central theme in biblical prophecy, often associated with the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom. In the Old Testament, God's glory was revealed in the tabernacle and the temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is the ultimate revelation of God's glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This phrase anticipates a time when God's presence will be fully revealed to all humanity, fulfilling the hope of the prophets and the longing of the faithful. The vision of God's glory is both a promise of hope and a call to worship, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and omnipotent being who knows the works and thoughts of all people. He is the central figure in this verse, orchestrating the gathering of nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_tongues.htm">Nations and Tongues</a></b><br>Refers to the diverse peoples and languages of the world. This highlights the inclusivity of God's plan for all humanity to witness His glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gathering.htm">The Gathering</a></b><br>An eschatological event where God will bring together all nations to reveal His glory. This gathering signifies a future time of divine revelation and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/glory_of_god.htm">Glory of God</a></b><br>The manifestation of God's presence and majesty, which will be revealed to all nations. This is a central theme in the prophetic vision of Isaiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message. Isaiah's role is to communicate God's plans and purposes to the people of Israel and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Omniscience and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God knows the works and thoughts of every individual, emphasizing His complete understanding and control over creation.

This encourages us to embrace diversity within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eschatological_hope.htm">Eschatological Hope</a></b><br>The promise of seeing God's glory provides hope for the future.
