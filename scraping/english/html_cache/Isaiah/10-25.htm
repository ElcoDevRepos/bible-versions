In the context of Isaiah, God often uses time-bound language to assure His people that His wrath is not permanent. This reflects God's patience and mercy, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, which states that His anger lasts only a moment. Historically, this period refers to the Assyrian threat, which was a real and present danger to Israel and Judah during Isaiah's time.<p><b>My fury against you will subside</b><br>Here, "fury" refers to God's righteous anger towards Israel due to their disobedience and idolatry. The subsiding of God's fury signifies a restoration of His favor. This is consistent with the covenant relationship where God disciplines His people but also promises restoration, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-3</a>. Theologically, it underscores the concept of divine discipline as a means to bring about repentance and renewal.<p><b>and My anger will turn to their destruction.&#8221;</b><br>The "anger" of God shifting to "their destruction" refers to the Assyrians, who were used as instruments of judgment against Israel but would themselves face judgment for their pride and cruelty. This reflects the biblical principle that God holds all nations accountable, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate justice of God, where evil will be punished, aligning with the eschatological themes found in Revelation. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, where He will judge the nations and establish His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

God&#8217;s timeline may test patience, but He guarantees it is short compared with His long-range plan of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My fury against you will subside</b><p>&#8226; God had disciplined Judah because of persistent sin (<a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>). Yet His anger is parental, not punitive in the ultimate sense.<p>&#8226; &#8220;His anger is but for a moment; His favor is for a lifetime&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). The same heartbeat is heard in <a href="/isaiah/12-1.htm">Isaiah 12:1</a>: &#8220;Though You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse assures that divine correction has an endpoint. Like a father who withholds discipline once it has achieved its purpose (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>), the Lord&#8217;s indignation lifts when hearts are humbled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and My anger will turn to their destruction</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;their&#8221; points to Assyria, the empire God employed as a rod but now judges for its arrogance (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift of wrath reveals God&#8217;s justice: He defends His covenant people and holds oppressors accountable. Compare His promise, &#8220;I will break the Assyrian in My land&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-25</a>) and His word concerning Babylon, &#8220;Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more&#8221; (<a href="/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; History records Assyria&#8217;s swift decline after its zenith&#8212;an exact match to God&#8217;s forecast. As with Egypt at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-31</a>), the Lord turns the tables, proving He alone is sovereign over nations (<a href="/jeremiah/50-34.htm">Jeremiah 50:34</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the pattern stands: discipline serves to refine us; judgment falls on unrepentant adversaries (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a> packs three assurances: the trial will be brief, God&#8217;s corrective anger toward His people will end, and ultimate destruction awaits ruthless oppressors.
