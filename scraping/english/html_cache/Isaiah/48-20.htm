Babylon, a symbol of oppression and idolatry, represents the world system opposed to God. The call to leave signifies a physical and spiritual departure from sin and bondage, echoing God's deliverance of His people from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31</a>). It foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who calls believers to separate from worldly influences (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><b>Flee from the Chaldeans!</b><br>The Chaldeans were the ruling class in Babylon, known for their wisdom and astrology. Fleeing from them implies urgency and a complete break from their influence. This mirrors the call to flee from sin and false teachings (<a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>). Historically, it points to the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians, fulfilling God's judgment (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30-31</a>).<p><b>Declare it with a shout of joy,</b><br>The joyful proclamation signifies the good news of deliverance and redemption. In biblical times, shouting was a common expression of victory and celebration (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>). This anticipates the joy of salvation found in Christ, who brings freedom from sin (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>).<p><b>proclaim it,</b><br>Proclaiming emphasizes the importance of sharing God's acts of salvation. It reflects the prophetic role of Israel to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). In the New Testament, believers are called to proclaim the gospel to all creation (<a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>).<p><b>let it go out to the ends of the earth,</b><br>This phrase underscores the universal scope of God's salvation plan. It connects to the Abrahamic covenant, where all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It prefigures the Great Commission, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8220;The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!&#8221;</b><br>Redemption here refers to God's act of liberating Israel from captivity, a type of the greater redemption through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). "Jacob" symbolizes the nation of Israel, chosen and loved by God despite their failings. This redemption is a testament to God's faithfulness and mercy, pointing to the ultimate redemption of humanity through Jesus (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant city and empire in ancient Mesopotamia, often symbolizing oppression and idolatry in the Bible.

A sudden transition from expostulation to exhortation. It might have seemed that no exhortation would be needed; that, as soon as the prison-doors were set open, there would be a general rush to escape. But, when the time came, it was not so. Those only availed themselves of the edict of Cyrus "whose spirit God had raised to go up and build his house" (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>). The wealthier classes, Josephus tells us ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1), remained. The very poor, it is probable, <span class="accented">could</span> not leave. Motives of various kinds detained others. The result was that probably a larger number elected to continue in the country than to return to Palestine. Hence the exhortation to "go forth from Babylon and flee from the Chaldeans" was far from being superfluous. <span class="cmt_word">Flee ye from the Chaldeans</span>. Not "flee before them" (see <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>), as enemies to be feared; but quit them hastily, as corrupters to be avoided.
