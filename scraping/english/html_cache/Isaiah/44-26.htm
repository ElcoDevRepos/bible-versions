In the context of Isaiah, the "servant" often refers to the prophets, including Isaiah himself, who conveyed God's messages to the people. This assurance of confirmation is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God consistently fulfills the prophecies given through His chosen messengers. The role of the servant can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Servant of the Lord, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and fulfills the counsel of His messengers</b><br>The "messengers" are the prophets who delivered God's counsel to Israel. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to bring to pass what He has decreed through His prophets. Historically, the fulfillment of prophetic counsel is evident in events such as the return from Babylonian exile, which Isaiah prophesied. This also points to the reliability of God's word, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies.<p><b>who says of Jerusalem, &#8216;She will be inhabited,&#8217;</b><br>At the time of Isaiah's prophecy, Jerusalem faced destruction and desolation due to impending judgment. However, God promises restoration, affirming that Jerusalem will once again be a thriving city. This prophecy was fulfilled when the exiles returned under leaders like Zerubbabel and Nehemiah. Jerusalem's restoration is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing spiritual renewal and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom.<p><b>and of the cities of Judah, &#8216;They will be rebuilt,</b><br>The cities of Judah, like Jerusalem, were devastated by the Babylonian conquest. God's promise to rebuild them signifies hope and renewal for the nation. This rebuilding is not only physical but also spiritual, as the people are called to return to God. The rebuilding of Judah's cities foreshadows the spiritual restoration found in Christ, who rebuilds lives and communities through His redemptive work.<p><b>and I will restore their ruins,&#8217;</b><br>The restoration of ruins signifies God's power to bring life and order out of chaos and destruction. This promise of restoration is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the rebuilding efforts led by figures like Ezra and Nehemiah. It also points to the ultimate restoration through Christ, who restores humanity's broken relationship with God. The imagery of ruins being restored is a powerful testament to God's redemptive purposes throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Isaiah, called &#8220;My servant&#8221; earlier (<a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>), stood before Judah proclaiming both judgment and hope. Here the LORD promises to &#8220;confirm&#8221; (establish, make firm) Isaiah&#8217;s announcements. The pattern is consistent throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Not one word has failed of all His good promises&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;So is My word that goes out from My mouth: it will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, &#8220;every one of God&#8217;s promises is &#8216;Yes&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>When God backs His servant, the hearer can anchor faith to the certainty of divine accomplishment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And fulfills the counsel of His messengers</b><p>The plural &#8220;messengers&#8221; widens the circle to the prophets who echoed Isaiah&#8217;s theme: Jeremiah foretold seventy years of exile and a return (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>; 29:10), while Daniel later &#8220;understood by the books&#8221; that God would do exactly that (<a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>). The LORD &#8220;fulfills&#8221; their counsel, demonstrating that prophetic agreement is no coincidence but the product of one Author. <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a> calls this combination of promise and oath &#8220;two unchangeable things,&#8221; guaranteeing that hope in His word is never misplaced.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who says of Jerusalem, &#8216;She will be inhabited&#8217;</b><p>When Isaiah wrote, Jerusalem still bustled with life; yet within a century Babylon would reduce it to ashes (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>). God speaks beyond the impending catastrophe to a future restoration:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Break forth together into joyful singing, O ruins of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted His people&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/52-9.htm">Isaiah 52:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Thus says the LORD: &#8216;I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>).<p>History records the fulfillment: Cyrus issued a decree in 538 BC releasing the Jews (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22-23</a>; <a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>), and returning exiles once again &#8220;settled in their towns&#8221; (<a href="/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>). God&#8217;s foreknowledge is not guesswork; it is sovereign certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And of the cities of Judah, &#8216;They will be rebuilt&#8217;</b><p>The promise extends beyond the capital to every devastated village: Lachish, Hebron, Beth-shemesh, and more. The breadth underscores God&#8217;s comprehensive care. Isaiah later announces, &#8220;They will rebuild the ancient ruins; they will restore the places long devastated&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>). Amos echoes, &#8220;I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel, and they will rebuild and occupy ruined cities&#8221; (<a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>). Under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, this pledge became visible reality as walls rose and homes re-emerged (<a href="/nehemiah/7-4.htm">Nehemiah 7:4</a>; 12:27).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will restore their ruins</b><p>The LORD Himself takes ownership: &#8220;I will restore.&#8221; What sin and invasion wreck, divine mercy renews.

The physical rebuilding of Judah previews the ultimate renewal in Christ, culminating in the New Jerusalem where &#8220;He who sits on the throne says, &#8216;Behold, I make all things new&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a> showcases God&#8217;s unfailing commitment to His word. He validates His servant, brings to pass the united counsel of His prophets, and speaks life over what looks hopeless. Jerusalem&#8217;s rubble became a thriving city again because the LORD decreed it. That same faithfulness assures us today: every promise He has spoken&#8212;whether about forgiveness, future glory, or daily provision&#8212;stands as solid as the rebuilt walls of Zion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">That confirmeth the word of his servant.</span>--The parallelism of "servant<span class= "ital">" </span>in the singular with "messengers" in the plural suggests the thought that the prophet is not speaking of himself, but of Israel, as the ideal "servant of the Lord," the prophetic nation represented by the individual "messengers" or prophets.
