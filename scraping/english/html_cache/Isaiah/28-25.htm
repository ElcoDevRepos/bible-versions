The leveling of the surface ensures that the soil is ready to receive seeds, symbolizing the importance of preparation and order in God's creation. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual readiness and the need for a firm foundation, as echoed in passages like <a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3-9</a>, where Jesus speaks of the parable of the sower.<p><b>does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin?</b><br>Caraway and cumin are spices that were commonly cultivated in the ancient Near East. Their mention here highlights the diversity and specificity of God's provision and the care taken in planting different crops according to their needs. This reflects the wisdom and intentionality in God's design, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-6</a>, where Paul speaks of the variety of gifts given by the same Spirit.<p><b>He plants wheat in rows</b><br>Wheat was a staple crop in ancient Israel, essential for making bread, a basic food item. Planting in rows suggests an orderly and systematic approach, emphasizing the importance of discipline and structure in life. This can be related to the orderly nature of God's law and commandments, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path.<p><b>and barley in plots</b><br>Barley was another important grain, often used for making bread and beer. It was typically planted in plots, indicating a methodical approach to agriculture. Barley is also significant in biblical narratives, such as in the story of Ruth, where it symbolizes provision and sustenance. This reflects God's provision for His people, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where God promises to supply every need.<p><b>and rye within its border</b><br>Rye, though less common, was also cultivated and used for various purposes. Planting rye within its border suggests careful planning and boundary-setting, which can be seen as a metaphor for maintaining spiritual boundaries and integrity.

Identification in such cases is not always easy; but I follow Mr. Carruthers (<span class= "ital">Bible Educator, </span>i. 38) in reading "fennel seed" for the "fitches" of the English version. This, proverbially among the smallest of seeds, so as to be a type of the microscopic unseen, was scattered broadcast; "cummin," also proverbial for its smallness, was sown by a like process, with some technical variation, indicated by the use of the Hebrew words. Wheat and barley were "dropped in" more deliberately by the hand of the sower, and then (instead of "the rie in their place"), <span class= "ital">"vetches for the borders thereof," </span>these being used in the East as a kind of herbaceous hedge round the field of corn. The point of the enumeration is that the wise tiller of the soil is discriminating in his methods, and deals with each seed according to its nature. So is it, the prophet suggests through the parable which he does not interpret, with the great Husbandman, whose field is the world, and for whom the nations are as seed.
