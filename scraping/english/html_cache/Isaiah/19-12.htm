In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), and the question implies that true wisdom is lacking among Egypt's advisors. This echoes the futility of human wisdom when it stands against God's plans, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>, where the wisdom of the world is contrasted with the wisdom of God.<p><b>Let them tell you</b><br>This part of the verse invites the wise men to demonstrate their understanding and foresight. It is a rhetorical challenge, highlighting their inability to predict or comprehend the divine will. This mirrors the story of Daniel, where Babylonian wise men failed to interpret King Nebuchadnezzar's dream, but Daniel, through God's revelation, succeeded (<a href="/daniel/2-27.htm">Daniel 2:27-28</a>).<p><b>and reveal what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over all heavenly and earthly armies. The phrase underscores the futility of opposing God's decrees. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, often seen as a symbol of human strength and pride. However, the prophecy indicates that God's plans will prevail over Egypt's might. This is consistent with other prophecies where God declares His intentions against nations, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25-26</a>, where He speaks against Egypt. Theologically, this reflects the theme of divine judgment and the ultimate authority of God over nations, a recurring motif throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_egypt.htm">Wise Men of Egypt</a></b><br>These were the counselors and advisors in Egypt, known for their wisdom and knowledge.

The nation once prided itself on magicians and sages who served Pharaoh (see <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>: &#8220;Pharaoh&#8230; summoned the wise men and sorcerers&#8221;). Yet in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19</a> the Lord has already &#8220;poured into her a spirit of confusion&#8221; (v. 14). The challenge highlights three truths:<p>&#8226;&#8194;Human brilliance collapses when God withdraws common grace (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Earthly wisdom cannot halt divine judgment (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Past reputation is no refuge; present reality exposes impotence (<a href="/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them tell you</b><p>The prophet invites Egypt&#8217;s intellectual elite to step forward and explain what is happening. Similar invitations appear when God mocks idols: &#8220;Let them present and declare to us what is going to happen&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22-23</a>). In Scripture, whenever men are asked to predict or interpret apart from God, they fail:<p>&#8226;&#8194;The court seers of Babylon could not recount Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream (<a href="/daniel/2-27.htm">Daniel 2:27</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;Ahab&#8217;s prophets promised victory, yet the true word proved opposite (<a href="/1_kings/22-12.htm">1 Kings 22:12-23</a>).<p>God&#8217;s question is rhetorical; Egypt&#8217;s pundits have nothing to say because revelation belongs to the Lord alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reveal what the LORD of Hosts has planned against Egypt.</b><p>The final clause centers on the only insight that matters&#8212;what God has planned. Earlier in the chapter the Lord details that plan:<p>&#8226;&#8194;&#8220;Behold, the LORD is riding on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8194;&#8220;The waters of the Nile will dry up&#8221; (v. 5).<p>&#8226;&#8194;&#8220;I will hand the Egyptians over to a cruel master&#8221; (v. 4).<p>No astrologer can overturn or even foresee these decrees. Parallel prophecies echo the certainty: <a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25-26</a> foretells punishment of Egypt&#8217;s gods; <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-12</a> describes the nation&#8217;s desolation. Each passage underscores that the Lord of Hosts commands history, armies, and nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/19-12.htm">Isaiah 19:12</a> exposes the emptiness of Egypt&#8217;s vaunted wisdom and declares that only the Lord reveals and accomplishes the future. Human experts fall silent; God&#8217;s plan stands. The verse calls every reader to abandon trust in earthly insight and instead listen to the sure, sovereign word of the Lord, who alone directs the destinies of nations and individuals alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are they? where</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Where</span>, <span class="accented">then</span>, <span class="accented">are thy wise men?</span> If thou hast any, let them come forward and predict the coming course of events, what Jehovah has determined to do (compare similar challenges in the later chapters of the book, <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-23</a>;
