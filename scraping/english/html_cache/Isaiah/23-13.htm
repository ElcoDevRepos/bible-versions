They are often associated with the Babylonians, as they eventually rose to power in Babylon. This phrase invites the reader to consider the fate of the Chaldeans, who were once a significant power in the region. The Chaldeans are mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in the book of Daniel, where they are known for their wisdom and astrology.<p><b>a people now of no account</b><br>This indicates the decline of the Chaldeans from a position of power and influence to insignificance. Historically, the Chaldeans were eventually conquered by the Persians, leading to their diminished status. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly power and the sovereignty of God over nations.<p><b>The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures</b><br>The Assyrians were a dominant empire in the ancient Near East, known for their military prowess and conquests. They often devastated the lands they conquered, leaving them desolate. The reference to "desert creatures" suggests a complete desolation, where once-thriving cities are reduced to wilderness. This reflects the Assyrian practice of destroying cities and deporting populations, as seen in their conquests of Israel and other nations.<p><b>they set up their siege towers</b><br>Siege towers were a common military tactic used by ancient armies to breach the walls of fortified cities. The Assyrians were particularly known for their advanced siege techniques. This phrase highlights the methodical and relentless nature of the Assyrian military campaigns, which often resulted in the complete subjugation of their enemies.<p><b>and stripped its palaces</b><br>This indicates the thorough plundering and destruction of the Chaldean palaces by the Assyrians. Palaces were symbols of wealth and power, and their stripping signifies the complete humiliation and defeat of the Chaldeans. This act of stripping can be seen as a metaphor for divine judgment, where God allows the pride of nations to be brought low.<p><b>They brought it to ruin</b><br>The finality of this phrase underscores the total destruction wrought by the Assyrians. It serves as a fulfillment of divine prophecy and judgment against the Chaldeans. This ruin is a testament to the consequences of pride and rebellion against God, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books of the Bible. The ruin of the Chaldeans can also be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment that will come upon all nations that oppose God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>Originally a Semitic-speaking people in southern Babylonia, the Chaldeans became synonymous with the Babylonians.

If Babylon&#8217;s greatness crumbled, Tyre&#8217;s merchants should not imagine immunity, and neither should any modern power. The verse calls believers to trust God&#8217;s absolute rule over history and to reject the empty security of human pride.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">land of Kasdim. </span>The prophet points to the destruction of one power that had resisted Assyria as an example of what Tyre might expect. The Assyrian inscriptions record the conquests referred to. Sargon relates his victory over the "perverse and rebellious Chaldaeans," who had rebelled under Merodach-baladan (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>vii. 41, 45). Towns were pillaged, 80,570 men carried away captive from a single city. Sennacherib (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>p. 59) boasts of having plundered Babylon itself, and all the "strong cities and castles of the land of the Chaldaeans"; and again, of having crushed another revolt under Suzab the Babylonian (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>i. 47-49). The words that follow on this survey are better rendered: <span class= "ital">This people is no more: Asshur appointeth it for the desert beasts. They set up their towers, they destroy its palaces. </span>The "towers are those of the Assyrian besiegers attacking Babylon; the palaces, those of the attacked. The words have, however, often been interpreted as pointing to the origin and migration of the Chaldaeans, as having had scarcely any national existence till Assyria had brought them into the plains of the Euphrates. The English version seems based upon this interpretation of the passage. It is obvious, however, that such a fragment of ethnological history does not cohere well with the context, and gives a less satisfactory meaning. It is doubtful, too, whether the supposed history itself rests on any adequate evidence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold the land of the Chaldeans</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14, 20</a>). Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Isaiah knows the people as Chahleans (Kasdim), the capital as Babylon. Kaldi, in the inscriptions, is a rare word, and the name of a not very important tribe.

There is no "till" in the original. The clause is separate and independent, not connected grammatically with the preceding. Nor does it assert that the Assyrians "founded" Babylon for any one, but only that they "established" it, or "appointed" it to be a habitation for "the <span class="accented">beasts of the desert"</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:39, etc.). The prophet views the Assyrians as intending to reduce Babylon to ruins, and leave it waste and uninhabited. <span class="cmt_word">The towers thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the siege-towers requisite for reducing so strong a city. <span class="cmt_word">They raised up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they made bare</span> (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He brought it to ruin</span>. "He" is "the Assyrian." The case of Babylon is adduced to increase the alarm of Tyro, by reminding the inhabitants of what the Assyrians had done to a town greater and stronger than their own. The allusion is probably to certain severities of Sargon's in <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, which, however, are rhetorically exaggerated. It was never the policy of the Assyrians to depopulate or destroy Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/23-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Look at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;
