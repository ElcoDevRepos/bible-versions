It implies that the knowledge of God&#8217;s greatness should be evident and accessible to all. This echoes the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. It also reflects the idea that God's attributes are evident in creation, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where Paul states that God's invisible qualities have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.<p><b>Have you not heard?</b><br>This phrase suggests that the truth about God has been communicated verbally, possibly through the oral traditions and teachings of the prophets. It emphasizes the importance of listening to and remembering the teachings of the past. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, the Shema instructs the Israelites to hear and remember the Lord's commandments, highlighting the significance of hearing in the transmission of faith.<p><b>Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?</b><br>This points to the longstanding revelation of God's nature and works, suggesting that these truths have been proclaimed since the earliest times. It may refer to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God&#8217;s power and purpose are first revealed. The phrase underscores the continuity and consistency of God's message throughout history, aligning with the idea that God&#8217;s word is eternal, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>.<p><b>Have you not understood since the foundation of the earth?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the foundational nature of God's revelation, suggesting that understanding of God should be as fundamental as the creation itself. It implies that the order and design of the universe testify to God's existence and attributes. This is consistent with the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38</a>, where God questions Job about the creation of the world, highlighting human limitations in understanding divine wisdom. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the foundation of all creation, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word through whom all things were made.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Israel during a time of impending judgment and future hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, often reminded of their covenant relationship with God and their history of receiving divine revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The reference to "the foundations of the earth" points to the act of creation, emphasizing God's eternal power and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_revelation.htm">God's Eternal Revelation</a></b><br>God's truth has been evident from the beginning of creation.
