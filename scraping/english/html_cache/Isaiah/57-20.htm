In biblical literature, the sea often symbolizes chaos and disorder, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>. The wicked, like the sea, are restless and lack peace, reflecting their inner turmoil and separation from God. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme that true peace is found only in God (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p><b>for it cannot be still</b><br>The inability of the sea to be still mirrors the restless nature of the wicked. This restlessness is a consequence of living apart from God's righteousness. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the sea was often feared and respected for its unpredictability and power, much like the destructive potential of wickedness. This phrase emphasizes the perpetual state of unrest and dissatisfaction that characterizes those who reject God's ways.<p><b>and its waves churn up mire and muck</b><br>The churning of mire and muck signifies the moral and spiritual filth that results from a life of wickedness. Just as the sea's turbulence brings up debris from the ocean floor, the actions of the wicked reveal the corruption within. This imagery is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, which describes the wicked as unable to sleep unless they have done evil. The phrase underscores the destructive impact of sin, both on the individual and on society, and serves as a warning of the consequences of living in opposition to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

The wicked are never at ease; their inner world mirrors the crashing waves.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently uses nature&#8217;s turbulence to describe spiritual rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>; <a href="/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By opening with &#8220;But,&#8221; God contrasts the wicked with the repentant He had just invited to peace (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15&#8211;19</a>). The dividing line is not socioeconomic status or personality, but repentance versus obstinacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it cannot be still</b><p>&#8226; The inability to rest is inherent&#8212;&#8220;it cannot.&#8221; Just as the sea has no switch to turn off the tide, the unregenerate heart has no built-in peace.<p>&#8226; Isaiah brackets this passage with the solemn refrain &#8220;There is no peace&#8230;for the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; 57:21). God is explaining why: their nature resists His order.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a> highlights the same truth: &#8220;For they cannot sleep until they do evil.&#8221; Restlessness becomes relentless.<p>&#8226; In gracious contrast, the Lord invites, &#8220;Come to Me&#8230;and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Only a changed heart can enter that stillness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its waves churn up mire and muck</b><p>&#8226; Stormy waves don&#8217;t merely splash water; they drag hidden sludge to the surface. Likewise, wickedness exposes corruption already within (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Churning sea water clouds vision; sin clouds judgment. People in rebellion often blame circumstances, yet Scripture says the pollution comes from their own depths (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery of &#8220;mire&#8221; ties to <a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>, portraying those who return to their filth. Sin not only manifests but multiplies, spreading moral mud to everyone nearby.<p>&#8226; The verse therefore warns: persistent rebellion doesn&#8217;t stay private. It soils communities, families, and cultures, just as muddy surf fouls everything on the shoreline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> delivers a sober snapshot of the unrepentant heart: ceaselessly agitated, incapable of rest, and inevitably spewing out moral filth. Like a storm-tossed sea, the wicked possess no inner anchor; their very nature generates turmoil. Only God&#8217;s saving grace can calm that sea, replacing chaos with the peace promised to all who humble themselves and trust His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The wicked are like the troubled sea . . .</span>--The promise of healing is, however, not unconditional. The acceptance of peace requires calmness; but for the wicked, whose thoughts are restlessly seething with evil ripening into act, this true peace is, in the nature of the case, impossible. We note the recurrence of the watchword of <a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm" title="There is no peace, said the LORD, to the wicked.">Isaiah 48:22</a>, as indicating the close of another section of the prophecy. The MSS. and versions present a curious variation in <a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm" title="There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked.">Isaiah 57:21</a> : some "saith Jehovah," some "God," some "the Lord God." It would almost seem as if transcribers and translators had shrunk from the prophet's boldness in claiming God as in some special sense his God. It has a parallel, however, in <a href="/isaiah/7-13.htm" title="And he said, Hear you now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?">Isaiah 7:13</a>, and may be noted, accordingly, as one of the characteristic touches common to the two parts of Isaiah. The "Sea" of which Isaiah speaks may possibly have been the Dead Sea, casting up its salt bituminous deposits.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wicked are like the troubled sea</span>. A striking metaphor, but one which occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, and once only in the New (<a href="/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a>). The sea's restless action well expresses the unquiet of the wicked; and the mud and mire that it casts up resembles their evil thoughts and evil deeds. "There is no peace" for such persons, either bodily or spiritual, either in this world or the world to come. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/57-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
