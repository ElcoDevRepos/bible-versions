In the Old Testament, foreigners were often seen as outsiders, but this passage emphasizes that those who commit themselves to the LORD are not to be excluded. This reflects the universal scope of God's salvation plan, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises Abraham that all nations will be blessed through him. The idea of foreigners joining themselves to the LORD foreshadows the New Testament inclusion of Gentiles into the faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with the conversion of Cornelius.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.&#8221;</b><br>Historically, the Israelites were a distinct people, set apart by God through the covenant with Abraham and the Law given to Moses. However, this phrase reassures that those who genuinely seek the LORD, regardless of their ethnic background, will not be excluded. This is consistent with the message of <a href="/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>, which emphasizes justice and righteousness for all who follow God. It aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, where Paul states that Gentiles are no longer strangers and aliens but fellow citizens with the saints.<p><b>And let the eunuch not say,</b><br>Eunuchs were often marginalized in ancient societies, including Israel, due to their inability to procreate and their perceived incompleteness. <a href="/deuteronomy/23.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a> explicitly states that eunuchs were not to enter the assembly of the LORD, highlighting their exclusion. However, this passage in Isaiah marks a significant shift, indicating that physical limitations or societal status do not determine one's standing before God. This inclusion is a precursor to the New Testament message of spiritual rebirth and equality in Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<p><b>&#8220;I am but a dry tree.&#8221;</b><br>The metaphor of a "dry tree" symbolizes barrenness and lack of legacy, as trees are often associated with life and prosperity in biblical imagery. For a eunuch, this would have been a poignant expression of their perceived lack of worth and future. However, <a href="/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a> promises that those who keep God's covenant will be given a name better than sons and daughters, suggesting a spiritual legacy that transcends physical limitations. This echoes the promise of eternal life and spiritual fruitfulness found in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him to bear much fruit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites who have chosen to worship the God of Israel.

In earlier days foreigners could feel like perpetual outsiders (see <a href="/exodus/12-43.htm">Exodus 12:43&#8211;45</a>), yet the Lord here rules out that fear.<p>&#8226; God promises full belonging. Isaiah has already painted this welcome: &#8220;My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). Jesus echoes that in <a href="/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture the Lord embraces believing foreigners:<p>&#8211; Ruth the Moabitess is folded into Israel and even Messiah&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Solomon prays that God would hear &#8220;the foreigner who comes&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41-43</a>).<p>&#8211; Paul writes that once-alienated Gentiles are now &#8220;fellow citizens with the saints&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise is not merely tolerance but inclusion. Believing Gentiles share the same covenant blessings promised to Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And let the eunuch not say, &#8220;I am but a dry tree.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; A eunuch in ancient Israel carried a double sorrow: physical incapacity for children and exclusion from temple worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s word overturns both.<p>&#8226; God assures fruitfulness where there seemed none. He soon adds, &#8220;I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/56-5.htm">Isaiah 56:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture spotlights this promise fulfilled:<p>&#8211; In <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-39</a>, an Ethiopian eunuch believes and is baptized, immediately finding welcome in Christ.<p>&#8211; The Spirit often highlights barren or childless people receiving unexpected fruitfulness (<a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>; <a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; For anyone who feels sterile&#8212;whether physically, emotionally, or spiritually&#8212;God offers an enduring legacy through faith, not biology. He makes lives fruitful in ways that matter eternally (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5, 16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a> wipes away two deep insecurities: the foreigner&#8217;s fear of never truly belonging and the eunuch&#8217;s despair of fruitlessness. God promises that everyone who clings to Him in covenant faith is welcomed, treasured, and given lasting fruit. Outsiders become family, and the childless receive an everlasting name. The passage anticipates the gospel&#8217;s wide embrace&#8212;fulfilled in Christ, proclaimed through the church, and available to all who come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/56.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Neither let the son of</span> <span class= "bld">the stranger . . .</span>--Two classes of persons were likely to suffer specially from Manasseh's policy--(1) the heathen proselytes, who, as in Psalms 87, had been admitted as citizens of Zion under Hezekiah's special protection; and (2) in the highest degree, those of that body who had been taken, as Ebed-Melech afterwards was (<a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), into the king's household as eunuchs. The courtiers of Manasseh would taunt them as aliens, and in the second case would press the letter of <a href="/deuteronomy/23-2.htm" title="A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>. The principle of Isaiah's teaching was, of course, applicable to the Israelites who, like Daniel and his friends, had been mutilated against their will by heathen conquerors (<a href="/daniel/1-3.htm" title="And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;">Daniel 1:3</a>), and most commentators refer the words to such cases. It is scarcely probable, however, that the household of Hezekiah would have been supplied with home-born eunuchs, and, on the hypothesis which I have adopted, I find in the eunuchs a sub-section of the proselytes. The words put into the mouths of the complainers are the natural utterances of men treated as they had been.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The son of the stranger</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the foreigner, who has become a proselyte. During the depression of the Captivity these are not likely to have been many. Still, there were doubtless some; and these, who had embraced Judaism under such unfavourable circumstances, were entitled to special consideration. As Messianic hopes prevailed, and the time of restoration to Palestine drew near (ver. 1), they might naturally be afraid that they would not be looked upon as equals by the native Israelites, but would be made into a lower grade, if not even excluded. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath utterly separated me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord will utterly separate me.</span> They do not suppose it done, but think it will be done. <span class="cmt_word">The eunuch</span>.

Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were such persons (<a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-6</a>), and there may have been others. By the letter of the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>), they were cut off from the congregation, but practically it would seem that during the Captivity they were on a par with other Israelites. These persons feared, with more reason than the foreign proselytes, that, on the return of Israel to their own land, a stricter practice would be established than had prevailed during the Captivity, and the letter of the Law would be enforced against them. I am a dry tree.
