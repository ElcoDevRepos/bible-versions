The prophet is instructed to speak with clarity and without fear, reflecting the seriousness of the message. This mirrors the role of prophets throughout the Bible, who were often called to deliver difficult truths to God's people, regardless of the potential backlash or personal cost. The call to "not hold back" suggests the importance of full disclosure of God's word, reminiscent of Ezekiel's role as a watchman (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-19</a>).<p><b>Raise your voice like a ram&#8217;s horn.</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, was used in ancient Israel for various purposes, including calling people to worship, signaling the start of festivals, or warning of impending danger. Its sound was loud and unmistakable, symbolizing the need for the message to be heard clearly by all. This imagery underscores the urgency and importance of the message, akin to the call to repentance and preparation for the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>).<p><b>Declare to My people their transgression</b><br>The term "My people" indicates a covenant relationship between God and Israel. The focus on "transgression" highlights the breach of this covenant, where the people have strayed from God's laws and commands. This call to declare their transgressions is a common prophetic theme, seen in the ministries of prophets like Jeremiah and Amos, who were tasked with calling Israel back to faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p><b>and to the house of Jacob their sins.</b><br>The "house of Jacob" refers to the descendants of Jacob, or Israel, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen people. The mention of "sins" points to specific acts of disobedience and moral failings. This phrase serves as a reminder of the historical and spiritual heritage of the Israelites, who are called to live in accordance with God's statutes. The dual mention of "transgression" and "sins" underscores the comprehensive nature of their wrongdoing, necessitating a call to repentance similar to that found in the messages of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
