In biblical context, righteousness is a key attribute of God's character, often associated with justice and moral integrity. The poor, often marginalized and oppressed in ancient societies, are highlighted here to show that the Messiah will bring justice to those who are typically overlooked. This reflects the biblical theme of God's concern for the downtrodden, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, which speaks of defending the afflicted among the people and saving the children of the needy.<p><b>and with equity He will decide for the lowly of the earth</b><br>Equity here refers to fairness and impartiality. The lowly, similar to the poor, are those who lack power and influence. The Messiah's judgment will be characterized by fairness, contrasting with the often corrupt and biased judgments of human rulers. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where God is described as executing justice for the fatherless and the widow. The Messiah's reign will correct injustices and bring about a new order where all are treated with fairness.<p><b>He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth</b><br>The "rod of His mouth" symbolizes the power and authority of the Messiah's word. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a rod was a symbol of authority and discipline. This imagery suggests that the Messiah's words alone will have the power to enact judgment and bring about change. This is echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where the returning Christ is described as striking down the nations with a sharp sword from His mouth, indicating the power of His spoken word.<p><b>and slay the wicked with the breath of His lips</b><br>The breath of His lips signifies the life-giving and life-taking power of the Messiah's word. In the biblical narrative, God's breath is associated with creation and life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), but here it is also associated with judgment and destruction of the wicked. This duality highlights the comprehensive authority of the Messiah. The concept of divine judgment through spoken word is also seen in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, where the Lord Jesus will overthrow the lawless one with the breath of His mouth, underscoring the ultimate triumph of righteousness over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>The central figure in this prophecy, who will judge with righteousness and equity.

There is an intended contrast between the Messiah's rule in this respect, and that of the princes of Judah (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1, 2</a>). Christian countries still, for the most part, follow their Lord's example in this particular, if in no other, having judges that are incorruptible, and tribunals that are free from any leaning against the poor. <span class="cmt_word">Reprove</span>; or, <span class="accented">plead</span> (as in <a href="/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The meek of the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the humble</span>, or <span class="accented">afflicted</span>. Low condition, not meekness of spirit, is what the word used expresses. <span class="cmt_word">He shall smite the earth.</span> A slight alteration of the text produces the meaning, <span class="accented">be shall smite the terrible one</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>), which improves the parallelism of the clauses. But there is no need of any alteration, parallelism in Isaiah being often incomplete. The Messiah at his coming will "smite <span class="accented">the earth"</span> generally (see <a href="/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, and comp. <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>, "I came not to send peace on the earth, but a sword"), and will also especially chastise "the wicked." <span class="cmt_word">The rod of his mouth... the breath of his lips</span>. "The Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). The sayings of Christ pierce the conscience and penetrate the soul as no other words that ever came from a human mouth. In the last day words from his mouth will consign to everlasting life or to everlasting destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but with righteousness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1462;&#1433;&#1491;&#1462;&#1511;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7779;e&#183;&#7695;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
