In ancient Israel, priests held a significant religious role, mediating between God and the people. However, this passage underscores that in the face of divine judgment, social and religious distinctions are irrelevant. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, where all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, highlighting the impartiality of God's justice.<p><b>servant and master</b><br>The relationship between servant and master was a fundamental aspect of ancient Near Eastern society. This phrase indicates that God's judgment will not discriminate based on social status or power dynamics. It reflects the biblical principle that all are equal before God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where distinctions such as slave or free are nullified in Christ.<p><b>maid and mistress</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this highlights the equality of all individuals before God's judgment, regardless of gender or social hierarchy. In the cultural context, maids and mistresses had distinct roles, yet this passage asserts that both are subject to the same divine scrutiny, reinforcing the message of universal accountability.<p><b>buyer and seller</b><br>This phrase addresses economic transactions, a vital part of daily life in ancient times. It suggests that economic status or activity will not exempt anyone from God's judgment. This can be connected to <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>, where the misuse of wealth and exploitation of others are condemned, emphasizing that material wealth does not influence one's standing before God.<p><b>lender and borrower</b><br>In biblical times, lending and borrowing were common practices, often leading to complex social and economic relationships. This phrase indicates that financial dealings will not shield individuals from divine judgment. It aligns with the teachings in <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>, where the borrower is servant to the lender, yet both are ultimately accountable to God.<p><b>creditor and debtor</b><br>This final phrase in the verse continues the theme of economic relationships, highlighting that both those who give credit and those who owe are equally subject to God's judgment. It reflects the biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-2</a>, where the law of debt release is established, pointing to God's concern for equity and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_and_priest.htm">People and Priest</a></b><br>Represents the general populace and religious leaders, indicating that divine judgment is impartial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant_and_master.htm">Servant and Master</a></b><br>Symbolizes social hierarchies, emphasizing that all social statuses are subject to God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/maid_and_mistress.htm">Maid and Mistress</a></b><br>Highlights gender roles and domestic relationships, showing that God's judgment transcends these distinctions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/buyer_and_seller.htm">Buyer and Seller</a></b><br>Reflects economic transactions, suggesting that commerce and trade will not escape divine scrutiny.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lender_and_borrower,_creditor_and_debtor.htm">Lender and Borrower, Creditor and Debtor</a></b><br>Points to financial relationships, indicating that financial status offers no protection from God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/impartiality_of_god's_judgment.htm">Impartiality of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is not influenced by human status or roles.

Yet Isaiah shows their titles cannot shield them (<a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s impartiality is consistent throughout Scripture. He &#8220;shows no favoritism&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>) and judges &#8220;from the greatest to the least&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this warning: those who teach are held to stricter judgment (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>), and even elders are disciplined if they persist in sin (<a href="/1_timothy/5-19.htm">1 Timothy 5:19-21</a>).<p><a href="/bsb/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a> presses the point that everyone, clergy included, must personally reckon with the Holy One of Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>servant and master</b><p>&#8220;It will be the same for the servant as for his master.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Earthly hierarchies dissolve when the Lord moves in justice (<a href="/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13-15</a>). The servant who normally answers to the master now faces the same divine verdict.<p>&#8226; Jesus underscores the theme: the faithful or unfaithful servant is judged by the Lord of the household (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-48</a>).<p>&#8226; Masters are warned to treat servants justly &#8220;because you also have a Master in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>). Isaiah flips the usual order: both stand side-by-side under God&#8217;s gaze.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>maid and mistress</b><p>&#8220;the maid as for her mistress&#8221;<p>&#8226; Even in the domestic realm, God&#8217;s judgment is not selective. Household rank&#8212;maid versus mistress&#8212;carries no weight before Him (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Hagar and Sarah illustrate that God sees both slave girl and free woman (<a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>; 21:12-13). Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy widens that principle to the entire earth in a day of devastation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>buyer and seller</b><p>&#8220;the buyer as for the seller&#8221;<p>&#8226; Commerce cannot buy deliverance. Amos had already condemned dishonest scales (<a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4-7</a>); Isaiah warns that even honest trade offers no exemption.<p>&#8226; Jesus drives money changers from the temple (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>), showing that economic roles bow to spiritual realities.<p>&#8226; Revelation portrays merchants weeping over Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s language previews that cry: buyers and sellers lose their marketplace together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lender and borrower</b><p>&#8220;the lender as for the borrower&#8221;<p>&#8226; Credit arrangements may shape earthly influence, yet both parties share one Creator who &#8220;owns the cattle on a thousand hills&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs cautions that &#8220;the borrower is slave to the lender&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>), but Isaiah announces a moment when both lender and borrower are equally powerless.<p>&#8226; This anticipates the Year of Jubilee ideal&#8212;debts canceled, land returned (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>)&#8212;but here the cancellation comes through sweeping judgment, not a festival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>creditor and debtor</b><p>&#8220;the creditor as for the debtor&#8221;<p>&#8226; Isaiah doubles the financial image, reinforcing that monetary status is meaningless before divine wrath (<a href="/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; parable of the unforgiving servant (<a href="/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>) shows that owing or being owed cannot compare with the debt every soul owes to God.<p>&#8226; Revelation again resonates: kings, commanders, rich, poor all hide in caves crying, &#8220;Fall on us&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>). The vocabulary differs; the reality is identical.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a> stacks six paired relationships to paint one unmistakable picture: when the Lord unleashes final, earth-shaking judgment, no human distinction&#8212;religious office, social rank, gender role, economic power&#8212;offers refuge. Every person stands on level ground before the righteous Judge. The prophecy calls us to flee not to status, wealth, or influence, but to the only safe place: humble repentance and wholehearted trust in the Lord who both judges sin and, through Christ, freely justifies all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">It shall be, as with the people . . .</span>--In the apparently general classification there is, perhaps, in the last two clauses a trace of the prophet's indignation at the growing tendency of the people to the luxury which led to debt, and to the avarice which traded on the debtor's necessities. Israel, it would seem, was already on the way to become a nation of money lenders.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be, as with the people, so with the priest</span>, etc. There shall be "no respect of persons" - no favor shown to men of any particular rank or station. All shall suffer equally. The author is obliged to take as examples distinctions of rank known to him; but he carefully selects such as are of almost universal occurrence. There was scarcely any nation of antiquity in which there were not "priests and people," "masters and slaves," "buyers and sellers," "lenders and borrowers," "takers and givers of usury." By "usury" is meant, not exorbitant interest, but interest simply, of whatever amount. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/24-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124;
