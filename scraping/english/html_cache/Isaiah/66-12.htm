It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the words are not from the prophet himself but from God. This establishes the importance and reliability of the prophecy, as seen throughout the Old Testament in books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>I will extend peace to her like a river:</b><br>The imagery of peace flowing like a river suggests abundance, continuity, and life-giving sustenance. Rivers in the ancient Near East were vital for survival, symbolizing prosperity and divine blessing. This promise of peace can be connected to the Messianic hope found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace."<p><b>and the wealth of nations like a flowing stream:</b><br>This phrase indicates a future time of prosperity and blessing for Jerusalem, where the wealth of the Gentiles will come to her. Historically, this reflects the post-exilic hope of restoration and the eschatological vision of nations bringing their riches to Zion, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>. It also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>you will nurse and be carried on her arm:</b><br>The nurturing imagery here reflects God's care and provision for His people, akin to a mother caring for her child. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers spiritual nourishment and support to believers. The nurturing aspect is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of gathering His people like a hen gathers her chicks (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>and bounced upon her knees:</b><br>This phrase continues the maternal imagery, suggesting joy, comfort, and intimacy. It reflects the deep relationship between God and His people, akin to a parent delighting in their child. This intimate care is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's love and compassion, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah, promising peace and prosperity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem (implied)</a></b><br>The city symbolizing God's people, to whom peace and wealth will be extended.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations (Gentiles)</a></b><br>Representing the wealth and resources that will flow into Jerusalem, signifying inclusion and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of hope and restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_and_wealth.htm">Peace and Wealth</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's blessings and the restoration of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_peace.htm">God's Promise of Peace</a></b><br>God's peace is abundant and continuous, like a river.
