The kings of Assyria, such as Tiglath-Pileser III, Shalmaneser V, Sargon II, and Sennacherib, expanded their territory through aggressive campaigns. Historical records and archaeological findings, such as the annals of Sennacherib, confirm the widespread destruction and subjugation of nations. This phrase highlights the fear and intimidation tactics used by Assyria, which were well-known throughout the ancient Near East. The Assyrians often employed psychological warfare, spreading tales of their victories to demoralize their enemies.<p><b>devoting them to destruction</b><br>The phrase "devoting them to destruction" reflects the Assyrian practice of total warfare, where conquered cities were often completely destroyed, and their inhabitants killed or exiled. This concept is reminiscent of the Hebrew term "herem," used in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan, where certain cities were devoted to destruction as an offering to God (e.g., Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>). The Assyrians, however, did this for their own glory and power, contrasting with the divine mandate given to Israel. This phrase underscores the severity of Assyrian conquests and the threat they posed to Judah.<p><b>Will you then be spared?</b><br>This rhetorical question is a direct challenge to the faith and resolve of the people of Judah. It implies that, given the Assyrians' track record, Judah's survival seems unlikely. However, this sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, as Hezekiah's prayer and Isaiah's prophecy lead to divine intervention (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>). This question also serves as a test of faith, urging the people to trust in God rather than fear human power. It echoes the biblical theme that true deliverance comes from reliance on God, not on human strength or alliances, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Assyria&#8217;s history was real, but God&#8217;s sovereignty was greater.
