This reflects a broader biblical theme where truth is often associated with God's character and His Word (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). The absence of truth indicates a moral and spiritual decline, similar to the conditions described in the time of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). This phrase highlights the societal breakdown and the consequences of turning away from God's standards.<p><b>and whoever turns from evil becomes prey</b><br>This phrase illustrates the peril faced by those who choose righteousness in a corrupt society. It echoes the experiences of prophets and righteous individuals throughout the Bible who faced persecution for their faithfulness, such as Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-5</a>). The imagery of becoming "prey" suggests vulnerability and danger, emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the spiritual battle between good and evil (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>The LORD looked and was displeased</b><br>This phrase indicates God's active awareness and concern for justice and righteousness on earth. It reflects God's omniscience and His role as the ultimate judge (<a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4-5</a>). The divine displeasure is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God expresses His sorrow and anger over Israel's unfaithfulness and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/5.htm">Jeremiah 5:1-9</a>). It underscores the personal nature of God's relationship with His people and His desire for them to live according to His will.<p><b>that there was no justice</b><br>The absence of justice is a central concern in the prophetic literature, where justice is often linked with righteousness and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). In the historical context of Isaiah, this lack of justice could refer to the social and political corruption prevalent in Judah, where leaders failed to uphold God's laws (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>). The call for justice is also a messianic theme, as the coming Messiah is prophesied to establish true justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>), pointing ultimately to Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect justice and will one day restore all things (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel, warning them of their sins and calling them to repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is observing the moral and spiritual state of His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Isaiah is prophesying, experiencing a time of moral decline and injustice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/truth.htm">Truth</a></b><br>Personified as missing, indicating a societal collapse in moral and ethical standards.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/justice.htm">Justice</a></b><br>The divine standard of righteousness that is absent, causing God's displeasure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>In a world where truth is often compromised, Christians are called to uphold and live by the truth of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_turning_from_evil.htm">The Consequences of Turning from Evil</a></b><br>Those who choose righteousness may face opposition or become prey, but they are called to stand firm in their convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_displeasure_with_injustice.htm">God's Displeasure with Injustice</a></b><br>God is deeply concerned with justice, and His people are called to reflect His character by pursuing justice in their communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_believer.htm">The Role of the Believer</a></b><br>Believers are to be beacons of truth and justice, actively working against the moral decline in society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_observation.htm">Divine Observation</a></b><br>God sees the state of the world and is displeased with the lack of justice, reminding us that He is aware and will act in His time.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_59_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 59:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_59_15_Effects_of_truth_rejection.htm">How does Isaiah 59:15 highlight the consequences of rejecting truth in society?

In Isaiah&#8217;s day prophets whitewashed sin (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>), and leaders twisted words for profit (<a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse is literally fulfilled whenever courts, classrooms, media, and even churches discard Scripture as final authority. <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a> laments, &#8220;The godly man has perished from the earth&#8230;each hunts his brother with a net.&#8221; That is the climate <a href="/isaiah/59-15.htm">Isaiah 59:15</a> describes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Whoever turns from evil becomes prey&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; In a culture allergic to truth, anyone who repents and walks uprightly becomes a target. &#8220;Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The righteous are &#8220;prey&#8221; in two ways:<p>&#8211; Social hostility&#8212;mockery, exclusion, even violence (<a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Institutional injustice&#8212;courts and systems punish those who refuse to compromise (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God reassures His people: &#8220;Who can harm you if you are zealous for what is good?&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-13.htm">1 Peter 3:13</a>).
