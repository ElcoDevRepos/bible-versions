Throughout the Bible, God frequently tells His people not to fear, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/matthew/10-31.htm">Matthew 10:31</a>. This command is rooted in the understanding that God is in control and that His presence dispels fear. In the context of Isaiah, the Israelites were facing threats from surrounding nations, but God reminds them that He is their protector.<p><b>Have I not told you and declared it long ago?</b><br>Here, God is reminding the Israelites of His past declarations and prophecies, emphasizing His omniscience and faithfulness. This phrase underscores the reliability of God's word, as He has consistently revealed His plans to His people. The reference to "long ago" highlights the continuity of God's message and His unchanging nature, as seen in <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>.<p><b>You are My witnesses!</b><br>God calls the Israelites His witnesses, indicating their role in testifying to His power and faithfulness. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be witnesses of Christ (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The Israelites' history of experiencing God's deliverance and miracles serves as evidence of His sovereignty and serves to affirm His identity to the nations.<p><b>Is there any God but Me?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the monotheistic belief central to Israel's faith. In a polytheistic ancient Near Eastern context, this declaration sets the God of Israel apart from the idols worshiped by surrounding nations. This exclusivity is a recurring theme in Isaiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>, reinforcing the idea that Yahweh is the only true God.<p><b>There is no other Rock; I know not one.&#8221;</b><br>The term "Rock" symbolizes strength, stability, and reliability, attributes of God that are frequently mentioned in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). This metaphor highlights God's unchanging nature and His role as a refuge for His people. The assertion that there is no other rock underscores the futility of idol worship and the uniqueness of God's character and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Judah was often tempted to follow the idolatrous practices of surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh (God)</a></b><br>The one true God, who is speaking through Isaiah in this passage, affirming His uniqueness and sovereignty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, who are called to testify to the truth of God's existence and His works.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rock.htm">Rock</a></b><br>A metaphor for God, symbolizing strength, stability, and reliability.
