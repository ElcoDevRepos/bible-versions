In biblical context, God often calls His people to listen as a prelude to delivering important instructions or promises (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). It underscores the authority of God and the necessity for His people to heed His words.<p><b>you who pursue righteousness,</b><br>This refers to those who actively seek to live in accordance with God's will and commandments. Righteousness in the Old Testament is often associated with justice, ethical behavior, and faithfulness to God's covenant. It implies a deliberate and ongoing effort to align one's life with divine standards, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-5</a>.<p><b>you who seek the LORD:</b><br>Seeking the LORD involves a deep, personal relationship with God, characterized by prayer, worship, and obedience. It reflects a heart that desires to know God more intimately and to follow His ways. This pursuit is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where seeking God with all one's heart is promised to result in finding Him.<p><b>Look to the rock from which you were cut,</b><br>The "rock" symbolizes stability, strength, and origin. In a historical context, it refers to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, as the foundation of the Israelite nation. This imagery is used to remind the people of their spiritual heritage and the faith of their ancestors. The rock is also a type of Christ, who is referred to as the spiritual rock in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>.<p><b>and to the quarry from which you were hewn.</b><br>The "quarry" suggests the source or origin, emphasizing the idea of being shaped and formed by God. It points to the collective identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people, fashioned for His purposes. This imagery reinforces the call to remember their beginnings and the faithfulness of God throughout their history, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
