Biblically, righteousness is often associated with God's character and His covenant with His people. In the context of Isaiah, this reflects the promise of restoration and renewal for Israel after exile. Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is our righteousness (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). The establishment in righteousness can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant, where believers are justified by faith (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><b>Far from oppression</b><br>The promise of being far from oppression speaks to the deliverance and protection that God provides. Historically, Israel faced numerous oppressors, from Egypt to Babylon. This assurance would have been particularly comforting to the exiled community. It also reflects the eschatological hope of a future where God's people live in peace, free from the tyranny of sin and evil. This can be connected to the ultimate liberation found in Christ, who frees us from the bondage of sin (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>).<p><b>For you will have no fear</b><br>Fear is a common theme in the Bible, often addressed with the assurance of God's presence and protection. This phrase reassures the faithful that they need not fear because God is their defender. In the broader biblical narrative, fear is often countered by faith and trust in God (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>). The absence of fear is a hallmark of the peace that comes from a right relationship with God, as seen in the New Testament promise of peace through Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><b>Terror will be far removed</b><br>This promise extends the idea of security and peace, indicating that not only will fear be absent, but terror itself will be distant. In the historical context, Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations, so this assurance would have been significant. It also points to the ultimate victory over evil, as prophesied in the eschatological visions of peace and safety in the kingdom of God (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><b>For it will not come near you</b><br>The final phrase underscores the complete protection and safety promised to God's people. This assurance is rooted in the covenant relationship with God, who is faithful to protect and preserve His people. It echoes the promises found in the Psalms, where God is depicted as a refuge and fortress (<a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7-10</a>). In the New Testament, this protection is seen in the spiritual security believers have in Christ, who intercedes for us and ensures our ultimate salvation (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34-39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

We stand secure, not on personal goodness, but on the right standing He provides (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Isaiah has already pictured righteousness raining down from heaven (<a href="/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>) and later calls the Servant &#8220;a light to the nations&#8221; who brings that righteousness near (<a href="/isaiah/51-5.htm">Isaiah 51:5</a>). The apostle Paul echoes this when he says Christ &#8220;became to us&#8230; righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). When God establishes us this way:<p>&#8226; Our identity is anchored&#8212;no circumstance can uproot us.<p>&#8226; Our purpose is clarified&#8212;&#8220;seek first the kingdom&#8230;and His righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Our future is guaranteed&#8212;&#8220;the righteous will never be shaken&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/112-6.htm">Psalm 112:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Far from oppression</b><p>To be &#8220;far from oppression&#8221; is to live beyond the reach of crushing injustice. The Lord repeatedly vows to break the yoke of the oppressor (<a href="/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>; 14:3) and is &#8220;a refuge for the oppressed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>). Because He acts for justice (<a href="/psalms/103-6.htm">Psalm 103:6</a>), He not only removes external tyranny but also liberates internally&#8212;freeing us from sin&#8217;s bondage (<a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>). Practical implications:<p>&#8226; We can advocate for the marginalized, confident God stands against oppression.<p>&#8226; We can resist spiritual oppression, claiming the freedom Christ secured (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; We can trust God&#8217;s ultimate vindication when earthly systems fail (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For you will have no fear</b><p>Fear evaporates when righteousness and freedom take root.
