In the prophetic books, such declarations often precede important revelations or judgments. It underscores the seriousness and authenticity of the message, as it comes directly from the LORD, the covenant God of Israel.<p><b>Where is your mother&#8217;s certificate of divorce with which I sent her away?</b><br>This rhetorical question refers to the practice of issuing a certificate of divorce, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>. In the context of Israel, "mother" symbolizes the nation itself. God challenges the notion that He has permanently abandoned Israel, suggesting instead that any separation is not due to His initiative. Historically, Israel's exile was perceived as a form of divine divorce, but God clarifies that it was not a final severance.<p><b>Or to which of My creditors did I sell you?</b><br>This phrase uses the imagery of debt slavery, a common practice in ancient times where individuals could be sold to pay off debts (<a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>). God asserts that He has no creditors, emphasizing that Israel's predicament is not due to any deficiency or obligation on His part. This highlights God's sovereignty and the fact that Israel's suffering is not because of any external compulsion on God.<p><b>Look, you were sold for your iniquities,</b><br>Here, the cause of Israel's suffering is identified as their own sin. The concept of being "sold" for iniquities aligns with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to exile and suffering. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of sin leading to separation from God, a principle that is consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.</b><br>This final phrase reiterates the reason for Israel's exile: their transgressions. The "sending away" of the mother, representing the nation, is a consequence of collective disobedience. This reflects the covenant relationship where blessings and curses are contingent upon Israel's faithfulness. Theologically, it points to the need for repentance and foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ, who reconciles humanity to God despite their transgressions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the people of Israel.
