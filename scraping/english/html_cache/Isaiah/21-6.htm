The prophet Isaiah often received direct communication from God, which he then conveyed to the people. This underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>).<p><b>Go, post a lookout:</b><br>The instruction to post a lookout suggests vigilance and readiness. In ancient times, watchmen were crucial for the security of cities, often stationed on walls or towers to observe approaching threats (<a href="/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>). Spiritually, this can be seen as a call for believers to be watchful and discerning, as echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>and have him report what he sees:</b><br>The lookout's role is to observe and communicate findings, symbolizing the importance of awareness and communication in the community of faith.

Isaiah is not sharing a personal hunch; he is passing along a direct command, just as Jeremiah could say, &#8220;The word of the LORD came to me&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;5</a>) and Peter later affirmed that &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Because Scripture is God-breathed and infallible, we receive this verse as a literal, trustworthy directive that flowed from the Lord to His prophet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go</b><p>A single, urgent verb. When God speaks, His servants move. Abram left Ur at a similar &#8220;Go&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>), and the church was sent to the nations with another (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). In Isaiah&#8217;s context, obedience meant leaving the safety of his present location and stepping into the watchman&#8217;s assignment. For us, it underscores the pattern that revelation from God is meant to be acted upon, not merely admired.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>post a lookout</b><p>The Lord instructs Isaiah to station a watchman&#8212;an advance warning system for the looming judgment against Babylon (the wider theme of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/21.htm">Isaiah 21</a>).<p>&#8226; A watchman&#8217;s job is vigilance. Ezekiel was told, &#8220;I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; 33:7), and Habakkuk said, &#8220;I will stand at my guard post&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the call echoes forward to believers: &#8220;Be sober-minded and alert&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>) and to Jesus&#8217; charge to &#8220;keep watch&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-34.htm">Mark 13:34&#8211;37</a>). God always positions faithful observers who will discern approaching danger and proclaim His warnings.<p>&#8226; Historically, the literal lookout would see the cavalry of Media and Persia approaching (<a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7-9</a>), confirming that Babylon&#8217;s downfall was certain. The prophetic accuracy later echoed in <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have him report what he sees</b><p>Watching is only half the duty; reporting completes it. Silence would make the lookout complicit in the city&#8217;s ruin. Ezekiel felt the same weight: if the watchman fails to sound the alarm, blood is on his hands (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>). Paul applied the principle when he declared himself &#8220;innocent of the blood of all men&#8221; because he had &#8220;proclaimed the whole will of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>). Truth observed must be truth declared&#8212;whether to a besieged Babylon or to a neighbor in spiritual peril.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a> is God&#8217;s straightforward, literal instruction: because He has spoken, Isaiah must act&#8212;placing an alert watchman who will faithfully report incoming judgment. The verse highlights God&#8217;s absolute authority, the immediate obedience He expects, the vital role of vigilant guardianship, and the responsibility to proclaim what is revealed. It reminds every believer that when the Lord speaks, we listen, watch, and speak in turn, confident that His Word is both accurate and sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Go, set a watchman . . .</span>--The prophet is, as it were, placed in vision on a lofty watch-tower, and reports what meets his gaze, or that of the watchman with whom he identifies himself (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm" title="So you, O son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.">Ezekiel 33:7</a>).

The event is not to be immediate, it is to be watched for; and Isaiah is not to watch himself, but to set the watchman. Moreover, the watchman waits long before he sees anything (ver. 8).
