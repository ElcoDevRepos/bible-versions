Historically, the City of David is the oldest settled neighborhood of Jerusalem, named after King David who established it as his capital. The breaches in the walls symbolize the physical and spiritual weaknesses of the city. In the context of Isaiah, this is a time when Jerusalem is under threat, likely from the Assyrian army. The breaches can also be seen as a metaphor for the moral and spiritual decay of the people, as they have turned away from God. This imagery is reminiscent of Nehemiah's later efforts to rebuild Jerusalem's walls, emphasizing the need for both physical and spiritual restoration (<a href="/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13-17</a>).<p><b>You collected water from the lower pool.</b><br>The collection of water from the lower pool indicates a practical response to the impending siege. The lower pool likely refers to the Pool of Siloam, which was part of Jerusalem's water supply system. This action reflects the city's preparation for a siege, ensuring that they have enough resources to withstand an attack. The Pool of Siloam is significant in biblical history, as it is later mentioned in the New Testament when Jesus heals a blind man (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>). The act of collecting water can also symbolize the need for spiritual sustenance and reliance on God, contrasting with the people's focus on their own efforts rather than seeking divine help. This highlights a recurring biblical theme where reliance on God is paramount, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, where God is described as the "spring of living water."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>This refers to Jerusalem, specifically the ancient part of the city that was originally captured by King David.

Judah secured supplies by channeling the Gihon spring to the &#8220;lower pool,&#8221; an engineering feat attributed to Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical preparation is wise (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>), yet Isaiah condemns the attitude behind it: trusting plumbing over Providence. Verse 11 continues, &#8220;but you did not look to Him who made it.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Similar contrasts:<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> &#8211; People &#8220;dug their own cisterns&#8230; broken cisterns that cannot hold water.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a> &#8211; &#8220;In repentance and rest is your salvation&#8230; but you were not willing.&#8221;<p>&#8211; God had offered a better water source&#8212;Himself (<a href="/isaiah/12-3.htm">Isaiah 12:3</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).

Its object was to stop the outflow of the streams, and gather them into a reservoir, partly, of course, for the supply of the inhabitants during the siege, but still more that the Assyrian armies might find little or no water in the immediate neighbourhood of the city.

"The city of David" may be here a name for Jerusalem generally, as "the city where David dwelt" (<a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>), or it may designate the eastern hill, where David fixed his residence (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15, 16, 25</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). In <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> we read that Hezekiah at this time "built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Mille in <span class="accented">the city of David</span>," where a particular part of Jerusalem seems certainly to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</span> The arrangements made by Hezekiah with respect to the water-supply at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, seem to have been the following: He found on the north of the city, where the Assyrian attack was certain to be delivered, in the vicinity of the Damascus gate, a pool or reservoir (<a href="/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>), fed by a conduit from some natural source, which lay open and patent to view. The superfluous water ran off from it by a "brook" (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-4.htm">2 Chronicles 32:4</a>), which passed down the Tyropoeon valley, and joined the Kedron to the southeast of Ophel. His first step was to cover over and conceal the open reservoir, and also the" brook" which ran from it, at least as far as the northern city wall, to prevent their use by the Assyrians. He then further made a conduit underground (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>) within the city, along the Tyropoeon depression, to a second reservoir, or "pool," also within the city, which could be freely used by the inhabitants (see ver. 11; and comp. Ecclus. 48:17). Further, it is probable that he carried a conduit from this second pool, under the temple area, to the" fount of the Virgin" on the eastern side of Ophel, and thence further conveyed the water by a tunnel through Ophel to the "pool of Siloam." (This last may be the work here alluded to.) The inscription recently discovered at this peel is probably of Hezekiah's time (see 'Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for April, 1881, p. 70). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/22-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there were many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;b&#183;b&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">breaches</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;q&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1233.htm">Strong's 1233: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fissure, breach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the walls of the City</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of David.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You collected</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;qab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
