The "breath" of God often symbolizes His spirit or His word, which can bring life or destruction. The "rushing torrent" suggests a force that is unstoppable and all-consuming, similar to the floodwaters described in Genesis. The rising "to the neck" indicates a situation of near-total submersion, symbolizing imminent danger or judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing, where the waters were a means of deliverance for Israel but destruction for the Egyptians. It also parallels the judgment described in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>, where the Assyrian invasion is likened to a flood reaching up to the neck.<p><b>He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction;</b><br>The act of sifting implies separation and judgment. In ancient times, a sieve was used to separate grain from chaff, symbolizing the separation of the righteous from the wicked. This imagery is consistent with God's role as judge over the nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>, where John the Baptist speaks of Jesus winnowing the chaff from the wheat. The "sieve of destruction" indicates that this sifting is not merely for purification but for judgment and punishment. Historically, this reflects the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests, where nations were judged and scattered. It also foreshadows the final judgment, where Christ will separate the sheep from the goats.<p><b>He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray.</b><br>The bridle is a tool used to control and direct animals, particularly horses. Here, it symbolizes God's sovereign control over the nations, even to the point of leading them into judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of God using even the wicked actions of nations to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5-11</a>, where God raises the Babylonians as an instrument of judgment. The phrase "to lead them astray" suggests a judicial hardening, where God allows nations to follow their sinful inclinations to their own destruction, similar to how Pharaoh's heart was hardened in Exodus. This also serves as a warning to Israel and the church to remain faithful, lest they too be led astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, depicted as a powerful force executing judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The collective groups of people subject to God's judgment and sifting.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Isaiah is primarily speaking.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire during Isaiah's time, often seen as an instrument of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is depicted as having ultimate control over the nations, using them as instruments of His will.

Together they underline God&#8217;s ability to press judgment right to the brink of total submersion without losing control.<p>&#8226; The phrase also recalls <a href="/2_samuel/22-16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a>, where &#8220;the channels of the sea were seen&#8230; at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.&#8221; When God exhales, creation feels it.<p>&#8226; For believers this serves as both warning and comfort: warning because no wall&#8212;political, military, or personal&#8212;can dam up His torrent; comfort because the same Lord can halt the waters exactly where He chooses (<a href="/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction</b><p>&#8226; After the flood imagery, Isaiah switches to threshing-floor language. Sifting separates grain from chaff; here the &#8220;grain&#8221; is the remnant that trusts the Lord, while the &#8220;chaff&#8221; is every proud nation or person refusing Him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a> echoes the idea: &#8220;I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations as one sifts with a sieve, yet not a pebble will fall to the ground.&#8221; God&#8217;s sieve is precise; nothing slips through unnoticed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6-7</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a> speak of a final shaking that will leave only what is unshakable. <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a> previews that moment: whole empires tumble like husks, yet God preserves His covenant people.<p>&#8226; This literal &#8220;sieve of destruction&#8221; points ahead to Christ&#8217;s winnowing (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). The Messiah stands ready to clear His threshing floor, gathering wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He bridles the jaws of the peoples to lead them astray</b><p>&#8226; A bridle in the mouth controls direction; here God places it on stubborn nations.

He is not merely reacting to history; He directs it.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a> explains the principle: &#8220;God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.&#8221; When people repeatedly spurn light, God seals their choice, steering them down the very path they insist on taking&#8212;yet still accomplishing His righteous plan.<p>&#8226; The verse is sober reassurance that the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty extends even to the rebellion of the nations.

More incongruity, to be excused by the writer's theme being such as to transcend all language and all imagery. One of the Divine purposes, in all violent crashes and revolutions, is "to sift nations" - <span class="accented">to</span> separate in each nation the good from the bad, the precious from the vile; and this is done with "<span class="accented">the</span> sieve of vanity," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sieve which allows the good corn to pass through, separating from it, and keeping back, all that is vile and refuse (comp. <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</span> Another entire change in the metaphor. The result of God's interference shall be "to put a bridle in the jaws of the <span class="accented">peoples</span>," whereby the hand of the Almighty will guide them to their destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/30-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">His breath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
