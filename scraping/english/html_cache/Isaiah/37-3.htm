It reflects the practice of seeking divine guidance through God's appointed messengers, such as Isaiah, during times of crisis.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Hezekiah says:</b><br>Hezekiah, the king of Judah, is portrayed as a righteous leader who seeks God's intervention. His reliance on God contrasts with the idolatrous practices of other kings. Hezekiah's faithfulness is noted in <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>, where he is described as trusting in the Lord more than any other king of Judah.<p><b>Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace;</b><br>This triad of terms underscores the severity of the situation. "Distress" reflects the immediate threat from the Assyrian army. "Rebuke" suggests divine displeasure, possibly due to past sins or failures. "Disgrace" indicates the shame and humiliation faced by Judah, a theme echoed in <a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>, where Jerusalem's fall is lamented.<p><b>for children have come to the point of birth,</b><br>This metaphor illustrates a critical moment requiring urgent action. It evokes the imagery of labor, a common biblical metaphor for intense struggle and anticipation, as seen in <a href="/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>. The nation is on the brink of a significant event, needing divine intervention to bring it to fruition.<p><b>but there is no strength to deliver them.</b><br>The lack of strength signifies Judah's helplessness against Assyria. It highlights human limitations and the need for God's power, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in human might with reliance on the Lord.
