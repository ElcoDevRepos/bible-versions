In ancient Near Eastern culture, barrenness was often seen as a curse or a sign of divine disfavor. However, God is reversing this perception, promising a future of abundance and blessing. This imagery also connects to the story of Sarah, Abraham's wife, who was barren before God fulfilled His promise of a son, Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-3</a>). The call to "shout for joy" signifies a prophetic assurance of restoration and divine intervention.<p><b>break forth in song and cry aloud, you who have never travailed;</b><br>The command to "break forth in song" and "cry aloud" emphasizes a spontaneous and overwhelming expression of joy. The term "travailed" refers to the labor pains of childbirth, which the barren woman has never experienced. This highlights the miraculous nature of the promised transformation. The imagery of singing and crying aloud is often associated with deliverance and victory in the Bible, as seen in the songs of Moses and Miriam after the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 15).<p><b>because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband,&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals a divine paradox: the desolate woman, representing Israel, will have more children than the one who is married. This prophecy points to a future expansion and blessing that defies human expectations. It echoes the promise made to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The Apostle Paul references this verse in <a href="/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a>, applying it to the spiritual children of the "Jerusalem above," indicating the growth of the Church and the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant family.<p><b>says the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "says the LORD" underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is a divine declaration, assuring the fulfillment of God's promises. Throughout the Bible, when God speaks, His words are powerful and effective, as seen in the creation narrative (Genesis 1) and the prophetic declarations throughout Scripture. This assurance from the LORD provides hope and confidence to the exiled Israelites, affirming that their future is secure in His hands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barren_woman.htm">Barren Woman</a></b><br>Represents Israel in exile, symbolizing desolation and lack of fruitfulness.

Israel in captivity is addressed as "barren," because, in the time of suffering, her numbers rather diminished than increased.

She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5).
