It is often made from coarse goat's hair, symbolizing humility and distress. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a> when Jacob mourns for Joseph. The use of sackcloth in the streets indicates a public display of grief, suggesting a communal or national calamity. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>, this mourning is for the impending judgment on Moab, a neighboring nation of Israel.<p><b>on the rooftops and in the public squares</b><br>Rooftops in ancient Near Eastern cultures were flat and often used as additional living spaces. Public squares were central places for community gatherings and commerce. The mention of both locations highlights the widespread nature of the lamentation, affecting all aspects of daily life. This public mourning signifies the depth of the crisis, as both private and communal spaces are filled with expressions of sorrow. The rooftops and squares being filled with mourners also reflect the cultural practice of lamenting in visible, communal settings, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/48-38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a>.<p><b>they all wail, falling down weeping.</b><br>The act of wailing and falling down weeping is a vivid depiction of intense grief and despair. This response is not just individual but collective, indicating a shared experience of suffering. The physical act of falling down weeping underscores the overwhelming nature of the sorrow, possibly due to the destruction and loss prophesied against Moab. This imagery is consistent with other biblical descriptions of lamentation, such as in <a href="/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, where the elders of Zion sit on the ground in silence, wearing sackcloth and throwing dust on their heads. The communal aspect of this mourning can also be seen as a type of the ultimate sorrow and repentance that leads to redemption, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation east of Israel, often in conflict with Israel. <a href="/bsb/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a> is a prophecy concerning Moab's impending judgment and destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/streets_and_public_squares.htm">Streets and Public Squares</a></b><br>These are the communal areas of Moab where public life and commerce occur, now turned into places of mourning.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rooftops.htm">Rooftops</a></b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, rooftops were often used as additional living spaces.

The mourning is not hidden inside houses; it fills the community&#8217;s daily paths.<p>- Similar scenes appear when judgment or calamity comes&#8212;&#8220;Judah mourns and her gates languish; they sit on the ground in mourning&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>).<p>- When God&#8217;s warning becomes reality, ordinary life pauses. What once bustled with commerce now echoes with lament, underscoring how completely divine judgment interrupts human routines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They wear sackcloth</b><p>- Sackcloth was rough goat hair, a physical reminder of inner anguish. By donning it, the Moabites confess that their comfort has been stripped away.<p>- From Nineveh&#8217;s king to its cattle (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5&#8211;8</a>) and Hezekiah in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>), sackcloth consistently signals humility before God.<p>- The attire points to a larger truth: external sorrow should match genuine heart repentance (<a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the rooftops and in the public squares</b><p>- Flat roofs served as social spaces; now they become platforms for lament. Public squares, meant for trade, turn into open-air chapels of grief.<p>- Jeremiah uses identical language regarding Moab: &#8220;On all the rooftops of Moab and in its public squares there is nothing but mourning&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-38.htm">Jeremiah 48:38</a>).<p>- The widespread location of their weeping shows that no corner of the nation escapes the fallout of sin and pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They all wail</b><p>- The word &#8220;all&#8221; stresses corporate anguish. Nobody can claim exemption; leaders and laborers alike join the outcry.<p>- Prophets often portray communal wailing when God&#8217;s hand is heavy: &#8220;I will wail like the jackals and mourn like ostriches&#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>).<p>- Collective lament testifies that God judges peoples, not just individuals, when rebellion becomes a shared way of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Falling down weeping</b><p>- Their grief culminates in collapse. Strength gives way under the weight of divine displeasure&#8212;&#8220;David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-4.htm">1 Samuel 30:4</a>).<p>- Prostration is also an admission of helplessness; nothing in Moab can stop the prophesied devastation.<p>- Jesus Himself wept over an unrepentant city (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), reminding us that tears alone are not repentance unless they lead to turning back to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of Moab&#8217;s future sorrow: grief saturates every street; sackcloth replaces fine clothes; rooftops and market squares echo with unified wails; the people collapse in tears.
