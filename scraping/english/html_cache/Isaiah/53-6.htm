In biblical times, sheep were a common part of agrarian life, and their behavior was well understood by the audience. The metaphor highlights human nature's inclination to deviate from God's path. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges straying like a lost sheep. The imagery underscores the need for divine guidance and the role of God as the shepherd, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>.<p><b>each one has turned to his own way;</b><br>This part emphasizes individual responsibility and the universal nature of sin. It reflects the human tendency to pursue personal desires and self-interest, often in opposition to God's will. This idea is consistent with the narrative of the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where Adam and Eve chose their own way over God's command. The phrase also aligns with <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which warns that a way that seems right to a person can lead to death, highlighting the peril of self-directed paths.<p><b>and the LORD has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all.</b><br>This statement is a prophetic reference to the atoning work of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The concept of substitutionary atonement is central here, where the sins of humanity are placed upon Christ, fulfilling the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus. This act of bearing iniquity is further explained in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, where Christ is described as being made sin for us. The phrase underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the redemptive plan of God through Jesus, as also seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, which speaks of Christ bearing our sins in His body on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolically represents humanity in its tendency to stray from God's path, highlighting our vulnerability and need for guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, who orchestrates the redemptive plan for humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/him.htm">Him</a></b><br>Refers to the Suffering Servant, understood in Christian theology as a prophecy about Jesus Christ, who bears the sins of humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>Represents the sin and moral failings of humanity that are placed upon the Suffering Servant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered this message, providing a vision of the coming Messiah and His sacrificial role.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_sin.htm">The Universality of Sin</a></b><br>Recognize that all humanity is prone to stray from God's path, emphasizing the need for a Savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_substitutionary_atonement.htm">The Substitutionary Atonement</a></b><br>Understand that Jesus took upon Himself the sins of the world, fulfilling the prophecy of the Suffering Servant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_redemptive_plan.htm">God's Redemptive Plan</a></b><br>Appreciate the depth of God's love and His plan for redemption through Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Encourage self-examination of ways we may have turned to our own paths and the need to return to God's way.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_gratitude.htm">Living in Gratitude</a></b><br>Live a life of gratitude and obedience in response to the sacrifice made on our behalf.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_53_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 53:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_6_Why_need_Jesus_sacrifice.htm">How does Isaiah 53:6 illustrate humanity's need for Jesus' redemptive sacrifice?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_own_way_reveal_about_us.htm">What does "each has turned to his own way" reveal about human nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_53_6_to_lost_sheep_parable.htm">How does Isaiah 53:6 connect with the parable of the lost sheep?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_seek_God_s_forgiveness.htm">In what ways can we acknowledge our "iniquity" and seek God's forgiveness daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_6_Inspire_gospel_sharing.htm">How can Isaiah 53:6 inspire us to share the gospel with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_6_s_link_to_sin_redemption.htm">How does Isaiah 53:6 relate to the concept of sin and redemption in Christianity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Isaiah_53_6_linked_to_Jesus.htm">Why is Isaiah 53:6 considered a prophecy about Jesus in Christian theology?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_53_6_fulfilled_in_NT_evidence.htm">What historical evidence supports the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:6 in the New Testament?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_53.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'all_we_like_sheep_gone_astray'.htm">What does "All we like sheep have gone astray" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/when_was_nehemiah_written.htm">What does it mean Jesus became sin for us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_value_the_lost_and_found.htm">How does God value the lost and found?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/have_all_people_committed_sins.htm">Have all people committed sins?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 53:6 Mean</div><b>We all like sheep have gone astray</b><p>The prophet opens with a vivid picture everyone can grasp.

So St. John says that the Father "sent the Son to be the Propitiation for our sins" (<a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). And St. Paul tells us that God (the Father) "made him to be sin for us who knew no sin" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).
