It is a common prophetic formula that underscores the direct communication from God to His people through the prophet Isaiah. This establishes the importance and reliability of the subsequent message.<p><b>The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush,</b><br>Egypt and Cush (modern-day Sudan) were known for their wealth and trade goods. Egypt was a powerful and influential nation, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and prosperity. Cush, located south of Egypt, was also known for its riches and resources. This phrase suggests a transfer of wealth and influence, indicating a future where these nations recognize the supremacy of God's people.<p><b>along with the Sabeans, men of stature,</b><br>The Sabeans were a people from the region of Sheba, possibly in modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia. Known for their wealth and trade, they are described as "men of stature," indicating their prominence and influence. This highlights the far-reaching impact of God's plan, extending beyond immediate neighbors to distant lands.<p><b>will come over to you and will be yours;</b><br>This signifies a future submission and alliance, where these powerful nations acknowledge the authority and blessing of God's people. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, where other nations recognize their unique relationship with the divine.<p><b>they will trudge behind you;</b><br>The imagery of trudging suggests a reluctant yet inevitable submission. It conveys the idea of these nations following the lead of God's people, acknowledging their superior spiritual status and the truth of their God.<p><b>they will come over in chains and bow down to you.</b><br>Chains symbolize captivity or subjugation, but in a spiritual sense, it may indicate a willing submission to God's authority. Bowing down reflects reverence and acknowledgment of a higher power, suggesting a recognition of the true God by these nations.<p><b>They will confess to you: &#8216;God is indeed with you,</b><br>This confession is a powerful acknowledgment of God's presence and favor with His people. It echoes the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the visible evidence of His blessing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>, where God's presence with Joseph is recognized by others.<p><b>and there is no other; there is no other God.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This declaration affirms the monotheistic belief central to the faith of Israel. It underscores the uniqueness and supremacy of the God of Israel, rejecting the existence or power of any other deities. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty and the call for all nations to recognize Him as the one true God, as seen in passages like <a

In <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm" title="For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.">Isaiah 43:3</a>, Egypt, Ethiopia, Seba, had been given to Cyrus, as a reward, or ransom, for the deliverance of Israel. Here the prophet goes a step farther, and contemplates them as coming, in the spirit of a voluntary surrender, as proselytes to the faith of Israel, in self-imposed bondage, offering to Israel, as one with God, the "supplication" which, elsewhere, is offered to Jehovah. The promise reminds us of <a href="/psalms/68-31.htm" title="Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God.">Psalm 68:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm" title="The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.">Psalm 72:10</a>, and yet more of <a href="/isaiah/19-23.htm" title="In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.">Isaiah 19:23</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5-7</a>. A partial fulfilment may have been found in the command given by Cyrus, that these and other nations should assist in the work of rebuilding the Temple (<a href="/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>). Egypt and Ethiopia send the products of their labour. The Sabaeans (<span class= "ital">sc. </span>the people of Meroe), strong, but not wealthy, come freely to offer their own labour. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/45.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-25.</span> - THE CONVERSION' OF THE GENTILES A CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESTORATION AND SALVATION OF ISRAEL. "With the prospect of the release of the exiles is associated," says Delitzsch, "in the prophet's perspective, the prospect of an expansion of the restored Church, through the entrance of the fulness of the Gentiles." Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are especially mentioned here, as in <a href="/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>, as among the first to come in (vers. 14, 15). Later on, a more general influx is spoken of (ver. 20); and, finally, a prospect is held out of an ultimate universal conversion (ver. 23). At the same time, judgment is denounced against the idolaters who persist in their idolatry (vers. 16, 20), and they are warned that they will have no share in the coming glories of the Israel of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The labour of Egypt</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabaeans</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the laborious Egyptians, and the traffic-loving Ethiopians and Sabaeans."

Knobel understands that they would give their aid to the rebuilding of the temple; but this they certainly did not do, and Isaiah's words certainly do not imply it. He is again speaking of the great conversion of the nations, which he connected with the restoration of the Jews to their own land (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18-25</a>, etc.), and which may be considered to have begun then, but only to have had its full accomplishment in the Messianic period. <span class="cmt_word">In chains they shall come over</span>.
