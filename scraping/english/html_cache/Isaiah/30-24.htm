Oxen were used for plowing fields, while donkeys were valuable for carrying loads. This phrase highlights the prosperity and abundance that God promises to His people, as even the animals that labor will be well-provided for. The use of these animals is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, which instructs not to plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together, emphasizing the importance of order and harmony in God's creation.<p><b>will eat salted fodder</b><br>Salted fodder indicates a level of care and provision beyond the ordinary. In the ancient Near East, adding salt to fodder was a way to preserve and enhance the feed, ensuring the animals received the best nutrition. This reflects God's abundant provision and blessing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides for all needs. The use of salt also has covenantal significance, as salt was used in offerings (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), symbolizing purity and preservation.<p><b>winnowed with shovel and pitchfork</b><br>Winnowing is the process of separating grain from chaff, a common agricultural practice in biblical times. The mention of shovel and pitchfork suggests a thorough and careful preparation of the fodder, ensuring that the animals receive only the best. This imagery can be connected to the spiritual process of refinement and purification, as seen in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>, where John the Baptist speaks of Jesus winnowing His threshing floor.
