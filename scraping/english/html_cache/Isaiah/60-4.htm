In the context of Isaiah, it is an invitation to witness the fulfillment of God's promises. The imagery of lifting one's eyes suggests a shift from despair to hope, encouraging the people to see beyond their current circumstances. Biblically, this echoes other calls to look and see God's work, such as in <a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-15</a>, where God tells Abraham to look around at the land promised to him.<p><b>They all gather and come to you:</b><br>This indicates a future ingathering of people, symbolizing the return of the exiles to Jerusalem. Historically, this reflects the return from Babylonian captivity, but prophetically, it points to a greater eschatological gathering of nations to the light of God's presence. This gathering is also seen in the New Testament, where people from all nations are drawn to Christ (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>).<p><b>Your sons will come from afar:</b><br>The return of sons from distant lands signifies the restoration of family and community. It highlights the reversal of previous dispersions and captivities. This can be seen as a type of the prodigal son returning home (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), symbolizing repentance and restoration. It also foreshadows the gathering of God's people from all corners of the earth in the end times (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p><b>And your daughters will be carried on the arm:</b><br>This phrase suggests care, protection, and tenderness. Daughters being carried implies a nurturing return, emphasizing the safety and security found in God's restoration. Culturally, it reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of carrying children, symbolizing familial love and support. This imagery can be connected to God's promise of comfort and care for His people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-12.htm">Isaiah 66:12-13</a>, where God comforts Jerusalem as a mother comforts her child.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of focus in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60</a>, representing the city of God and His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Symbolic of the people of Israel returning to their homeland, representing restoration and reunion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who witness and participate in the gathering and restoration of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The orchestrator of the gathering, fulfilling His promises to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, and He will restore His people.
