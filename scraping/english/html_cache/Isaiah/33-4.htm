In the ancient Near East, locust swarms were a common and devastating natural disaster, consuming everything in their path. This imagery is used to convey the thoroughness and inevitability of the spoil being taken. The context here is the judgment of God upon the nations that have opposed His people, Israel. The locust imagery is also reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>), where locusts were a sign of divine judgment. This phrase underscores the futility of the nations' resistance against God's will, as their riches are effortlessly gathered by others.<p><b>like a swarm of locusts men sweep over it.</b><br>The comparison to a swarm of locusts emphasizes the overwhelming and unstoppable nature of the invading force. Historically, this can be seen as a reference to the Assyrian or Babylonian invasions, where armies would sweep through lands, leaving destruction in their wake. The cultural context of the time would have made this imagery particularly vivid and terrifying, as locust swarms could strip a land bare, leaving famine and desolation. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of divine retribution and the sovereignty of God over the nations. In a prophetic sense, it can be seen as a type of the final judgment, where all earthly powers are subdued before the coming of God's kingdom. The imagery of locusts is also used in the book of Joel (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4, 2</a>:25) to describe both literal and metaphorical invasions, further linking this passage to the theme of divine judgment and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem during a time of political turmoil and impending judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, facing threats from surrounding nations and internal corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire during Isaiah's time, often seen as an instrument of God's judgment against Israel and Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts.htm">Locusts</a></b><br>In the ancient Near East, locusts were a symbol of destruction and overwhelming force, often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe invading armies or divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spoil.htm">Spoil</a></b><br>Refers to the plunder or goods taken by force, often in the context of war or conquest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Just as locusts swarm and consume everything in their path, God's judgment is thorough and unavoidable.

In the historical narrative (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>) nothing is said of it; but, beyond a doubt, when the host was to a largo extent destroyed, and the remainder fled, there must have been an enormous booty left behind, which the enemies of the Assyrians would naturally seize. A further spoiling of the fugitives probably followed; and, the <span class="accented">prestige</span> of the great king being gone, marauding bands would probably on all sides ravage the Assyrian territory. <span class="cmt_word">Like the gathering of the caterpillar</span>.
