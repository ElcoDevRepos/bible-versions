In the context of Isaiah, this prophecy is directed towards Judah and Jerusalem, warning them of the consequences of their rebellion against God. The oppression among the people signifies a departure from the covenantal laws given to Israel, which emphasized justice and care for one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). This internal strife can be seen as a judgment from God, allowing the natural consequences of sin to manifest in societal collapse.<p><b>man against man, neighbor against neighbor</b><br>This highlights the pervasive nature of the conflict, affecting all levels of relationships. The repetition emphasizes the universality of the discord, suggesting that no one is immune to the effects of the nation's sin. This mirrors the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God's commandments would lead to internal strife and division. The breakdown of community and familial bonds is a direct result of turning away from God's statutes, which were designed to promote harmony and peace among His people.<p><b>the young will rise up against the old</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of the natural order and respect traditionally given to elders. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, elders were revered for their wisdom and experience. The rebellion of the young against the old signifies a loss of respect for authority and tradition, which is a symptom of deeper spiritual and moral decay. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings in <a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>, where respect for the elderly is commanded. The societal upheaval reflects a broader theme in Isaiah of judgment leading to a complete overturning of established norms.<p><b>and the base against the honorable</b><br>This final phrase underscores the complete inversion of societal values, where those who are morally corrupt or of low status challenge and overthrow those who are honorable and virtuous. This reflects a time when righteousness is no longer valued, and wickedness prevails. The book of Proverbs often contrasts the wise and the foolish, the righteous and the wicked, highlighting the consequences of living contrary to God's wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). This inversion is a sign of God's judgment, allowing the natural consequences of sin to bring about disorder and chaos.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings in Judah.
