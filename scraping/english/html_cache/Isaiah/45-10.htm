In the context of Isaiah, it serves as a warning against questioning God's authority and purpose. The father in this phrase symbolizes God as the Creator, reflecting the biblical theme of God as the Father of all creation (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of honoring one's parents, a commandment deeply rooted in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p><b>&#8216;What have you begotten?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the father's role in creation, symbolizing a lack of respect and understanding of the divine order. In biblical times, questioning a father's actions would be seen as disrespectful and rebellious. Theologically, it reflects humanity's tendency to question God's plans and purposes, reminiscent of Job's questioning of God (Job 38-41). It highlights the need for humility and trust in God's sovereign will.<p><b>or to his mother,</b><br>The mother here represents the nurturing aspect of creation, often associated with the earth or the nation of Israel. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the mother was revered for her role in bringing forth life. This phrase emphasizes the importance of respecting the natural order and the roles established by God. It also alludes to the spiritual motherhood of the Church, which brings forth believers in faith (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>).<p><b>&#8216;What have you brought forth?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This question mirrors the previous one, further emphasizing the folly of questioning the processes and outcomes ordained by God. It suggests a lack of gratitude and recognition for the gift of life. Biblically, it can be connected to the creation narrative where God saw all that He had made and declared it "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). This phrase calls believers to trust in God's wisdom and to accept His creation with reverence and gratitude.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
