The expression of joy in the LORD is a common theme in the Psalms and other prophetic writings, highlighting a personal and communal relationship with God. This joy is rooted in the recognition of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/32-11.htm">Psalm 32:11</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>.<p><b>my soul will exult in my God</b><br>The soul's exultation signifies an inner, profound delight and satisfaction in God. This reflects a holistic worship that involves the entire being, not just outward expressions. The use of "my God" indicates a personal relationship, echoing the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>.<p><b>for He has clothed me with garments of salvation</b><br>The imagery of clothing with salvation suggests a transformation and covering of sin, akin to the atonement rituals in the Old Testament. Garments symbolize identity and status; thus, being clothed in salvation indicates a new identity as one redeemed and justified. This connects to the New Testament concept of being clothed with Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>.<p><b>and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness</b><br>The robe of righteousness signifies being enveloped in God's moral and ethical standards, imparted to the believer. This righteousness is not self-derived but granted by God, aligning with the doctrine of imputed righteousness found in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>. The robe also signifies honor and dignity, reminiscent of the prodigal son's reception in <a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22</a>.<p><b>as a bridegroom wears a priestly headdress</b><br>The comparison to a bridegroom wearing a priestly headdress highlights the celebratory and sacred nature of the occasion. In ancient Israel, the priestly headdress was a symbol of holiness and service to God, as described in <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-39</a>. This imagery suggests a dual role of the believer as both a participant in a divine covenant and a servant in God's kingdom.<p><b>as a bride adorns herself with her jewels</b><br>The adornment of a bride with jewels signifies beauty, value, and preparation for a significant union. This imagery is often used in Scripture to describe the relationship between God and His people, such as in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where the New Jerusalem is prepared as a bride. It underscores the intimate and cherished relationship between God and the redeemed, reflecting the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the source of salvation and righteousness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Symbolic of Christ, who is often depicted as the bridegroom in the New Testament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Represents the people of God, often symbolizing the Church in the New Testament.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/garments_of_salvation_and_robe_of_righteousness.htm">Garments of Salvation and Robe of Righteousness</a></b><br>Metaphors for the spiritual transformation and redemption provided by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_salvation.htm">Joy in Salvation</a></b><br>Emphasize the profound joy and gratitude that should accompany the realization of God's salvation.<br><br>Encourage believers to express their joy in worship and daily life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Highlight the transformation from sin to righteousness through Christ.<br><br>Encourage believers to embrace their new identity and live accordingly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_clothing.htm">Symbolism of Clothing</a></b><br>Discuss the significance of being clothed in salvation and righteousness.<br><br>Encourage believers to "put on" Christ in their daily actions and decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_church_as_the_bride.htm">Role of the Church as the Bride</a></b><br>Explore the Church's role as the bride of Christ, called to purity and faithfulness.<br><br>Encourage communal and individual preparation for the return of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_role_of_believers.htm">Priestly Role of Believers</a></b><br>Reflect on the priestly imagery and the call to live as a holy priesthood.<br><br>Encourage believers to intercede for others and live lives of service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_61_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 61:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_61_10_inspire_gratitude.htm">How does Isaiah 61:10 inspire gratitude for God's salvation in your life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_garments_of_salvation.htm">What does "garments of salvation" symbolize in Isaiah 61:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_61_10_Ephesians_6_14_link.htm">How does Isaiah 61:10 connect with Ephesians 6:14 on righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_rejoice_in_the_LORD_3.htm">How can you "rejoice greatly in the LORD" daily, as Isaiah 61:10 suggests?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_you_show_God_s_righteousness_today.htm">In what ways can you reflect God's righteousness in your community today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_61_10_on_salvation_righteousness.htm">How does Isaiah 61:10 reflect the concept of divine salvation and righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Isaiah_61_10.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Isaiah 61:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_61_10_s_link_to_salvation_joy.htm">How does Isaiah 61:10 relate to the theme of joy in salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_61.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 61?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_nudity_allowed_in_heaven.htm">Is nudity allowed in heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'stand_fast_in_faith'_mean.htm">What are Garments of Skin in biblical context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/fate_of_righteous_and_wicked.htm">What will happen to the righteous and the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_'foreign_attire'_in_zephaniah_1_8_historical.htm">In Zephaniah 1:8, what evidence exists, if any, for the identity of &#8220;foreign attire,&#8221; and can this cultural reference be authenticated historically?

Our filthy rags are gone; we stand honored, loved, and radiant, like a bride and groom on their wedding day. This verse invites continual, soul-deep celebration of the finished, flawless work God has done for us and in us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/61.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">I will greatly rejoice . . .</span>--The speaker is again, as in <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>, the ideal Servant of Jehovah, who identifies himself with the people and slaves. The Targum, it may be noted, makes Jerusalem the speaker.<p><span class= "bld">The garments of salvation . . .</span>--The imagery is the same as that of <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm" title="For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.">Isaiah 59:17</a> and <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm" title="To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.">Isaiah 61:3</a>, its entirely spiritual significance being, perhaps, still more strongly accentuated.<p><span class= "bld">As a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">wears a turban </span>(or <span class= "ital">mitre</span>)<span class= "ital">, as a priest. </span>It would appear from Song <a href="/songs/3-11.htm" title="Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.">Song of Solomon 3:11</a> that bridegrooms wore a special head-dress on the day of their espousal, and this is here compared to the priestly "bonnet," or "mitre" (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm" title="And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.">Exodus 28:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/39-28.htm" title="And a turban of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,">Exodus 39:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-18.htm" title="They shall have linen bonnets on their heads, and shall have linen breeches on their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causes sweat.">Ezekiel 44:18</a>). On the special occasion which may have suggested the image, see Note on <a href="/isaiah/62-4.htm" title="You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.">Isaiah 62:4</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/61.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - JERUSALEM ACCEPTS THE PROMISES, AND GLORIES IN JEHOVAH. So the Targum and Rosenmuller. Others think that "the Servant" is still speaking, or that Isaiah speaks in the name of the people. To us the exposition of the Targum appears the most satisfactory. It is in the manner of Isaiah suddenly to introduce a new speaker. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>). The promises made were such as naturally to call forth on the part of Israel the most heartfelt joy and rejoicing - including, as they did, restoration, rule over the Gentiles, a universal priesthood, a wide territory, "everlasting joy," a high renown, and an "everlasting covenant<span class="cmt_word">. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a> and Isaiah 61:3). The metaphor occurs also in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>). God clothes Israel with "righteousness" derived from himself (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>), and then with its natural consequence - "salvation." The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/61-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will rejoice greatly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7797.htm">Strong's 7797: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bright, cheerful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
