It reflects the prophetic tradition where God calls His people to heed His words. This echoes the call to listen found throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, emphasizing the importance of hearing and obeying God's voice.<p><b>From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;</b><br>This statement highlights God's transparency and faithfulness in revealing His plans and purposes. It contrasts with the practices of pagan deities, who often communicated through secretive and mysterious means. This openness is consistent with God's nature as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where He reveals His plans to His prophets.<p><b>from the time it happened, I was there.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores God's omnipresence and sovereignty throughout history. It affirms that God is not only aware of events but actively involved in them. This is reminiscent of God's presence in creation (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1-2</a>) and His ongoing involvement in the affairs of the world.<p><b>And now the Lord GOD has sent me,</b><br>Here, the speaker identifies themselves as being sent by the Lord GOD, indicating a divine commission. This is a common theme in the prophetic literature, where prophets are sent by God to deliver His messages (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). This also foreshadows the sending of Jesus Christ, who was sent by the Father (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>).<p><b>accompanied by His Spirit.</b><br>The mention of the Spirit signifies divine empowerment and guidance. The Spirit's role in the Old Testament includes inspiring prophets and enabling them to carry out their missions (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>). This also prefigures the New Testament understanding of the Holy Spirit's work in the life of Jesus (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>) and the early church (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is delivering God's message to the people of Israel.

At first Jehovah appears as the speaker, and as using much the same language as before. At the close the prophet appears abruptly, as speaking in his own person. Perhaps, indeed, the prophet is the speaker throughout. A paraphrase will perhaps help to explain the sequence of thought. "I have not from the beginning of my prophetic work spoken in dark, ambiguous speeches like the oracles of the heathen. From the time that the great work began to unfold itself I was present, contemplating it. Now the time of revelation has come. <span class= "ital">The Lord God hath sent </span>me (this is the Hebrew order); <span class= "ital">and His Spirit. </span>This gives, it is believed, an adequate explanation.

Israel is reminded of God's merciful teaching and leading in the past (vers. 16, 17); expostulated with on their disobedience (vers. 18, 19); exhorted to go forth boldly and joyfully from Babylon (vers. 20, 21); and finally warned that God's blessings - even such a blessing as deliverance - are no blessings to any but the righteous (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not spoken in secret from the beginning</span>. God, "from the beginning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his first dealings with Israel, had raised up a succession of prophets, who had declared his will, not "in secret," or ambiguously, but openly and plainly, so that all who heard might understand (comp. <a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, and see the comment ad <span class="accented">loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">From the time that it was, there am I</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from the time that the earth was, there (in the succession of my prophetic messengers) was I."

Dr. Kay supposes that "one Divine Personage is here sent by another" - the Second Person of the Holy Trinity by the First and by the Third; but it is against the analogy of faith that the Third Person should send the Second. Probably Mr. Cheyne is right in suggesting that "here a fresh speaker is introduced," and also right in his supposition that the fresh speaker is "the prophet himself," who tells us that he is now carrying on the goodly succession which has been "from the beginning," and is sent to deliver his message by God (the Father) and his (Holy) Spirit. On the tendency of Isaiah to "hypostatize" the Spirit of God, see the comment on Isaiah 40:13; and compare Mr. Cheyne's note on the same passage ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 243). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/48-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Come near</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(qir&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7126.htm">Strong's 7126: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come near, approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
