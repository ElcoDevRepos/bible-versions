The new shoot of the fallen tree of Jesse is to grow up like a stately palm, seen afar off upon the heights of the "holy mountain," a signal round which the distant nations might rally as their centre. So the name of "the root of David" is applied to the glorified Christ in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm" title="And one of the elders said to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.">Revelation 5:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-16.htm" title="I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches.

It is characteristic of "the evangelical prophet" that he dwells earnestly and frequently on the calling of the Gentiles (see <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/19-22.htm">Isaiah 19:22-25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>, etc.).

But the idea had taken little hold upon the chosen people generally; and was practically new to them when Isaiah was inspired to preach it afresh. To render it the more palatable, he unites with it the promise of a great gathering of the dispersed Israelites from all quarters to the banner of Messiah, when it is set up. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall he a root of Jesse</span>. The "root" of this place is the same as the "rod" and "branch" of ver. 1.

The Acts and Epistles show how speedily this prophecy was fulfilled. Greeks, Romans, Galatians, Cappadoeians, Babylonians (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>), saw the ensign, and sought to it. <span class="cmt_word">His rest shall be glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his resting-place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Church, with which he abides forever (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The Shechinah of his presence makes the Church "glorious" (literally, "a glory") throughout all ages; but the glory will not fully appear till the time of the "new heavens and new earth" (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; Roy. 21, 22.), when he will dwell visibly with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
