In biblical context, the heart often represents the center of thought and will. The failure to consider in one's heart indicates a deep-seated ignorance or refusal to acknowledge the truth. This echoes the theme of spiritual dullness found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which speaks of the deceitfulness of the heart.<p><b>no one has the knowledge or insight to say</b><br>The absence of knowledge or insight suggests a willful ignorance or a lack of divine wisdom. In <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, the fear of the Lord is described as the beginning of knowledge, implying that true understanding comes from a relationship with God. The people&#8217;s inability to recognize their folly is a result of turning away from God&#8217;s wisdom.<p><b>&#8220;I burned half of it in the fire,</b><br>This refers to the practice of using wood for both practical and idolatrous purposes. Historically, wood was a common resource in ancient Near Eastern cultures, used for fuel, construction, and crafting idols. The absurdity of using the same material for mundane and sacred purposes underscores the irrationality of idol worship.<p><b>and I baked bread on its coals;</b><br>Baking bread on coals was a typical method of cooking in ancient times. This phrase emphasizes the everyday use of wood, contrasting it with the sacredness falsely attributed to idols. The mundane act of baking bread highlights the foolishness of attributing divine power to the same material.<p><b>I roasted meat and I ate.</b><br>Roasting meat was a common practice, often associated with feasts and offerings. This phrase may allude to the sacrificial system, where meat was roasted as part of worship. However, here it underscores the irony of using the same wood for sustenance and idolatry, pointing to the inconsistency in the people's actions.<p><b>Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it?</b><br>The term "detestable" is often used in the Bible to describe idolatry (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>). This rhetorical question highlights the absurdity and offensiveness of idol-making. It calls to mind the first and second commandments, which prohibit the making and worship of idols (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>Shall I bow down to a block of wood?&#8221;</b><br>Bowing down signifies worship and submission, actions that should be directed towards God alone. The phrase "block of wood" diminishes the idol to its basic, worthless form, emphasizing the folly of idol worship. This critique of idolatry is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which mock the lifelessness of idols. The passage ultimately points to the need for true worship of the living God, foreshadowing the coming of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of God and calls for worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

When the heart refuses reflection, it drifts into error. <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a> urges, &#8220;Guard your heart with all diligence,&#8221; yet here the heart is unguarded. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> warns that the heart is deceitful; <a href="/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a> shows how a dull heart blocks repentance.

The idol-maker forgets this simple fact the moment he turns the remaining half into a god.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and I ate.</b><p>The wood&#8217;s true role&#8212;serving human need&#8212;could have reminded them of the Creator who &#8220;gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>). Instead, the idolater consumes the blessing and ignores the Benefactor. <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a> captures the pattern: &#8220;When they were satisfied, they became proud; therefore they forgot Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it?</b><p>The folly now stands exposed. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a> calls idols &#8220;detestable,&#8221; the same word echoed here. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a> pleads, &#8220;Flee from idolatry,&#8221; because it provokes the Lord&#8217;s jealousy (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>). Turning useful wood into an object of worship insults the holy God who alone is worthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shall I bow down to a block of wood?</b><p>The climax is absurdity: worshipping a created thing. <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> mocks idols with mouths that cannot speak; <a href="/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a> asks, &#8220;Can it give guidance?&#8221; <a href="/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a> drives the point home&#8212;God cannot be represented by &#8220;gold or silver or stone, an image formed by man&#8217;s skill and imagination.&#8221; Kneeling before wood reverses creation&#8217;s order: the steward bows to the stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/44-19.htm">Isaiah 44:19</a> unmasks idolatry as irrational, rooted in an unexamined heart and a darkened mind. Wood meant for warmth and cooking becomes an object of devotion when people refuse to acknowledge the Creator. Scripture consistently links this blindness to a hardened heart and warns that worship belongs to God alone. The verse calls every believer to keep the heart soft, the mind clear, and worship firmly fixed on the living Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">None considereth in his heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">recalls it to his heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> returns to a sound way of thinking upon the subject.
