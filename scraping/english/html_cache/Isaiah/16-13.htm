In the context of biblical prophecy, a "message" often refers to a revelation from God delivered through a prophet. Prophets served as God's mouthpieces, conveying His will and intentions to the people.<p><b>that the LORD spoke</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the Hebrew name Yahweh, the covenant name of God. This emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the message. The phrase underscores that the prophecy is not of human origin but is a direct communication from God, highlighting the seriousness and certainty of the message.<p><b>earlier</b><br>This indicates that the message was previously given, suggesting continuity and consistency in God's communication. It implies that the prophecy concerning Moab is not new but a reiteration or reminder of what has already been declared. This can be seen as a testament to God's unchanging nature and His faithfulness to His word.<p><b>concerning Moab</b><br>Moab was a neighboring nation to Israel, located east of the Dead Sea. Historically, Moab had a complex relationship with Israel, often characterized by conflict and tension. The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, which adds a familial dimension to their interactions with Israel. In biblical prophecy, Moab often symbolizes pride and opposition to God's people. The mention of Moab here connects to earlier prophecies in Isaiah and other books, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where Moab's judgment is pronounced due to their arrogance and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Isaiah pauses to mark the close of a prophecy and the start of a short reflection on it, drawing the listeners&#8217; attention to what has already been laid out in <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1&#8211;16</a>:12.<p>&#8211; By saying &#8220;this,&#8221; he points to a specific, complete oracle rather than a vague impression&#8212;just as other prophets identify distinct burdens (<a href="/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The focus on a single, cohesive &#8220;message&#8221; underlines the unity of God&#8217;s word: His counsel is not fragmented or contradictory (<a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD spoke</b><p>&#8211; The authority behind every prophetic utterance is the LORD Himself, not Isaiah&#8217;s private insight (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Because the same LORD who promises redemption also pronounces judgment, the oracle carries absolute certainty (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>&#8211; When God speaks, what He says is as sure as if it were already accomplished (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>earlier concerning Moab</b><p>&#8211;

Moab, Israel&#8217;s neighbor and frequent antagonist (<a href="/bsb/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>), receives a measured judgment: God tracks national pride and cruelty just as He does individual sin (<a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29-30</a>;

The verse affirms that the solemn warning about Moab&#8217;s downfall is not new guesswork but the unchanged, authoritative word the LORD had already spoken. By stressing that God Himself issued the message &#8220;earlier,&#8221; Isaiah underscores the reliability, patience, and eventual fulfillment of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Since that time.</span>--The phrase is used of an indefinite past, like our "of yore," or "of old time."
