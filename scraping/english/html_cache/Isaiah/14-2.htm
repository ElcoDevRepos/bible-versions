Historically, this can be seen in the context of the Babylonian exile and the subsequent return under leaders like Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. The involvement of "the nations" suggests a divine orchestration where even foreign powers are used to fulfill God's promises to Israel. This can be connected to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-22.htm">Isaiah 49:22</a>, where God promises to lift up His hand to the nations to bring His people back. It also foreshadows the ultimate gathering of God's people in eschatological times, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<p><b>Then the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD&#8217;s land.</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes, where Israel, once subjugated, will now have dominion over those who oppressed them. This reflects the covenantal promise of blessing and dominion found in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>. The concept of possessing nations can be seen as a type of the ultimate reign of Christ, where He will rule over all nations (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). The mention of "the LORD&#8217;s land" emphasizes the divine ownership and sanctity of the land of Israel, reinforcing the idea that this is not merely a political or military victory but a fulfillment of God's sovereign plan.<p><b>They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of divine justice and retribution. It echoes the principle found in the Abrahamic covenant that those who curse Israel will be cursed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The reversal of roles serves as a powerful reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises and His ability to bring about justice. This can also be seen as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, where He triumphs over the ultimate oppressors of humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>). The imagery of captives becoming rulers is a foretaste of the believer's future reign with Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a> and <a

God&#8217;s order exalts the once-oppressed and humbles the proud.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a> promises a literal, future reversal for Israel: Gentile nations will physically return God&#8217;s people to their land, willingly serve them, and experience the just retribution of roles reversed under Messiah&#8217;s kingdom. The passage showcases God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, His passion for justice, and His determination to glorify Himself through Israel while graciously including the nations who embrace Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The people shall take them . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the peoples. </span>In <a href="/context/ezra/1-1.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">Ezra 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/ezra/6-7.htm" title="Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.">Ezra 6:7-8</a>, we have what answered, in a measure, to the picture thus drawn; but here, as elsewhere, the words paint an ideal to which there has been as yet no historical reality fully corresponding. No period of later Jewish history has beheld the people ruling over a conquered race; and if we claim a real fulfilment of the last clause of the verse, it is only in the sense in which the Latin poet said that <span class= "ital">Gr?cia capta ferum victorem cepit </span>(Horat. <span class= "ital">Ep. </span>II. i. 156). The triumph of Israel has, so far, been found in that of its leading ideas, and in the victory of the faith of Christ. In <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3</a> the proselyte appears as admitted on terms of equality, here on those of subjugation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the people shall take them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">peoples shall take them</span>. The heathen nations among whom they have dwelt shall rejoice at the restoration of Israel to their own land, and even escort them in a friendly spirit to their borders (comp. <a href="/ezra/1-4.htm">Ezra 1:4, 6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7-9</a>). Some shall go so far as voluntarily to become their bondservants in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take them captive, whose captives they were</span>. This can scarcely have been intended literally. The Jews were at no time a conquering people, nor one that set itself to "take captives." The true meaning is that Jewish ideas shall penetrate and subdue the nations generally, and among them those with whom Israel had dwelt as captives. The Jews did become very powerful and numerous both in Assyria and Babylonia about the first century after Christ, and Christian Churches were early formed in Mesopotamia, Adiabene, and even Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will escort [Israel]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
