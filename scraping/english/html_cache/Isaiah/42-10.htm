In biblical context, a "new song" frequently signifies a response to God's redemptive acts (<a href="/psalms/96.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). It reflects the anticipation of the Messiah's coming and the establishment of His kingdom, which brings about a new covenant and a renewed relationship with God.<p><b>His praise from the ends of the earth&#8212;</b><br>This emphasizes the universal scope of God's glory and the call for all nations to recognize and worship Him. The phrase "ends of the earth" suggests the inclusion of Gentiles in the worship of Yahweh, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). It points to the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the maritime regions and those who travel or live by the sea. In ancient times, the sea was often seen as a place of chaos and mystery, yet here it is called to join in the praise of God, indicating His sovereignty over all creation. The mention of the sea and its contents can also symbolize the vastness and diversity of God's creation, all of which are called to worship Him (<a href="/psalms/148-7.htm">Psalm 148:7</a>).<p><b>you islands, and all who dwell in them.</b><br>The reference to islands signifies distant lands and peoples, further emphasizing the global reach of God's salvation and the call for all humanity to worship Him. In the ancient Near Eastern context, islands were often seen as remote and isolated, yet they too are included in the call to praise. This foreshadows the spread of the Gospel to the Gentiles and the inclusion of all peoples in God's redemptive plan (<a href="/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>, <a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure of worship in this verse, calling for a new song of praise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Represents the vastness of creation and the people who travel or live by it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_islands.htm">The Islands</a></b><br>Symbolic of distant lands and peoples, emphasizing the global call to worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the universal scope of God's call to praise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered this message, speaking to the people of Israel and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_worship.htm">The Call to Worship</a></b><br>God invites all creation to join in a new song of praise, emphasizing the importance of worship in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_scope_of_god's_kingdom.htm">Global Scope of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>The mention of the sea and islands highlights the universal reach of God's message, encouraging us to think beyond our immediate surroundings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/renewal_in_worship.htm">Renewal in Worship</a></b><br>A "new song" suggests freshness and renewal in our worship practices, challenging us to avoid stagnation in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_praise.htm">Inclusivity in Praise</a></b><br>The call to the "ends of the earth" reminds us that God's invitation to worship is for all people, regardless of background or location.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>Isaiah's prophecy points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, encouraging us to see the continuity of God's plan through Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_42_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 42:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_sing_a_new_song_to_the_LORD_today_2.htm">How can we "sing to the LORD a new song" in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_42_10_on_God_s_global_rule.htm">What does Isaiah 42:10 teach about God's sovereignty over "the ends of the earth"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_42_10_to_Matthew_28_19-20.htm">How does Isaiah 42:10 connect with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_involve_the_sea_in_worship.htm">In what ways can we involve "the sea and its fullness" in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_42_10_s_impact_on_missions.htm">How can Isaiah 42:10 inspire global missions and outreach efforts in our church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_42_10_God_s_rule_over_all.htm">How does Isaiah 42:10 reflect God's sovereignty over creation and nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_sing_a_new_song_in_Isaiah_42_10.htm">What is the significance of singing a new song in Isaiah 42:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_42_10_and_God_s_salvation_link.htm">How does Isaiah 42:10 relate to the theme of God's salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_42.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 42?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_isaiah_42_10-12's_global_praise.htm">Where is the scientific or archeological evidence supporting Isaiah 42:10&#8211;12&#8217;s claim of global praise to this servant?

Whenever God brings a fresh act of deliverance, His people respond with a fresh song (<a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>). The picture anticipates the ultimate redemption in Christ, echoed in <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a> where heaven bursts into &#8220;a new song&#8221; celebrating the Lamb&#8217;s victory. Just as the Exodus prompted Moses&#8217; song (<a href="/bsb/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>), the coming salvation calls every believer to wholehearted, creative praise today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His praise from the ends of the earth</b><p>Worship is not limited to Jerusalem; it must flow from every corner of the globe. <a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27</a> foretells, &#8220;All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD.&#8221; Jesus echoed this scope in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, charging His followers to bear witness &#8220;to the ends of the earth.&#8221; Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy therefore looks beyond Judah&#8217;s return from exile to the worldwide spread of the gospel and the global chorus that will result.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you who go down to the sea</b><p>Mariners, fishermen, and seafaring merchants are summoned. In <a href="/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23-24</a> those &#8220;who go down to the sea in ships&#8221; witness God&#8217;s wonders; here they are called to praise Him openly. The invitation assures anyone whose life is tied to the vast, unpredictable ocean that the Lord of Israel is also Lord of the seas.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all that is in it</b><p>Praise rises not only from people but from every creature and natural force. Isaiah joins <a href="/psalms/148-7.htm">Psalm 148:7-10</a> in personifying creation&#8212;sea monsters, depths, and weather elements&#8212;beckoning them to glorify their Maker. <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a> reminds us that all creation &#8220;groans&#8221; for renewal; Isaiah anticipates that day when creation&#8217;s voice will harmonize with redeemed humanity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you islands</b><p>Islands represent the most remote, hard-to-reach places. Earlier Isaiah said, &#8220;The islands will wait for His instruction&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>). God&#8217;s heart embraces distant shores like Malta (<a href="/bsb/acts/28.htm">Acts 28</a>) and Patmos (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>) as readily as Zion. The Servant&#8217;s mission guarantees that no culture or coast is overlooked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all who dwell in them</b><p>Every inhabitant, from bustling port cities to isolated villages, is included. <a href="/psalms/98-4.htm">Psalm 98:4</a> shouts, &#8220;Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth,&#8221; and <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a> pictures &#8220;a great multitude&#8230;from every nation, tribe, people, and language.&#8221; Isaiah&#8217;s call erases ethnic, geographic, and cultural barriers, inviting every soul into the same saving song.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/42-10.htm">Isaiah 42:10</a> is a sweeping summons to universal worship triggered by God&#8217;s new, decisive act of salvation through His Servant. The verse moves from a personal command (&#8220;Sing&#8221;) to a global chorus that enlists seas, islands, and all peoples. It anticipates the gospel&#8217;s spread, assures that creation itself will join the celebration, and urges believers today to lift fresh, wholehearted praise that matches the greatness of the redemption we have received.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Sing unto the Lord a new song.</span>--The words are familiar in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/33-3.htm" title="Sing to him a new song; play skillfully with a loud noise.">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-3.htm" title="And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.">Psalm 40:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-1.htm" title="O sing to the LORD a new song; for he has done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, has gotten him the victory.">Psalm 98:1</a>) and are probably quoted from them. The only touch of definite localisation is found in the mention of Kedar. (See Note on <a href="/isaiah/21-16.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:">Isaiah 21:16</a>.) Starting from this, the other terms gain a more defined significance. The proclamation seems to be addressed to the nations of the Eastern, not the Western world, as if to the ships that sailed from Elath or Ezion-geber down the Elanitic Gulf. The rock, or Sela (see <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>), is the Petra of Roman Idumaea; the ships are those that trade to Ophir or the land of Sinim. The cities and the nomad tribes are all invited to join in the hymn of praise, and it is to be echoed in the far-off "islands," or <span class= "ital">coasts, </span>of the Indian Ocean.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing unto the Lord a new song</span>. The call for a "new song" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a "new" one (see ver. 9). The expression is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/33-3.htm">Psalm 33:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/96-1.htm">Psalm 96:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-9.htm">Psalm 144:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His praise from the end of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let his praise be sung by all the inhabitants of the earth to its remotest bounds." <span class="cmt_word">The sea</span>. Sea and land are called upon equally to proclaim God's praise; the sea, "and its fulness" (margin) - those who frequent it in ships, and those who dwell on its shores and islands.
