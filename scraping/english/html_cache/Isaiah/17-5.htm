In ancient Israel, reaping was a significant agricultural activity, symbolizing both provision and the end of a growth period. The reaper's action signifies a decisive moment, often used in scripture to describe God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>). The standing grain represents those who are ripe for judgment, indicating a time when God will separate the righteous from the wicked.<p><b>and harvests the ears with his arm</b><br>The act of harvesting with one's arm suggests a personal and direct involvement in the process. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's active role in judgment and salvation. The imagery of the arm is often associated with strength and power in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, <a href="/psalms/89-13.htm">Psalm 89:13</a>). It underscores the idea that God is both the judge and the redeemer, actively working in the world to bring about His purposes.<p><b>as one gleans heads of grain</b><br>Gleaning was a practice in ancient Israel where the poor and needy could collect leftover crops after the main harvest (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, <a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2-3</a>). This phrase suggests a thorough and complete gathering, leaving nothing behind. It implies that God's judgment will be comprehensive, ensuring that all are accounted for. The act of gleaning also reflects God's provision and care for His people, even in times of judgment.<p><b>in the Valley of Rephaim</b><br>The Valley of Rephaim was a fertile area near Jerusalem, known for its agricultural productivity (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>, <a href="/1_chronicles/14-9.htm">1 Chronicles 14:9</a>). Historically, it was a site of battles and divine intervention, where David defeated the Philistines with God's help. The mention of this valley connects the prophecy to a real geographical location, emphasizing the certainty and historical grounding of God's actions. It serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and His ongoing sovereignty over the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reaper.htm">Reaper</a></b><br>A person who gathers crops at harvest time.

In plain terms, the northern kingdom and its ally Damascus will be stripped of strength.<p>&#8226; A reaper does not hesitate. Once he enters the field every upright stalk is marked for cutting. In the same way, God&#8217;s judgment will move swiftly and decisively&#8212;nothing that still &#8220;stands&#8221; in pride will be spared (cf. <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; 16:9).<p>&#8226; The picture also carries purpose. The harvest is not random destruction; it is the planned removal of a crop that has reached its appointed time (<a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>).<p>&#8226; For the faithful remnant, this image reassures that events are under divine control. What may look like chaos is actually the ordered work of the Lord of the harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and harvests the ears with his arm</b><p>&#8226; The reaper presses the cut grain against his chest with one arm while swinging the sickle with the other. It is close-up, hands-on work&#8212;nothing escapes his reach.<p>&#8226; Likewise the Assyrian conquest would be personal and unavoidable. Every &#8220;ear&#8221; (the visible fruit of the nation) would be grasped and removed (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The focus on the arm suggests strength and certainty (<a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>). God is never at the mercy of political forces; He directs them.<p>&#8226; Although the motion is severe, it also hints at future gathering. The same arm that sweeps in judgment will one day gather in mercy (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11&#8211;12</a>; 27:12).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;as one gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim</b><p>&#8226; After the main harvesters pass, gleaners return to pick up the few heads left behind (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9&#8211;10</a>). The prophecy points to a remnant&#8212;small, yet spared (<a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>; 24:13; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Valley of Rephaim, just southwest of Jerusalem, was famed for rich fields (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>). Even there, normally abundant grain could be reduced to scattered leftovers. Judgment reaches the most fertile places.<p>&#8226; For those who remain, gleaning is a gift. God ensures that His covenant people are never wiped out (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; The image urges humility. Will we be among the &#8220;gleanings&#8221; who depend entirely on God&#8217;s grace rather than on national strength or personal success?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a> uses the harvest cycle to illustrate coming judgment on Damascus and Ephraim. Like a reaper, God will cut down every proud, standing stalk; with strong arm He will sweep away the fruit; yet He will still leave a few gleanings, preserving a remnant by sheer mercy. The verse calls us to recognize His sovereign control, accept His discipline, and cling to the hope that He never forsakes those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn.</span>--The work of devastation is described under another image.

It was famous for its fertility, and was often on that account attacked by the Philistines, who came to carry off its crops (<a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm" title="And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.">2Samuel 23:13</a>).
