It suggests a recognition of human limitations in understanding God's actions. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38</a>, King Hezekiah has just experienced a miraculous healing and extension of life. This rhetorical question underscores the awe and reverence one should have before God's sovereign will, similar to Job's response to God's overwhelming presence (<a href="/job/42.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>).<p><b>He has spoken to me,</b><br>This acknowledges direct communication from God, emphasizing the personal relationship between God and His chosen leaders. In the historical context, God communicated with Hezekiah through the prophet Isaiah, who delivered messages of both warning and hope. This phrase highlights the importance of prophecy in the Old Testament, where God often revealed His plans and purposes through His prophets (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><b>and He Himself has done this.</b><br>This statement attributes the actions directly to God, affirming His active role in the events of Hezekiah's life. It reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to intervene in human affairs. The healing of Hezekiah and the sign of the sun's shadow moving backward (<a href="/isaiah/38-7.htm">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>) serve as a testament to God's power and faithfulness, reminiscent of other divine interventions such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>).<p><b>I will walk slowly all my years</b><br>This phrase suggests a commitment to live a life marked by reflection and gratitude. The idea of walking slowly can be seen as a metaphor for living with intentionality and awareness of God's presence. It echoes the biblical theme of walking with God, as seen in the lives of Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), who are described as walking faithfully with God.<p><b>because of the anguish of my soul.</b><br>Hezekiah's experience of illness and recovery brought about deep emotional and spiritual reflection. The anguish mentioned here can be understood as a catalyst for spiritual growth and dependence on God. This mirrors the biblical principle that suffering can lead to a deeper understanding of God's grace and purpose, as seen in the life of the Apostle Paul, who found strength in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who fell ill and was told by the prophet Isaiah that he would die.

He is "at a loss to express his wonder and his gratitude" (Cheyne); comp. <a href="/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a>.

Delitzsch renders, "I shall walk quietly;" Mr. Cheyne, "I shall walk at ease;" both apparently understanding the expression of a quiet, easy life, made the more pleasant by contrast with past pain.
