The temple of Nisroch, an Assyrian deity, highlights the polytheistic practices of the Assyrians, contrasting with the monotheism of Israel. Worship in such temples was a common practice for kings seeking favor from their gods. Archaeological evidence of Assyrian temples provides insight into their religious practices, though Nisroch is not well-documented outside biblical texts.<p><b>his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to the sword</b><br>The assassination of Sennacherib by his sons is a fulfillment of the prophecy given earlier in <a href="/isaiah/37-7.htm">Isaiah 37:7</a>. This act of patricide reflects the turbulent and often violent nature of royal succession in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The names Adrammelech and Sharezer are of Assyrian origin, and their actions may have been motivated by political ambition or internal family conflict.<p><b>and escaped to the land of Ararat</b><br>Ararat is a region associated with the mountains where Noah's Ark came to rest (<a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>). It is located in modern-day Turkey and Armenia. The escape to Ararat suggests a strategic retreat to a place outside the immediate reach of Assyrian power, indicating the sons' awareness of the political ramifications of their actions.<p><b>And his son Esar-haddon reigned in his place</b><br>Esar-haddon, another son of Sennacherib, ascended to the throne following his father's assassination. His reign is historically documented and marked by efforts to rebuild Babylon and maintain Assyrian dominance. This transition of power aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in the rise and fall of rulers. Esar-haddon's reign is also noted for its relative stability and successful military campaigns, which are recorded in Assyrian annals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who invaded Judah and besieged Jerusalem.

The etymology of the name, as meaning the "eagle" deity, is also one of the open questions of Assyrian research.<p><span class= "bld">Adrammelech and Sharezer</span>.--The former name appears in that of a deity of Sepharvaim in <a href="/2_kings/17-31.htm" title="And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.">2Kings 17:31</a>--its probable meaning being "the king of glory," that of Sharezer, "the ruler preserves," or, in a variant form, Sanatzu, "Sin (the moon-god) preserves." The Assyrian records, so far as they are yet interpreted, make no mention of the murder, but an insc<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm" title="And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.">Ezra 4:10</a>), from whom the later Samaritans were descended--as having taken Zidon and deported its inhabitants (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, iv.</span>, p. 111)--as having left in scriptions at <span class= "ital">Nahr-el-kelb, </span>near Beyrout, in which he describes himself as "King of Egypt, Thebes, and Ethiopia," as having probably been the "king of Assyria" who carried Manasseh bound in fetters to Babylon. The will of Sennacherib (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 136), giving him his chief treasures, and renaming him with a new title of sovereignty (Assur-Ebil-Muni-pal, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"Assur is lord, the establisher of the son "), seems to imply that he was a younger son, whom the fondness of Sennacherib had exalted above his elder brothers, who accordingly revenged themselves by the murder of their father.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nisroch his god</span>. The name Nisroch has not been found in the Assyrian inscriptions, and is, in fact, read only in this place and the parallel passage of Kings (<a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>). It has been supposed to represent Nusku, an Assyrian god of a somewhat low position, who, however, does not obtain mention in the historical inscriptions until the time of Asshur-bani-pal. Probably the name has suffered corruption. Asshur was, in fact, Sennacherib's favourite deity, and it is remarkable that the LXX. give in this place, not Nisroch, but <span class="accented">Asarach.</span> "Asarach" would seem to be "Asshur" with a guttural suffix. <span class="cmt_word">Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him.</span> The murder of Sennacherib by a son, whom he called "Ardumazanes," was related by Polyhistor (ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:5, &sect; l). Esar-haddon's annals are imperfect at the commencement, but show that his authority was at first contested, and that he had to establish it by force of arms ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 103, 104). Adrammelech seems to have assumed the title of king (Abyden. up. Euscb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:9, &sect; 1), and to have been put to death by his brother. Sharezer is not elsewhere mentioned. The name is Assyrian, as far as it goes, but is incomplete. Its full form was probably Nabu-sar-uzur or Nergal-sar-uzur (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 63, <span class="date">B.C. 682</span> and 678). And escaped into the land of Armenia. So Moses of Chorene ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">Ararat</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Urardu</span> or <span class="accented">Urartu</span>), which was the more eastern portion of Armenia, and lay beyond the sphere of Assyrian influence. Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. Esarhaddon (Asshur-akh iddiua) appears to have ascended the throne in <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. It is highly improbable that Isaiah was then living, and therefore the verse can scarcely be from his pen. It has probably been transferred from 2 Kings (2 Kings 19:37) in order to finish off the narrative. Esarhaddon outlived Hezekiah many years, and was brought into contact with Manasseh ('Eponym Canon,' p. 139), whom he reckoned among his tributaries (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
