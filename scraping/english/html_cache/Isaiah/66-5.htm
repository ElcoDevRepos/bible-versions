In the biblical context, trembling at God's word signifies a heart that is sensitive to His commands and teachings, akin to <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>, which speaks of God esteeming those who are humble and contrite in spirit. This reverence is a mark of true faith and obedience, contrasting with those who are merely outwardly religious. The concept of trembling at God's word is echoed in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, indicating a serious and earnest approach to living out one's faith.<p><b>hear the word of the LORD:</b><br>This call to hear emphasizes the importance of listening to God's message. In the Hebrew tradition, hearing is closely linked to obedience, as seen in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which calls Israel to hear and love the LORD with all their heart. The prophetic tradition often begins with a call to hear, underscoring the authority and urgency of the message. This phrase invites the faithful to pay attention to God's pronouncements, which often include both promises and warnings.<p><b>Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of My name</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the persecution faced by the faithful remnant from their own community. Historically, the Jewish people have experienced internal divisions, especially between those who remained faithful to God's covenant and those who did not. Jesus speaks of similar divisions in <a href="/matthew/10-21.htm">Matthew 10:21-22</a>, where He warns that following Him may lead to familial and social rejection. This persecution is not just a social or personal issue but is directly tied to the name of the LORD, indicating that the faithful are suffering for their allegiance to God.<p><b>have said, &#8216;Let the LORD be glorified that we may see your joy!&#8217;</b><br>This statement is likely sarcastic, as those who persecute the faithful mock their devotion. The persecutors challenge the faithful to prove God's presence and blessing in their lives, reminiscent of the taunts faced by Jesus on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-42.htm">Matthew 27:42-43</a>). The irony is that the persecutors claim to seek God's glory, yet their actions reveal a lack of true understanding and reverence for Him. This reflects a broader biblical theme where the wicked misunderstand or misrepresent God's purposes.<p><b>But they will be put to shame.</b><br>This phrase promises divine vindication for the faithful. Throughout scripture, God assures His people that those who oppose Him and His followers will ultimately face shame and judgment. This is seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>, where those who wait on the LORD are promised that they will not be put to shame. The ultimate fulfillment of this promise is found in the eschatological hope of God's final judgment, where the righteous are vindicated, and the wicked are judged, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>. This assurance encourages believers to remain steadfast in their faith despite persecution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God who speaks to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_tremble_at_his_word.htm">Those who tremble at His word</a></b><br>Faithful believers who revere and respect God's word.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_brothers.htm">Your brothers</a></b><br>Fellow Israelites who oppose and persecute the faithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_remnant.htm">The faithful remnant</a></b><br>A group within Israel who remain true to God's commands.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_vindication.htm">The event of vindication</a></b><br>The future moment when God will vindicate His faithful followers and shame their oppressors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_word.htm">Reverence for God's Word</a></b><br>Believers are called to tremble at God's word, showing deep respect and obedience.

Scoffers cloak contempt in religious language, but God promises to expose their deception and vindicate His faithful ones. In every age, the pattern holds: humble listeners are honored, mockers are humbled, and the Lord&#8217;s glory is revealed in the joy of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Hear the word of the Lord . . .</span>--The prophet turns from the hypocrites to the persecuted remnant. The self-righteous, self-exalting Pharisee (comp. <a href="/isaiah/65-5.htm" title="Which say, Stand by yourself, come not near to me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.">Isaiah 65:5</a>) repudiates, and, as it were, excommunicates, the true worshippers, and taunts them with their devotion to a God who does not help them. In words which find an echo in <a href="/matthew/27-42.htm" title="He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.">Matthew 27:42</a>, they said, "Let Jehovah glorify Himself, that we may look on your joy." The prophet adds the doom that shall fall upon the mockers: "They, and not those whom they deride, shall be put to shame."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-14.</span> - THE GODLY EXILES ENCOURAGED. The scoffs which have long greeted those who believed God's promises and expected the restoration of Zion, will be put to shame. The silence in which Zion has lain will be broken; she will be once more a city "full of stirs, a tumultuous city" (<a href="/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a>). Suddenly, without any pains of travail, she will bring forth; and her offspring will be "a nation born at once" (ver. 8). The godly exiles are called upon to rejoice at the prospect (ver. 10), and promised peace and comfort in the restored city (vers. 11-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear... ye that tremble</span>.
