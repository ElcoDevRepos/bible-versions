The withering of its fields symbolizes judgment and desolation, reflecting God's displeasure with Moab. This imagery of withering is consistent with other biblical passages where agricultural failure signifies divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10-12</a>).<p><b>along with the grapevines of Sibmah</b><br>Sibmah was renowned for its vineyards, producing wine that was highly valued. The destruction of these grapevines indicates a loss of economic wealth and cultural pride. In biblical symbolism, vineyards often represent the people of God (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), and their destruction can signify spiritual decline or judgment.<p><b>The rulers of the nations have trampled its choicest vines</b><br>This phrase suggests foreign invasion and conquest, a common theme in the prophetic literature where God uses other nations as instruments of judgment (e.g., Assyria and Babylon). The trampling of the choicest vines indicates the severity of the devastation, as the best and most valued parts of Moab's agriculture are destroyed.<p><b>which had reached as far as Jazer and spread toward the desert</b><br>Jazer was a city located north of Heshbon, indicating the extensive reach of Moab's vineyards. The spreading toward the desert suggests the vastness and prosperity of Moab before judgment. This geographical reference highlights the comprehensive nature of the impending desolation.<p><b>Their shoots had spread out and passed over the sea</b><br>The imagery of shoots spreading over the sea suggests the far-reaching influence and prosperity of Moab's agriculture. The sea could refer to the Dead Sea, emphasizing the extent of Moab's former glory. This phrase also evokes the idea of unchecked growth and expansion, which is now curtailed by divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Moab, known for its fertile fields and vineyards.

In the word for "lords" (<span class= "ital">baalim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>we have a parallel to the "lords of the high places of Arnon," in <a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fields of Heshbon</span> (see the comment on Isaiah 15:4). The whole of the Mishor, or Belka, on the edge of which <span class="accented">Hesbdn</span> stands, is cultivable and capable of producing good crops. The Moabites stored water in reservoirs (<a href="/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>), and made their country a garden. <span class="cmt_word">The vine of Sib-mah</span>. "Sibmah" is mentioned in <a href="/numbers/32-8.htm">Numbers 32:8</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-19.htm">Joshua 13:19</a> among the towns of the Reubenites. According to Jerome ('Comment. in Esaiam'), it was less than half a mile distant from Heshbon. Jeremiah follows Isaiah in lamenting the destruction of its vines (<a href="/jeremiah/48-32.htm">Jeremiah 48:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof</span>. "The lords of the heathen" are probably the Assyrians, who made a practice of destroying the fruit trees in an enemy's country, for the mere purpose of doing mischief ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 84). It is wanton to discard this very satisfactory sense for the strange one that "the choice plants have broken <span class="accented">down -</span> i.e., made drunk - the lords of the heathen" (Cheyne). The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by Gesenius, Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Meier, and Dr. Kay. <span class="cmt_word">They are come even unto Jazer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">the vines</span>)<span class="accented">reached to Jazer</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vine of Sibmah was cultivated as far as Jazer. Jazer lay about twelve miles north of Heshben, in the territory of Gad (<a href="/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>). It is probably identified with <span class="accented">Es Szir</span>, which is in the required position, and retains a trace of the name (Seetzen,' Reisen,' vol. 1. pp. 397, 398). <span class="cmt_word">They wandered through the wilderness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they strayed into the wilderness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cultivation was pushed eastward into the actual <span class="accented">midbar</span>, or desert. <span class="cmt_word">Her branches are stretched out</span>; or, <span class="accented">her offshoots are spread abroad</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the young shoots or slips are taken by the cultivators and spread further and further. They are even carried across the Dead Sea, and planted on its western shore. Mr. Cheyne supposes the prophet to refer to the "vineyards of En-gedi" (<a href="/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fields</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;a&#7695;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7709.htm">Strong's 7709: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cultivated field</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Heshbon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#353;&#183;b&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2809.htm">Strong's 2809: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heshbon -- a place East of the Jordan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have withered,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1467;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1436;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;um&#183;l&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_535.htm">Strong's 535: </a> </span><span class="str2">To droop, to be sick, to mourn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with the grapevines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ge&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1612.htm">Strong's 1612: </a> </span><span class="str2">A vine, the grape</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Sibmah.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;i&#7687;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7643.htm">Strong's 7643: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sibmah -- a place in Moab</span><br /><br /><span class="word">The rulers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1167.htm">Strong's 1167: </a> </span><span class="str2">A master, a husband, owner</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the nations</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#333;&#183;w&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1471.htm">Strong's 1471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foreign nation, a Gentile, a troop of animals, a flight of locusts</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have trampled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1986.htm">Strong's 1986: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike down, to hammer, stamp, conquer, disband</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its choicest vines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;r&#363;q&#183;qe&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct &#124;
