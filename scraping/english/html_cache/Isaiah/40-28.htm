Have you not heard?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the importance of recalling the foundational truths about God. It serves as a reminder to the Israelites, who were in exile, of the teachings they have received. This phrase echoes the call to remember God's past acts and His revealed word, similar to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>, where the Israelites are urged to remember what God has done for them.<p><b>The LORD is the everlasting God,</b><br>This affirms God's eternal nature, contrasting with the temporal nature of human life and the idols worshiped by surrounding nations. The term "everlasting" underscores God's unchanging and infinite existence, as seen in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God being from everlasting to everlasting.<p><b>the Creator of the ends of the earth.</b><br>This highlights God's sovereignty and omnipotence, affirming that He is the Creator of all things, not just Israel. It reflects the Genesis account of creation, where God is depicted as the originator of the universe. This also serves as a reminder of God's power over all nations and territories, reinforcing His authority and control over the entire earth.<p><b>He will not grow tired or weary;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's inexhaustible strength and energy, contrasting with human frailty. Unlike humans, who experience fatigue, God is depicted as perpetually active and powerful. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, which states that God neither slumbers nor sleeps, ensuring His constant vigilance and care.<p><b>His understanding is beyond searching out.</b><br>This speaks to the infinite wisdom and knowledge of God, which surpasses human comprehension. It aligns with <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>, where Paul marvels at the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. This phrase reassures believers of God's perfect understanding and His ability to govern the universe with justice and righteousness, even when His ways are beyond human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

In this context, He is described as the everlasting God and Creator.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>This phrase signifies the entirety of creation, emphasizing God's sovereignty and omnipresence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Isaiah primarily prophesied. The people of Judah were often reminded of God's power and faithfulness amidst their struggles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God bringing the universe into existence.

Creation itself proclaims His reality (<a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19-20</a>) and history testifies to His works (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-14</a>). The question is meant to shake complacency: we are accountable for the truth we&#8217;ve been shown. Like the psalmist who declares, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>), Isaiah expects the reader to lean on what is already known, not grope in uncertainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have you not heard?</b><p>Truth has also been proclaimed audibly&#8212;through prophets, priests, and Scriptures read aloud in Israel&#8217;s gatherings (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a>). &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The issue, then, is not whether God has spoken but whether His people have been listening attentively and believing what they&#8217;ve heard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD is the everlasting God</b><p>Here Isaiah names the covenant God&#8212;YHWH&#8212;who is eternal. Before the mountains were born, &#8220;from everlasting to everlasting You are God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). He precedes time, outlasts time, and rules over time (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>). Because He is everlasting, His promises never expire (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>), and His covenant love remains steady even when human faithfulness falters (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Creator of the ends of the earth</b><p>Isaiah anchors hope in the One who spoke galaxies into being (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>).

When Jeremiah marveled, &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD&#8230; nothing is too difficult for You&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>), he echoed this same truth: the Maker of all can handle all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will not grow tired or weary</b><p>Unlike humans who reach the limits of endurance, God&#8217;s energy is inexhaustible. &#8220;Indeed, He who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>). Elijah mocked powerless idols that &#8220;must be asleep&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), but Israel&#8217;s God never dozes.

He sees the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>) and threads every detail into His sovereign plan. When life looks tangled, remembering His limitless insight breeds humility and peace: &#8220;Great is our Lord and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a> pulls discouraged hearts back to the bedrock truths they already know and have heard: the LORD is the eternal, all-powerful, all-wise Creator.
