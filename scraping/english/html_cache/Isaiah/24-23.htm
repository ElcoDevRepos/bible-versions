In ancient Near Eastern cultures, celestial bodies like the moon and sun were often associated with deities or seen as powerful entities. Here, their confounding and shame suggest their subordination to the LORD's majesty. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, where cosmic disturbances accompany divine intervention. The language underscores the idea that God's glory will eclipse all other sources of light and power.<p><b>for the LORD of Hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority over heavenly armies and earthly powers. Mount Zion, a hill in Jerusalem, holds significant theological importance as the symbolic dwelling place of God and the center of His kingdom. Historically, Jerusalem was the political and spiritual heart of Israel, and its mention here reinforces the idea of God's reign being both literal and spiritual. This prophecy anticipates a future time when God's rule will be fully realized in Jerusalem, aligning with messianic expectations found in passages like <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>.<p><b>and before His elders with great glory.</b><br>The presence of "His elders" suggests a council or assembly of leaders who witness and affirm God's reign. In biblical tradition, elders often represent wisdom and authority within the community, as seen in <a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>. The phrase "with great glory" highlights the splendor and majesty of God's rule, surpassing all earthly glory. This scene foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom, where His glory is fully revealed and acknowledged by all, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>.
