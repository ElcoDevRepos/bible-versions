The heavens often symbolize the spiritual realm and God's sovereignty over creation. The call to sing for joy reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and His mighty works, reminiscent of the creation's response in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, where the heavens declare the glory of God. This joy is rooted in the divine intervention and redemption that God has accomplished, echoing the joy found in the heavenly host's proclamation at the birth of Christ (<a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13-14</a>).<p><b>shout aloud, O depths of the earth.</b><br>The "depths of the earth" refers to the most remote and hidden parts of creation, emphasizing that all of creation is to participate in this celebration. This phrase suggests that God's redemptive acts are so profound that they reach even the deepest parts of the earth, symbolizing total and complete redemption. It parallels the imagery in <a href="/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11-12</a>, where the earth and sea are called to rejoice before the Lord. This universal call to praise underscores the comprehensive nature of God's salvation plan.<p><b>Break forth in song, O mountains, you forests and all your trees.</b><br>Mountains, forests, and trees are often used in Scripture to symbolize strength, stability, and life. Their call to "break forth in song" signifies a spontaneous and overwhelming response to God's redemptive work. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>, where the mountains and hills break forth into singing, and the trees clap their hands, symbolizing the joy and renewal that accompany God's salvation. It also points to the restoration of creation, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a>, where creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the children of God.<p><b>For the LORD has redeemed Jacob,</b><br>The redemption of Jacob refers to the deliverance and restoration of the nation of Israel, often personified as Jacob. This redemption is both physical, in terms of deliverance from exile, and spiritual, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ. The term "redeemed" is significant, as it implies a price paid for freedom, foreshadowing the sacrificial work of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). This act of redemption fulfills God's covenant promises to the patriarchs and highlights His faithfulness and mercy.<p><b>and revealed His glory in Israel.</b><br>God's glory is His manifest presence and power, often associated with His acts of salvation and judgment. The revelation of His glory in Israel signifies the visible demonstration of His divine attributes and the fulfillment of His promises. This revelation is a testament to God's faithfulness and serves as a witness to the nations. It anticipates the ultimate revelation of God's glory in the person of Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory. This phrase underscores the centrality of Israel in God's redemptive plan and the broader implications for all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the central figure in this passage, performing acts of redemption and revealing His glory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, whom God has redeemed. Jacob is often used as a synonym for Israel, highlighting the personal and national aspects of God's relationship with His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>The entire creation is called to rejoice, symbolizing the universal impact of God's redemptive work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains,_forest,_and_trees.htm">Mountains, Forest, and Trees</a></b><br>Elements of nature personified to express joy and celebration, emphasizing the grandeur and completeness of God's salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, through whom His glory is revealed, and who is the recipient of His redemptive acts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_redemption.htm">Joy in Redemption</a></b><br>The passage calls for a response of joy from all creation.

We should live in harmony with creation, acknowledging God's sovereignty over all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_glory_revealed.htm">God's Glory Revealed</a></b><br>The redemption of Israel is a demonstration of God's glory.

The sympathy of external nature with the fortunes of Israel is assumed throughout Isaiah, as it is throughout the Psalms (see <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>-8; 24:4-7; 29:17; 30:25, 26; 33:9; 35:1, 2, 7, etc.). If Israel is depressed, the earth must "mourn and languish," the heavens grow dark; the mountains shrink and "be ashamed." If, on the contrary, Israel prospers, heaven and earth, mountain and forest, <a href="/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>),of the joy felt by the angels over the returning and pardoned sinner; but the context of both passages is in favour of the material heavens being meant. It is quite possible that there is a real and not merely a fancied sympathy between the material and the spiritual worlds. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath done it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the Lord hath wrought - what</span> he has wrought is not said. Mr. Cheyne translates, "Jehovah hath done <span class="accented">nobly."</span> Shout, ye lower parts of the earth. Metonymy of the part for the whole - "the lower parts of the earth" for "the earth even to its lowest depths." There is no thought of <span class="accented">Sheol</span> or of its inhabitants. Break forth into singing (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>). As children and birds sing from the very gladness of their hearts, thereby venting the joy that almost oppresses them, so all nature is called upon, not merely to rejoice, but to give vent to its joy, now that Israel is redeemed and God glorified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/44-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sing for joy,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1504;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;n&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb -
