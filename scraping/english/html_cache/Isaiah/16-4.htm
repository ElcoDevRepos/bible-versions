In the context of Isaiah, the "fugitives" likely refer to the Moabites seeking refuge from impending judgment. Historically, Moab was a neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict but also sharing kinship through Lot, Abraham's nephew. The call for refuge reflects the biblical principle of providing sanctuary to those in distress, as seen in the cities of refuge established in Israel (<a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6-34</a>).<p><b>be a refuge for Moab from the destroyer.&#8221;</b><br>The "destroyer" likely refers to an invading force or divine judgment. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was vulnerable to attacks from larger empires like Assyria or Babylon. This plea for refuge underscores the transient nature of political alliances and the need for divine protection. Theologically, it echoes the concept of God as a refuge, a theme prevalent in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>When the oppressor has gone,</b><br>This anticipates a future time of relief and peace. The "oppressor" could be a specific enemy nation or a metaphor for any force of evil. Historically, Moab faced oppression from various empires. This phrase aligns with the prophetic hope for deliverance and restoration, a common theme in Isaiah and other prophetic books.<p><b>destruction has ceased,</b><br>This phrase indicates a cessation of violence and turmoil. It reflects the prophetic vision of a future where God's justice prevails, and peace is restored. The cessation of destruction is a recurring promise in the prophetic literature, pointing to the ultimate peace in the Messianic age (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>).<p><b>and the oppressors have vanished from the land,</b><br>The complete removal of oppressors signifies a total and lasting peace. This vision of liberation is consistent with the eschatological hope found throughout the Bible, where God promises to remove all sources of oppression and establish His kingdom of righteousness. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate liberator and prince of peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A people descended from Moab, the son of Lot.
