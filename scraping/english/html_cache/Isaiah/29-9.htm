In the context of Isaiah, the people of Judah are being warned about their spiritual complacency and impending judgment. The astonishment is a reaction to the realization of their spiritual blindness and the consequences of their actions. This echoes the call to repentance found throughout the prophetic books, where God often calls His people to stop and consider their ways (e.g., <a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5-7</a>).<p><b>blind yourselves and be sightless;</b><br>This is a metaphor for spiritual blindness, a condition where the people are unable to perceive God's truth and righteousness. It reflects a self-imposed ignorance, where the people choose not to see or understand God's will. This theme of spiritual blindness is prevalent in the Bible, notably in the New Testament, where Jesus often speaks of the Pharisees as blind guides (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). The blindness here is both a judgment and a consequence of their rebellion against God.<p><b>be drunk, but not with wine;</b><br>This phrase uses the imagery of drunkenness to describe a state of confusion and disorientation, not caused by alcohol but by spiritual and moral corruption. The people are intoxicated by their own pride, idolatry, and false security. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the effects of God's judgment, where people are unable to think or act clearly (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>). It highlights the depth of their spiritual decay and the seriousness of their condition.<p><b>stagger, but not from strong drink.</b><br>The staggering represents instability and a lack of direction, a result of their spiritual blindness and moral confusion. This condition is a direct consequence of turning away from God and relying on their own understanding. The imagery of staggering is used in other prophetic writings to depict the disorientation that comes from God's judgment (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17-23</a>). It serves as a warning of the inevitable downfall that comes from rejecting God's guidance and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

They have grown so accustomed to His warnings that only a jarring command can pierce their complacency.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, &#8220;stop&#8221; often introduces a summons to consider the Lord&#8217;s mighty works (<a href="/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-20.htm">Isaiah 41:20</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Be astonished&#8221; anticipates the shocking nature of what follows: judgment that will come because hearts have hardened (<a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a>). This is not mere surprise but a sacred awe mixed with dread.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>blind yourselves and be sightless</b><p>&#8220;Blind yourselves and be sightless&#8221;<p>&#8226; The blindness is first self&#8211;inflicted. Israel chooses not to see; therefore God confirms that choice (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual blindness is as real as physical blindness. Jesus cites this very dynamic when He explains why some refuse to believe (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>; <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later notes the same principle: &#8220;God gave them a spirit of stupor&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>). Persistent refusal to heed truth results in God&#8217;s judicial hardening.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>be drunk, but not with wine</b><p>&#8220;Be drunk, but not with wine&#8221;<p>&#8226; The image shifts to intoxication without alcohol. Confusion, disorientation, and reckless decisions will grip the nation.<p>&#8226; Isaiah uses the same metaphor when describing the cup of God&#8217;s wrath (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jeremiah echoes it: &#8220;They shall drink and stagger&#8230; because of the sword that I will send&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a>).<p>&#8226; On the Day of Pentecost some accused the disciples of drunkenness, yet Peter explained it was the Spirit at work (<a href="/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13-15</a>). Here, the opposite occurs&#8212;spiritual stupor produced by rejecting that Spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stagger, but not from strong drink</b><p>&#8220;Stagger, but not from strong drink&#8221;<p>&#8226; The result of God-induced stupor is staggering&#8212;moral, spiritual, and soon physical collapse (<a href="/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Like a person who cannot walk straight, the nation will lurch from one false hope to another (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Revelation pictures Babylon&#8217;s downfall in similar terms: nations &#8220;were made drunk with the wine of her fornication&#8221; and then fall (<a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>; 18:3).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a> portrays a people so determined to ignore God that He confirms their blindness and confusion. They are told to pause and face the astonishing reality: self-chosen spiritual blindness leads to God-given stupor. Judgment is certain unless they repent. The verse warns every generation that rejecting revealed truth results not in freedom but in deeper darkness and disorientation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Stay yourselves . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Astonish yourselves. </span>We can perhaps best understand the words by picturing to ourselves the prophet as preaching or reciting the previous prediction to his disciples and to the people. They are staggered, startled, incredulous, and he bursts into words of vehement reproof. The form of the verb implies that their astonished unbelief was self-caused. The change from the second person to the third implies that the prophet paused for a moment in his address to describe their state as an observer. Outwardly, they were as men too drunk to understand, but their drunkenness was not that of the "wine<span class= "ital">" </span>or the "strong drink" of the fermented palm-juice, in which, as in <a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm" title="But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.">Isaiah 28:7</a>, the prophet implies that they habitually indulged. Now their drunkenness was of another type.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - NEITHER WARNING NOR PROMISE COMPREHENDED BY THOSE TO WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, "Who hath believed our report?" says the prophet in another place (<a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), "and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" It was among the most painful circumstances attaching to the prophetical office, that scarcely ever was the prophet held in any esteem among his own people, or in his own lifetime. Isaiah knows that his warning will fall dead - that the people and their rulers have neither "eyes to see" nor "ears to hear." He places on record this knowledge, while at the same time striving if by any means he may arouse some from their condition of dull apathy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stay yourselves, and wonder</span>; rather, <span class="accented">stand stupefied and be astonished</span>. The prophet bids them act as he knows that they will act. They will simply "stare with astonishment" at a prophecy which will seem to them "out of all relation to facts" (Cheyne). They will not yield it the slightest credence. They will only marvel how a sane man could have uttered such egregious folly. <span class="cmt_word">Cry ye out, and cry</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "Blind yourselves, and be blind," which certainly gives a much better sense, and is justified by the use of the same verb in <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>. As Pharaoh began by hardening his own heart, and then God hardened it ('Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 103, 166, 203, etc.), so those who blind their own eyes, and will not see when they have the power, are, in the end, if they persist, judicially blinded by God. <span class="cmt_word">They are drunken, but not with wine.</span> "The drunkards of Ephraim" (<a href="/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>) were such literally. They "erred through strong drink" (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>); they "were swallowed up of wine;" but the case was different with the infatuated ones of Judah. They were morally, not physically, intoxicated. Their pride and self-trust rendered them as irrational and as unimpressionable as ever drunkenness rendered any man; but they were not actual drunkards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/29-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Stop</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7791;&#183;mah&#183;m&#601;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4102.htm">Strong's 4102: </a> </span><span class="str2">To question, hesitate, to be reluctant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and be astonished;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
