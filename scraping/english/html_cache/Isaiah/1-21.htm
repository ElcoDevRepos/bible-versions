The imagery of harlotry is used throughout the Bible to describe spiritual unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>). Jerusalem's idolatry and alliances with pagan nations are seen as acts of infidelity to God. Historically, this period saw Israel engaging in practices contrary to the covenant, such as idol worship and political alliances with Assyria and Egypt.<p><b>She once was full of justice;</b><br>Jerusalem was originally established as a city where justice and righteousness were upheld, reflecting God's character and law. King David and Solomon's reigns are often seen as high points of justice in Israel's history (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>, <a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>). The city was meant to be a beacon of God's justice to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>).<p><b>righteousness resided within her,</b><br>This phrase highlights the past presence of righteousness in Jerusalem, indicating a time when the leaders and people lived according to God's standards. The presence of righteousness is synonymous with God's blessing and favor. The prophets often called the people back to this standard (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>but now only murderers!</b><br>The stark contrast between the past and present state of Jerusalem is emphasized here. The city, once known for justice, is now characterized by violence and bloodshed. This reflects the moral and spiritual decay of the society, as seen in the actions of its leaders and people (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>). The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin in the biblical narrative, often leading to judgment (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, <a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_city.htm">The Faithful City (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>Once a symbol of faithfulness and justice, Jerusalem is now described as having turned away from its righteous path.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message, calling out the moral and spiritual decline of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and source of righteousness, lamenting the city's fall from grace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/murderers.htm">Murderers</a></b><br>Symbolic of the pervasive sin and corruption that have taken over the city.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_righteousness.htm">Justice and Righteousness</a></b><br>Once the defining characteristics of Jerusalem, now replaced by sin and injustice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_spiritual_decline.htm">The Danger of Spiritual Decline</a></b><br>Just as Jerusalem fell from faithfulness, we must guard against spiritual complacency and moral decay in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_justice_and_righteousness.htm">The Importance of Justice and Righteousness</a></b><br>God values justice and righteousness, and we are called to uphold these principles in our communities and personal lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite the harsh judgment, God's call to repentance offers hope for restoration.

Jerusalem&#8212;once loyal, just, and righteous&#8212;now mirrors a prostitute city filled with violence. The verse warns that abandoning the living God inevitably distorts worship, corrodes justice, and cheapens life. Yet by exposing the ruin, the LORD invites repentance and restoration, holding out hope that the city&#8212;and we&#8212;can be cleansed and made faithful again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">How is the faithful city become an harlot</span>! . . .--The opening word, as in <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm" title="How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!">Lamentations 1:1</a>, is the key-note of an elegiac wail, which opens a new section. The idea of prostitution as representing apostasy from Jehovah was involved in the thought that Israel was the bride whom He had wooed and won (Hosea 1-3; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). The imagery was made more impressive by the fact that actual prostitution entered so largely into the ritual of many of the forms of idolatry to which the Israelites were tempted (<a href="/context/numbers/25-1.htm" title="And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab.">Numbers 25:1-2</a>). So Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/16-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 16:1-14</a>) develops the symbolism with an almost terrible fulness. So our Lord spoke of the Pharisees as an "adulterous generation" (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>). The fact that Hosea, an earlier contemporary, had been led to tell how he had been taught the truth thus set forth by a living personal experience, is not without significance in its bearing on the <span class= "ital">genesis </span>of Isaiah's thoughts.<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">assassins. </span>The word implies not casual homicide, but something like the choice of murder and robbery as a profession. Hosea (<a href="/hosea/6-9.htm" title="And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.">Hosea 6:9</a>) had painted a like picture as true of Samaria. The traveller who sojourned in Jerusalem, the poor who lived there, were exposed to outrage and murder; and all this was passing before men's eyes at the very time when they were boasting, as it were, of their "glorious reformation." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - ISAIAH'S LAMENT OVER JERUSALEM.
