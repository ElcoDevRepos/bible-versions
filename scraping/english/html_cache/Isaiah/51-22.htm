The repetition of "Lord" and "God" underscores His supreme power and covenant relationship with Israel. The term "defends" highlights God's role as protector and advocate for His people, reflecting His commitment to their well-being. This echoes the covenant promises found in passages like <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God assures Israel of His protection and deliverance.<p><b>See, I have removed from your hand the cup of staggering.</b><br>The "cup of staggering" symbolizes divine judgment and wrath, often depicted as a cup that nations must drink, leading to their downfall (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>). The removal of this cup signifies the end of a period of punishment for Israel, suggesting a transition from judgment to restoration. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic theme of redemption and hope found throughout Isaiah.<p><b>From that goblet, the cup of My fury, you will never drink again.</b><br>The "cup of My fury" further illustrates God's wrath, which had been poured out on Israel due to their disobedience. The assurance that they "will never drink again" points to a future of peace and restoration, aligning with the eschatological hope of a new covenant where God's people are permanently reconciled to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). This promise foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ, who, in the New Testament, takes upon Himself the cup of wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), offering eternal salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both the Creator and Redeemer.
