In biblical times, these trees were highly valued for construction and religious purposes, including the building of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The statement underscores the insufficiency of even the most abundant natural resources to meet the requirements of a worthy offering to God. It emphasizes God's greatness and the inadequacy of human efforts to fully honor Him through material means alone. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God desires obedience and a contrite heart over mere ritual sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>).<p><b>nor its animals enough for a burnt offering</b><br>The reference to the animals of Lebanon not being enough for a burnt offering further illustrates the magnitude of God's majesty and the limitations of human offerings. Burnt offerings were a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God (Leviticus 1). However, this phrase suggests that even the most abundant and valuable sacrifices fall short of what God truly deserves. It points to the insufficiency of the Old Testament sacrificial system to fully atone for sin, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). This highlights the transition from the old covenant to the new, where Christ's sacrifice fulfills and surpasses all previous offerings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its majestic cedar trees, often symbolizing strength and grandeur in the Bible.

Lebanon is chosen as the type of the forests that supply the wood for burnt-offerings, in which Judah was comparatively poor. In Nehemiah's organisation of the Temple ritual the task of supplying wood for this purpose was assigned by lot to priests or Levites (<a href="/nehemiah/10-34.htm" title="And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:">Nehemiah 10:34</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lebanon is not sufficient to burn</span>. Man may think that he must be of some account, since God has required of him sacrifice and burnt offering, from which he may suppose God to derive some satisfaction. But, the prophet says, even if man were to burn all Lebanon as firewood on God's altar, and offer there all the (clean) beasts of the entire tract, still God would be put under no obligation.
