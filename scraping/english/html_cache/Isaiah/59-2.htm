In the biblical context, iniquities refer to moral wrongdoings or sins that are contrary to God's laws. The imagery of "barriers" suggests a wall or obstruction that prevents a close relationship with God. This idea is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where sin is often depicted as a hindrance to fellowship with God (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a>). Theologically, this separation underscores the need for atonement and reconciliation, which is a central theme throughout Scripture. The sacrificial system in the Old Testament, particularly the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), was instituted to temporarily bridge this gap, pointing forward to the ultimate reconciliation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>and your sins have hidden His face from you</b><br>The phrase "hidden His face" is a metaphor for God's withdrawal of favor and presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the face of a deity symbolized favor and blessing. When God "hides His face," it indicates a withdrawal of His presence and blessing due to the people's disobedience. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>, where God warns Israel of the consequences of forsaking Him. Theologically, this highlights the holiness of God and His intolerance of sin. It also emphasizes the need for repentance and turning back to God to restore the relationship, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>.<p><b>so that He does not hear</b><br>This phrase suggests that sin affects not only the relationship with God but also the efficacy of prayer. The idea that God does not hear is not about His inability to hear but rather His choice not to respond favorably to the prayers of those who are in unrepentant sin. This is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a> and <a href="/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>, which indicate that sin can hinder prayer. Theologically, this underscores the importance of righteousness and repentance in maintaining a communicative relationship with God. It also points to the intercessory role of Jesus Christ, who, as the sinless mediator, enables believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and salvation of Israel.
