In the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10</a>, God uses Assyria as an instrument of judgment against Israel, but the Assyrian king mistakenly attributes his success to his own power rather than recognizing God's sovereignty. This sets the stage for God's judgment against Assyria for its hubris.<p><b>&#8216;By the strength of my hand I have done this,</b><br>The Assyrian king attributes his military conquests to his own strength. Historically, Assyria was known for its powerful army and advanced military tactics, which allowed it to dominate the ancient Near East. This phrase highlights the king's failure to acknowledge that his victories were permitted by God. This mirrors the biblical theme found in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>, where God warns Israel not to credit their success to their own strength.<p><b>and by my wisdom, for I am clever.</b><br>Here, the king claims that his wisdom and intelligence are the reasons for his success. This reflects the cultural value placed on wisdom and strategy in ancient Near Eastern societies. However, the Bible consistently teaches that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The king's self-reliance and pride are reminiscent of the folly of human wisdom contrasted with divine wisdom, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>.<p><b>I have removed the boundaries of nations</b><br>This phrase refers to the Assyrian practice of redrawing territorial boundaries after conquest, often leading to the displacement of peoples. Historically, Assyria was known for its policy of deporting conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. This action is a direct challenge to God's established order, as God is the one who sets the boundaries of nations (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><b>and plundered their treasures;</b><br>The Assyrian empire was notorious for its wealth acquired through the plundering of conquered cities. This phrase underscores the materialistic and exploitative nature of Assyrian conquests. Biblically, the accumulation of wealth through unjust means is condemned (<a href="/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a>), and this serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of earthly riches (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>like a mighty one I subdued their rulers.</b><br>The king likens himself to a mighty warrior, emphasizing his dominance over other rulers. This reflects the historical reality of Assyria's dominance over the ancient Near East. However, the Bible often portrays God as the ultimate "Mighty One" (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), and this claim of might is a usurpation of God's rightful place. The subjugation of rulers also foreshadows the ultimate subjugation of all earthly powers to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this passage, known for its military might and conquests.

Assyria&#8217;s self-congratulation thus becomes a cautionary tale for every generation: &#8220;The Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart Him?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">For he saith, By the strength of my hand . . .</span>--Another reproduction of the style of the royal inscriptions of Assyria. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/37-10.htm" title="Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 37:10-13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I have removed the bounds of the people.</span>--The practice has, of course, more or less characterised the conquerors of all ages in their attempts to merge independent nationalities into one great empire; but it was pursued more systematically by Assyria than by most others. To be "a remover of boundaries and landmarks "was the title in which an Assyrian king most exulted. (Comp. inscription of Rimmon-nirari, in Smith's <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries, </span>pp. 243, 244. <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 3).<p><span class= "bld">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I have put down those that sat firmly. </span>The Hebrew word for "valiant man" means primarily a "bull," and then figuratively, as in Isa xxxiv, 7; <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>, a "mighty one." The fact that the bull appears so frequently in Assyrian monuments as a symbol of sovereignty, mates it probable that the word is used in that symbolic sense here. In <a href="/psalms/78-25.htm" title="Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.">Psalm 78:25</a>, the "mighty ones" to whom it is applied are those of the host of heaven, the angels of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he saith</span>. Neither this speech nor that in vers. 8-11, nor again that given in <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24, 25</a>, is to be regarded as historical in the sense of being the actual utterance of any Assyrian monarch. All are imaginary, speeches, composed by the prophet, whereby he expresses in his own language the thoughts which Assyrian kings entertained in their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">I have removed the bounds of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span>. Assyrian monarchs take as one of their titles "the remover of boundaries and landmarks" (G. Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' pp. 243, 244). <span class="cmt_word">And have robbed their treasures</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>). The plunder of conquered countries is constantly recorded by the Assyrian monarchs as one of the most important results of each successful expedition. It is not infrequently represented in the sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 85). <span class="cmt_word">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span> The passage is obscure; and many different renderings have been given. Perhaps the best is that of Mr. Cheyne, "I have brought down, like a mighty one, those that sat on thrones." <span class="accented">Abbir</span>, however, the word translated "a mighty one," as often means "a bull" (see <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>;
