In ancient Israel, the doorpost was significant, as it was where the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>) was to be inscribed, symbolizing devotion to God. By placing a memorial behind the door, the people were concealing their idolatry, indicating a betrayal of their covenant with God. This act reflects the syncretism prevalent in Israel, where pagan practices were mixed with the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed;</b><br>The imagery of uncovering a bed is often associated with infidelity and spiritual adultery in the Bible. Forsaking God implies a deliberate turning away from Him, akin to a spouse abandoning their partner. This metaphor highlights the seriousness of Israel's unfaithfulness, as they pursued other gods and alliances, abandoning their exclusive relationship with Yahweh. This theme of spiritual adultery is echoed in other prophetic books, such as Hosea, where Israel's unfaithfulness is likened to that of an unfaithful spouse.<p><b>you climbed up and opened it wide.</b><br>This phrase suggests an active pursuit of idolatry and immorality. Climbing up and opening the bed wide indicates a readiness and eagerness to engage in illicit relationships, both spiritually and possibly physically. The act of climbing up may also imply a deliberate effort to reach out to foreign powers or deities, seeking alliances and favor outside of God's provision. This reflects the historical context of Israel's political alliances with surrounding nations, often at the expense of their covenant with God.<p><b>And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved;</b><br>Making a pact signifies a formal agreement or covenant, often sealed with rituals or sacrifices. In this context, it indicates Israel's alliances with pagan nations and their gods, which were often solidified through intermarriage and shared religious practices. The phrase "whose bed you have loved" underscores the intimate and personal nature of these alliances, suggesting a deep-seated affection and commitment to these foreign entities over God. This reflects the historical reality of Israel's political and religious entanglements with nations like Assyria and Egypt.<p><b>you have gazed upon their nakedness.</b><br>Gazing upon nakedness is a metaphor for indulging in forbidden or shameful acts. In biblical terms, nakedness often symbolizes vulnerability and exposure, and to gaze upon it implies a willful participation in or acceptance of sin. This phrase suggests that Israel not only engaged in idolatry but also took pleasure in it, fully aware of its sinful nature. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of humanity's tendency to choose sin over obedience to God, as seen in the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, often depicted as unfaithful to God through idolatry and alliances with pagan nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one true God whom Israel has forsaken, as depicted in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatrous_practices.htm">Idolatrous Practices</a></b><br>The actions described in the verse, such as setting up memorials and uncovering beds, symbolize Israel's spiritual adultery and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_nations.htm">Pagan Nations</a></b><br>The entities with whom Israel made pacts, representing the foreign influences and false gods that led Israel astray.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The author of the book, who conveys God's message of judgment and hope to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adultery.htm">Spiritual Adultery</a></b><br>Just as Israel was unfaithful to God by turning to idols, Christians today must guard against allowing anything to take God's rightful place in their hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_in_modern_times.htm">Idolatry in Modern Times</a></b><br>Idolatry is not limited to physical idols;

Each phrase paints a progression&#8212;from secretly setting up idols, to openly preparing for spiritual adultery, to forging binding alliances, to indulging in the intimate details of sin. Taken literally, the verse indicts Judah&#8217;s idolatry and warns all believers: hidden compromises, deliberate sin, and entangling partnerships inevitably distance us from our covenant God. Faithfulness calls for single-hearted devotion, visible obedience at home and in public, and resolute rejection of any rival to the LORD&#8217;s rightful place in our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Hast thou set up thy remembrance . . .</span>--The noun has been commonly referred to the <span class= "ital">Mesusah, </span>or memorial text, "Jehovah is our God; Jehovah is one," which was to be written on the door-posts of each house (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm" title="And you shall write them on the posts of your house, and on your gates.">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-20.htm" title="And you shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates:">Deuteronomy 11:20</a>); and the prophet is supposed to point to the fact that this had been written <span class= "ital">behind </span>the door, as showing that Israel had been ashamed to confess her creed.

But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the "memorial" (<span class="accented">zikkaron</span>) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman. Many commentators think that it was of a phallic character (see <a href="/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>).

It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors.
