In biblical context, signs and witnesses often serve as reminders of God's covenant and faithfulness. The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, suggesting His supreme authority even in foreign lands like Egypt. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation often seen as an enemy of Israel, yet here, it becomes a place where God's presence is acknowledged. This transformation signifies a shift from judgment to redemption, aligning with prophecies of nations turning to God.<p><b>When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors,</b><br>This reflects a recurring biblical theme where people in distress call upon God for deliverance. The cry of the oppressed is a powerful motif, seen in the Israelites' bondage in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). It underscores God's responsiveness to human suffering and His role as a deliverer. The oppressors in this context could be internal or external forces causing distress, and the act of crying out signifies repentance and recognition of God's power to save.<p><b>He will send them a savior and defender to rescue them.</b><br>This promise of a savior and defender is a direct assurance of divine intervention. In the Old Testament, God often raised leaders like Moses, judges, and kings to deliver His people. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate Savior, Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's promise to rescue humanity from sin. The dual role of savior and defender highlights both the deliverance from immediate physical threats and the protection of spiritual well-being. This prophecy points to God's ongoing commitment to salvation and protection for those who turn to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly armies, highlighting His supreme authority and ability to deliver.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A nation historically known for its idolatry and opposition to Israel, yet here depicted as a recipient of God's mercy and deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppressors.htm">Oppressors</a></b><br>Those who bring suffering and hardship upon the people, prompting them to cry out to God for help.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/savior_and_defender.htm">Savior and Defender</a></b><br>A figure sent by God to rescue and protect the people, symbolizing divine intervention and salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cry_for_help.htm">Cry for Help</a></b><br>The act of the Egyptians calling out to God in their distress, signifying repentance and recognition of God's power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_mercy.htm">God's Sovereignty and Mercy</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all nations, including those historically opposed to His people.

<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By linking the sign directly to this name, Isaiah underlines that Egypt&#8217;s future hopes rest not in its own military prowess but in the all-sovereign Commander (<a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The witness therefore will not honor local deities like Ra or Osiris but the One who reigns over every host.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the land of Egypt.&#8221;

Like the future pilgrimage of Egypt to worship the King in <a href="/zechariah/14-18.htm">Zechariah 14:18</a>, this verse anticipates a transformed Egypt that acknowledges Israel&#8217;s God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they cry out</b><p>&#8220;When they cry out to the LORD&#8230;&#8221;

Crying out implies repentance and dependence, a turning from false confidences to the living God (<a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God listens; He &#8220;does not despise their supplication&#8221;

Earlier in the chapter the LORD had promised to hand Egypt over to &#8220;a cruel master&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-4.htm">Isaiah 19:4</a>). Oppression would be severe enough to break national pride.<p>&#8226; The cycle mirrors Israel&#8217;s experience under Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>) and later under foreign powers in <a href="/judges/3-8.htm">Judges 3:8-9</a>&#8212;bondage leading to cries for deliverance.<p>&#8226; God allows hardship, yet He never intends to abandon; discipline is meant to bring people back to Himself (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will send them a savior</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;He will send them a savior&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-20.htm">Isaiah 19:20</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Send&#8221; points to divine initiative.

The verse affirms God&#8217;s willingness to extend mercy beyond Israel, showing that any nation humbled by suffering and turning to Him will find deliverance&#8212;ultimately foreshadowed and fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the eternal Savior who rescues and guards all who call upon His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) F<span class= "bld">or they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors . . .</span>--The words are almost as an anticipation of the great truth proclaimed in <a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>. The prayers of the worshippers in spirit and in truth, whether Jews or proselytes, in Egypt should find as immediate an access to the ear of Jehovah as if they had been offered in the Temple at Jerusalem. If the people suffered under the oppression of a Pharaoh, or a Cambyses, or a Ptolemy, and prayed for deliverance, He would as certainly send them a saviour who should free them from the yoke as He had sent saviours to Israel of old in the persons of the judges (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Judges 3:15</a>; <a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>). It is open to us to see a yet higher fulfilment in the fact that the message of the Gospel brought peace and joy to those who were weary and heavy laden in Egypt, as well as in Galilee; to those who were looking for redemption in Alexandria not less than to those who were looking for it in Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be for a sign</span>.
