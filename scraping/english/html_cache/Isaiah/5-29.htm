In the ancient Near East, lions were symbols of strength and dominance. The roaring here signifies the impending judgment and the overwhelming power of the invading forces. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages where God uses nations as instruments of His judgment (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>). The lion's roar can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, symbolizing His ultimate authority and power.<p><b>they roar like young lions.</b><br>Young lions are known for their vigor and ferocity, emphasizing the aggressiveness and relentless nature of the invaders. This phrase highlights the youthful energy and determination of the attackers, suggesting that they are not only powerful but also eager and capable. The comparison to young lions can also imply a sense of pride and confidence in their strength, which is often seen in the youthful. This can be contrasted with the humility and meekness of Christ, who, though powerful, chose to lay down His life.<p><b>They growl and seize their prey;</b><br>The growling and seizing of prey depict the methodical and predatory nature of the invaders. This action suggests a calculated and inevitable capture, reflecting the certainty of God's judgment. The imagery of seizing prey is reminiscent of other biblical descriptions of judgment, such as in <a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>, where the lion's roar is linked to the certainty of its catch. This can also be seen as a warning to the people of Israel to repent and turn back to God to avoid such a fate.<p><b>they carry it away,</b><br>The act of carrying away the prey indicates the complete and total victory of the invaders. Historically, this reflects the Assyrian and Babylonian practices of deporting conquered peoples, which was a common tactic to prevent rebellion and assimilate them into the empire. This phrase underscores the totality of the judgment and the helplessness of those being judged. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the loss of His protection.<p><b>and no one can rescue it.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the hopelessness and inevitability of the situation. It underscores the idea that once God's judgment is decreed, no human power can intervene or reverse it. This is a sobering reminder of God's sovereignty and the futility of relying on human strength or alliances for deliverance. The inability to rescue is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>, where God warns of the consequences of forgetting Him. It also points to the ultimate rescue that only Christ can provide, as He is the only one who can save humanity from the judgment of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, representing the Southern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assyrian_army.htm">The Assyrian Army</a></b><br>Often seen as the immediate fulfillment of this prophecy, symbolizing God's instrument of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the ferocity and power of the invading forces.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The overarching theme of this passage, where God uses foreign nations to execute His judgment on His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of nations and uses them to fulfill His purposes, even in judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Reflect on how sin leads to judgment and the importance of repentance and obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Just as a lion's roar is powerful and commanding, so is the Word of God.

Isaiah uses that unmistakable roar to show how terrifying the coming invaders will be.<p>- The roar signals domination; when a lion bellows, every creature nearby knows who rules the territory. Likewise, God is warning Judah that a mighty army will soon announce its arrival with utter authority (<a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>).<p>- Because Scripture is historically accurate, this points to very real forces&#8212;Assyria first, then Babylon&#8212;sent as instruments of divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>; 10:5-6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They roar like young lions</b><p>&#8220; they roar like young lions &#8221;<p>- Young lions are vigorous, restless, and eager for the hunt. Isaiah highlights their energy: the invaders will strike with fresh strength, not an aging, spent force (<a href="/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11-12</a>).<p>- Youthful lions often hunt in groups, illustrating coordinated assaults. The image fits armies moving swiftly in ranks, each soldier bold and confident (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-8</a>).<p>- At the same time, God&#8217;s people are cautioned not to dismiss the warning. What looks unstoppable on earth is still under the sovereign hand of the Lord who raised these &#8220;young lions&#8221; for His purpose (<a href="/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They growl and seize their prey</b><p>&#8220; They growl and seize their prey &#8221;<p>- The growl is the low, threatening sound just before the kill. It marks the moment when danger becomes personal. Judah would feel the hot breath of the enemy at its gates (<a href="/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>).<p>- &#8220;Seize&#8221; shows sudden, decisive action. There will be no stalemate; the prey is captured. God&#8217;s warnings through earlier prophets had gone unheeded, so the seizure is a consequence of persistent rebellion (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-14</a>).<p>- Even in judgment, the Lord remains consistent with His character: He keeps covenant promises&#8212;including the covenant curses spelled out in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They carry it away, and no one can rescue it</b><p>&#8220; they carry it away, and no one can rescue it &#8221;<p>- Lions drag prey back to their lair; captives hauled off to foreign soil mirror that fate. History confirmed this when Israelites were exiled to Assyria and Judah later to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; 25:11).<p>- &#8220;No one can rescue&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty. When He acts in judgment, human power, politics, or alliances cannot overturn His decree (<a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm">Isaiah 43:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>).<p>- Yet the broader book of Isaiah also promises eventual redemption. The same God who allows the prey to be taken will later proclaim, &#8220;I will bring your descendants from the east and gather you from the west&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29</a> paints a four-part picture: a deafening lion&#8217;s roar warns of oncoming judgment; youthful strength guarantees the assault&#8217;s vigor; the growl and seizure confirm imminent capture; and the carried-off prey shows judgment&#8217;s completeness. The verse is a sober reminder that God&#8217;s warnings are literal and His authority total&#8212;yet His ultimate goal remains restoration for those who turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their roaring shall be like a lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">like a lioness</span>, which the Hebrews appear to have regarded as fiercer than a lion (see <a href="/genesis/44-9.htm">Genesis 44:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-11.htm">Habakkuk 2:11</a>).
