In the context of Isaiah, the prophet often contrasts the righteous with the wicked, emphasizing the blessings that come to those who follow God's ways. The concept of walking uprightly is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>, which describes the characteristics of those who may dwell in God's holy presence. The idea of walking suggests a continuous, habitual lifestyle of integrity and moral rectitude.<p><b>enter into peace;</b><br>The promise of peace is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with God's covenant blessings. In Isaiah, peace is not merely the absence of conflict but a state of wholeness and well-being that comes from a right relationship with God. This peace is a foretaste of the ultimate peace found in the Messianic kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. The Hebrew word for peace, "shalom," encompasses completeness, safety, and welfare, indicating a holistic sense of tranquility.<p><b>they find rest,</b><br>Rest in the biblical sense often signifies relief from labor and struggle, as well as spiritual repose. This rest is reminiscent of the Sabbath rest commanded in the Law, which serves as a symbol of the eternal rest promised to God's people. <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a> speaks of a Sabbath rest for the people of God, linking it to faith and obedience. The rest mentioned here can also be seen as a type of the eternal rest believers will experience in the presence of God.<p><b>lying down in death.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the reality of death but frames it in a context of hope and peace for the righteous. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, a peaceful death was considered a blessing, contrasting with the violent or untimely deaths of the wicked. The imagery of lying down suggests a gentle transition, akin to sleep, which is a common biblical metaphor for death (e.g., <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-13</a>). This peaceful death is a precursor to the resurrection hope found in the New Testament, where believers are promised eternal life through Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

Scripture consistently links &#8220;walking&#8221; with lifestyle choices: &#8220;He who walks with integrity walks securely&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>); &#8220;The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>). These verses underscore that uprightness is not perfection but steady faithfulness&#8212;choosing honesty when it costs, resisting compromise, loving neighbor because God commands it (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Such walking is possible only by trusting the Lord and relying on His Spirit, not on personal effort alone (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>enter into peace</b><p>God promises that those who live this way &#8220;enter into peace.&#8221; The phrase carries immediate and ultimate layers:<p>&#8226; In life&#8212;God &#8220;will keep in perfect peace the steadfast mind&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). Because their consciences are clear before Him, the upright enjoy inner calm that circumstances cannot erase (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; In death&#8212;&#8220;Since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>). This settled peace means no fear of judgment (<a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>). Jesus assures, &#8220;Peace I leave with you&#8230; Do not let your hearts be troubled&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they find rest</b><p>The word &#8220;rest&#8221; expands the promise. Rest in Scripture is a gift from God to His covenant people: &#8220;Come to Me&#8230; and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). It anticipates the believer&#8217;s ultimate Sabbath: &#8220;There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>). Death for the righteous is not dread but release: &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord&#8230; they will rest from their labors&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>). The weariness of battle against sin, injustice, and sorrow is exchanged for complete refreshment in God&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lying down in death</b><p>Isaiah finishes with a tender picture&#8212;like sheep folding legs beneath them at night. Death is described, not as annihilation, but as a gentle lying down under God&#8217;s care. Other passages echo the same comfort: &#8220;Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/116-15.htm">Psalm 116:15</a>). Paul reminds believers that to be &#8220;absent from the body&#8221; is to be &#8220;present with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>). We &#8220;do not grieve like the rest, who have no hope,&#8221; because &#8220;God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a>). Jesus Himself frames death as only temporary sleep before resurrection life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a> assures God&#8217;s faithful people that their upright walk ends, not in dread, but in threefold blessing: immediate peace with God, eternal rest from every struggle, and a gentle, hope-filled passage through death into His welcoming presence. Confidence in Christ transforms both life and death, urging us to persevere in integrity today while looking forward to perfect peace tomorrow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">He shall enter into peace . . .</span>--Notice- able as presenting the brighter side of the dim thoughts of Israel as to the life behind the veil, and so far contrasted with Hezekiah's shrinking fear.

Not merely into "stillness" or "silence" (<a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>), but into "peace," or, as the word might be rendered (Cheyne), "a state of peace." There is, no doubt, primarily, "<span class="accented">a</span> contrast to the awful troubles which the survivors will have to encounter" (Hengstenberg); but perhaps this contrast is not all that is meant. The "peace" is positive rather than negative, or it would scarcely be a consolation to any one. They shall rest in their beds; or, <span class="accented">upon their beds.</span> This expression seems to imply a consciousness of rest, and so a certain enjoyment of it. Each one walking in his uprightness; rather, <span class="accented">whosoever hath walked uprightly</span>, or <span class="accented">in a straight path</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/4-25.htm">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>). The phrase is an equivalent for "the righteous" of ver. 1, and refers to the life on earth of those who have gone down into silence, not to their life after they have reached the silent shore. Of that life the evangelical prophet is not commissioned to give us any information. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/57-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those who walk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">uprightly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1495;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5228.htm">Strong's 5228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straightforward, equitable, correct, integrity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">enter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into peace;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7965.htm">Strong's 7965: </a> </span><span class="str2">Safe, well, happy, friendly, welfare, health, prosperity, peace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they find rest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;n&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5117.htm">Strong's 5117: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rest, settle down</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lying down in death.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;k&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4904.htm">Strong's 4904: </a> </span><span class="str2">Place of lying, a couch, act of lying</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 57:2 He enters into peace (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 57:1"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 57:1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/57-3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 57:3"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 57:3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
