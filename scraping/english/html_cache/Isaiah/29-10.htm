This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>, where Paul speaks of a "spirit of stupor" given to Israel. The "deep sleep" suggests a lack of spiritual awareness or discernment, reminiscent of the deep sleep God caused to fall on Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>, but here it is a negative consequence of disobedience. Historically, this reflects a period when Israel was not receptive to God's messages, leading to their eventual downfall and exile. Theologically, it serves as a warning against spiritual complacency and the dangers of ignoring God's word.<p><b>He has shut your eyes, O prophets;</b><br>Prophets were meant to be the spiritual eyes of the nation, providing guidance and revelation from God. By shutting their eyes, God is indicating that the prophets are no longer receiving divine visions or insights. This is a form of judgment, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26-27</a>, where God makes Ezekiel mute as a sign to the people. The shutting of the prophets' eyes symbolizes a withdrawal of divine communication, leaving the people without guidance. This can be seen as a precursor to the silence between the Old and New Testaments, where prophetic voices were rare.<p><b>He has covered your heads, O seers.</b><br>Seers, like prophets, were individuals who received visions and insights from God. Covering their heads implies a cessation of their ability to perceive divine truths. This imagery is similar to the veil over Moses' face in <a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33</a>, but here it signifies a lack of revelation rather than protection from glory. The covering of the seers' heads indicates a period of spiritual darkness and confusion, where the people are left without clear direction. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus is the ultimate revelation, removing the veil and providing clarity and truth (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is actively involved in the lives of His people and the unfolding of history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people.

The passage warns that spiritual privileges carry responsibility; if truth is spurned, God can withdraw clarity. Yet His discipline always carries an invitation: when sleep is shattered by repentance, sight and vision return, and the God who once covered eyes graciously restores them to see again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The Lord hath poured out upon you . . .</span>--The prophet sees in the stupor and panic of the chief of the people what we call a judicial blindness, the retribution of those who had wilfully closed their eyes against the light.

But here it is "spiritual deadness and impassiveness" - an inability to appreciate, or even to understand, spiritual warnings. The Jews of Isaiah's time were sunk in a spiritual lethargy, from which he vainly endeavored to arouse them. This spiritual lethargy is here said to have been "poured out upon them by Jehovah;" but we are not to suppose that there was anything exceptional in their treatment - "because they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind" (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>), as he does men generally. <span class="cmt_word">Hath closed your eyes</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; and see also <a href="/matthew/12-13.htm">Matthew 12:13</a>; <a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>; <a href="/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>; <a href="/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>; <a href="/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>, etc.). The prophets. As the text stands, the proper translation would be, "For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes (the prophets), and your heads (the seers) hath he covered." But it is reasonably conjectured that the expressions, "the prophets," "the seers," are glosses, which have crept from the margin into the text (Eichhorn, Koppe, Cheyne). If so, they are probably mistaken glosses, the allusion being, not to particular classes, but to the actual "heads" and "eyes" of individual Hebrews, which were "closed" and "covered" by the judicial action of the Almighty. In the East a covering is often drawn over the head during sleep. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/29-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has poured out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;sa&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5258.htm">Strong's 5258: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pour out, a libation, to cast, to anoint a, king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
