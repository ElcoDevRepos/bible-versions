Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, but at this time, it was in decline and unable to offer the military support that Judah sought. The phrase highlights the futility of relying on human strength and political alliances instead of trusting in God. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where reliance on worldly powers is contrasted with faith in God (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The emptiness of Egypt's help underscores the spiritual lesson that true security comes from God alone.<p><b>therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still.</b><br>"Rahab" is a poetic name for Egypt, used elsewhere in the Bible (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>) to denote pride and arrogance. The term "Rahab" can also mean "storm" or "chaos," suggesting Egypt's turbulent nature. "Who Sits Still" implies inactivity or impotence, emphasizing Egypt's inability to act or provide real assistance. This imagery serves as a prophetic warning against misplaced trust in nations that appear strong but are ultimately powerless. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, where true deliverance and strength are found not in human alliances but in the Messiah, who offers salvation and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful nation in the ancient world, often seen as a symbol of worldly strength and reliance.

Rahab, "pride" or 'arrogance," would seem to have been an old name for Egypt (<a href="/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), not one given at this time by Isaiah.
