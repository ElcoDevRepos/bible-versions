It suggests that what follows is a definitive declaration from God, underscoring the seriousness of the message.<p><b>with mocking lips</b><br>The phrase "mocking lips" indicates a tone of derision or scorn. In the context of Isaiah, this reflects the attitude of the Assyrians or Babylonians, who would conquer and oppress Israel. Their language and actions would be a form of divine judgment, as God uses foreign nations to discipline His people. This mocking can also be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given to Israel for their disobedience.<p><b>and foreign tongues,</b><br>"Foreign tongues" refers to languages that are not understood by the Israelites. This is significant because it highlights the alienation and confusion that would come upon Israel as a result of their disobedience. The use of foreign languages is a sign of judgment, as seen in the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>) and later in the New Testament at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-12</a>), where the reversal of this confusion is a sign of the Holy Spirit's work.<p><b>He will speak to this people</b><br>God speaking through foreign nations is a recurring theme in the Bible, where He uses unexpected means to communicate His will and judgment. This phrase indicates that despite Israel's failure to heed God's direct messages through prophets, He will still communicate His purposes, albeit through the actions and languages of foreign conquerors. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also spoke in ways that were unexpected and often misunderstood by the people of His time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
