The owl's presence signifies a place devoid of human habitation, reflecting God's judgment on the land. In the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, this chapter prophesies the destruction of Edom, a nation often at odds with Israel. The imagery of the owl nesting in a desolate area underscores the complete desolation that will come upon Edom as a result of divine judgment.<p><b>she will lay and hatch her eggs and gather her brood under her shadow.</b><br>This imagery of the owl laying and hatching eggs suggests a sense of permanence in the desolation. The land is so forsaken that wildlife can thrive undisturbed. The mention of gathering her brood under her shadow can be seen as a contrast to God's protective care over His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>, where God gathers His people under His wings. Here, it highlights the absence of divine protection for Edom, leaving it to the wild creatures.<p><b>Even there the birds of prey will gather,</b><br>The gathering of birds of prey further emphasizes the theme of desolation and ruin. Birds of prey are often associated with death and destruction, as they feed on carrion. This gathering signifies that the land is not only abandoned by humans but is also a place of death and decay. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>, where birds of prey are used to symbolize judgment and devastation.<p><b>each with its mate.</b><br>The mention of each bird of prey having its mate suggests a natural order and continuation of life, even in a place of judgment. This could imply that while human life and civilization are absent, nature continues its course. It also serves as a stark reminder of the completeness of God's judgment, where even the natural world adapts to the new reality of desolation. This phrase can be seen as a reflection of the order within God's creation, even amidst chaos and destruction, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God establishes order in creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owl.htm">The Owl</a></b><br>Symbolic of desolation and uncleanliness in biblical literature, often associated with deserted places.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_falcons.htm">The Falcons</a></b><br>Birds of prey that signify desolation and the presence of death or destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nest.htm">The Nest</a></b><br>Represents a place of dwelling or habitation, often used metaphorically for security or desolation depending on context.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a> is a prophecy against Edom, representing nations opposed to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of judgment and desolation, often used in the Bible to signify God's wrath and the absence of His blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_judgment.htm">Understanding Divine Judgment</a></b><br><a href="/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a> illustrates the completeness of God's judgment. The presence of owls and falcons signifies total desolation, reminding us of the seriousness of opposing God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_birds.htm">Symbolism of Birds</a></b><br>In biblical symbolism, birds often represent spiritual truths. Here, they signify the aftermath of divine judgment, urging us to reflect on the consequences of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The prophecy against Edom and the imagery of desolation highlight God's control over nations and history.

This encourages us to seek refuge in God rather than face desolation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The desolation described serves as a warning and a call to repentance.

When the Creator says an owl will make her home there, He is painting a literal picture of total human abandonment.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a> records a similar scene over Babylon, &#8220;But desert creatures will lie there&#8221;; <a href="/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Zephaniah 2:14</a> shows owls nesting in Nineveh&#8217;s ruins. Each passage underscores that when God&#8217;s wrath falls, what remains is fit only for wildlife.<p>&#8226; The owl, a bird that thrives in silence and ruin, becomes a living testimony that the area has been emptied of people, fulfilling God&#8217;s word down to the smallest detail (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she will lay and hatch her eggs</b><p>&#8226; Life continues for the creatures God appoints to occupy the waste places.
