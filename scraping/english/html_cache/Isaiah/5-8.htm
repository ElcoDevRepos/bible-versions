The context here is a condemnation of greed and the accumulation of wealth at the expense of others. In ancient Israel, land was a critical resource, and the Law of Moses emphasized the equitable distribution of land among the tribes and families (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>). The practice of adding house to house suggests a violation of this principle, as wealthy landowners were buying up properties, displacing smaller landowners, and disrupting the intended social order. This behavior reflects a disregard for the covenantal laws and a focus on material gain.<p><b>and join field to field</b><br>The joining of field to field further illustrates the expansion of personal estates at the expense of community welfare. This accumulation of land would lead to the creation of large estates, reducing the availability of land for others and increasing economic disparity. The historical context of this practice can be seen in the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where land was the primary means of production and sustenance. This behavior is reminiscent of the actions of Ahab and Jezebel in <a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>, where Naboth's vineyard was unjustly seized, highlighting the abuse of power and disregard for divine law.<p><b>until no place is left</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of the greed and the resulting desolation. The accumulation of land by a few leads to a lack of space and resources for the many, creating social and economic imbalance. This situation is contrary to the Jubilee laws, which were designed to prevent such monopolization and ensure that every family had access to their ancestral land. The prophetic warning here is that such actions will lead to judgment and desolation, as the land itself will suffer from the consequences of human greed.<p><b>and you live alone in the land</b><br>The result of this unchecked greed is isolation. The wealthy landowners, in their pursuit of expansion, end up living alone, having driven others away. This isolation is both physical and spiritual, as it reflects a separation from the community and from God's intended order. The prophetic implication is that such behavior leads to judgment, as seen in the Babylonian exile, where the land was left desolate and the people were removed. This phrase also serves as a warning against the dangers of materialism and the importance of community and stewardship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

Like the flood of Noah&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13</a>) or the destruction of Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), God&#8217;s warnings are not empty; they are historically literal and morally certain.<p>&#8226; The phrase therefore calls every listener to pause, examine the heart, and turn before discipline arrives (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who add house to house</b><p>&#8226; The picture is of people snapping up dwelling after dwelling, creating personal real-estate empires.

The passage calls believers to contentment, stewardship, and love of neighbor, trusting God&#8212;not property&#8212;as the source of security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Woe unto them that join house to house.</span>--The series of "Woes" which follows has no precedent in the teaching of earlier prophets. The form of <a href="/context/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24-26</a> seems based upon it. The general indictment of Isaiah 1 is followed by special counts. That which leads off the list was the destruction of the old village life of Palestine. The original ideal of the nation had been that it should consist of small proprietors; and the Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-13.htm" title="In the year of this jubilee you shall return every man to his possession.">Leviticus 25:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-24.htm" title="In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.">Leviticus 27:24</a>), and the law of the marriage of heiresses (<a href="/context/numbers/27-1.htm" title="Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, Numbers 36, <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm" title="And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.">Numbers 33:54</a>) were intended as safeguards for the maintenance of that ideal. In practice it had broken down, and might had taken the place of right. Landmarks were removed (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-14.htm" title="You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in your inheritance, which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it.">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark.

What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>; <a href="/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. <span class="cmt_word">Till there be no place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till want of place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till there is no room for others.
