In the context of <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>, "him" refers to the Assyrian king Sennacherib, who threatened Jerusalem. The phrase underscores the prophetic role of Isaiah as a mouthpiece for God, delivering a message of judgment against Assyria. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty over nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19</a>, where Assyria is described as an instrument of God's wrath.<p><b>The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you;</b><br>"Virgin Daughter of Zion" is a poetic term for Jerusalem, symbolizing purity and the city's special status as God's chosen place. The use of "virgin" suggests inviolability, despite the Assyrian threat. The imagery of despising and mocking indicates a reversal of fortunes; the once-threatened city now stands in defiance of its oppressor. This reflects the biblical motif of God defending His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, where God laughs at the plans of the wicked. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and protection God provides, a theme fulfilled in Christ's victory over sin and death.<p><b>the Daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you.</b><br>The "Daughter of Jerusalem" is another term for the inhabitants of the city, emphasizing their collective identity and relationship with God. Shaking the head is a gesture of scorn and derision, indicating the Assyrians' defeat and humiliation. This cultural gesture is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, where it signifies mockery. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Assyrian army was miraculously defeated, as recorded in <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>. This event prefigures the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ defeats the forces of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virgin_daughter_of_zion.htm">The Virgin Daughter of Zion</a></b><br>A poetic representation of Jerusalem, symbolizing purity and the chosen status of God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter_of_jerusalem.htm">The Daughter of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Another metaphor for the city of Jerusalem, emphasizing its central role in God's plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who threatened Jerusalem, representing the forces opposed to God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to King Hezekiah and the people of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God is in control, even when His people face powerful adversaries.

The personification here is very effective. since it represents Jerusalem as a tender maiden, weak and delicate, yet still bold enough to stand up against Sennacherib and all his host, and bid him defiance. Confident in Jehovah, her Protector, she despises him, and laughs him to scorn; nay, "shakes her head at him," or rather. "after him," pursuing him with scornful gestures as In. retreats before her.
