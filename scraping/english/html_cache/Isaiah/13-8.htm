In the context of <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, this is a prophecy concerning the judgment against Babylon. The imagery of terror and anguish is often used in the Bible to depict the day of the Lord, a time of divine judgment (<a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>, <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-15</a>). Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire, and its fall would have been a significant event, causing widespread fear and distress among its inhabitants. The use of such language underscores the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>they will writhe like a woman in labor.</b><br>The comparison to a woman in labor is a common biblical metaphor for sudden and intense pain (<a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). This imagery conveys not only the physical agony but also the inevitability and inescapability of the coming judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, childbirth was a time of great vulnerability and uncertainty, further emphasizing the helplessness of those experiencing God's wrath. This metaphor also connects to the broader biblical theme of creation and new beginnings, as labor pains precede birth, suggesting that judgment may lead to a new order or restoration.<p><b>They will look at one another,</b><br>This phrase indicates a communal experience of fear and confusion. In times of crisis, people often seek reassurance from one another, but here, the shared experience only amplifies the terror. This reflects the breakdown of societal structures and the inability of human alliances to provide security against divine judgment. The communal aspect of this fear is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where entire nations or groups face God's wrath, such as the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-23.htm">Exodus 10:23</a>).<p><b>their faces flushed with fear.</b><br>The physical manifestation of fear, with flushed faces, highlights the intensity of the emotion. In biblical times, facial expressions were seen as a reflection of one's inner state (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-6</a>). The flushing of faces can symbolize shame, panic, or overwhelming dread. This vivid imagery serves to emphasize the totality of the judgment and the complete inability of the people to hide or escape their fear. It also connects to the broader theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of resisting His will, as seen in other prophetic writings (<a href="/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

God is describing the sudden, paralyzing dread that will grip Babylon when His judgment falls.<p>&#8226; Terror is not merely psychological; it is a divinely appointed response to divine wrath (<a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The same God who comforts His people (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>) also terrifies the unrepentant, proving His justice.<p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s coming panic mirrors the fear that descended on Egypt during the plagues (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30-33</a>), underscoring that no nation is beyond God&#8217;s reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pain, and anguish will seize them</b><p>The verse intensifies: &#8220;pain, and anguish will seize them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Seize&#8221; pictures these emotions as hunters capturing prey&#8212;inescapable and overpowering (<a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgments strike both body and soul; physical suffering and inward torment blend together (<a href="/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord foretold similar anguish on Edom (<a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7-8</a>) and Moab (<a href="/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4-5</a>), showing a consistent pattern: persistent rebellion invites all-encompassing distress.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will writhe like a woman in labor</b><p>Next comes a vivid simile: &#8220;They will writhe like a woman in labor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Labor pains are sudden, unavoidable, and unstoppable once begun (<a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus employed the same imagery to describe end-time tribulation (<a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>), reinforcing the prophetic harmony of Scripture.<p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s mighty warriors, famed for strength, will double over helplessly&#8212;proof that human power collapses before God&#8217;s decree (<a href="/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear</b><p>Finally, the verse depicts collective shock: &#8220;They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

This mutual alarm contrasts sharply with the calm assurance God gives His people, whose faces &#8220;are never covered with shame&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> paints a four-part portrait of Babylon&#8217;s downfall: sudden terror, overwhelming anguish, agonizing convulsions, and shared, visible fear. Each phrase layers another stroke of judgment, affirming God&#8217;s sovereign control over nations and history. The verse warns every reader that prideful security can vanish in a moment, yet it also highlights the consistent biblical promise that the Lord protects those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall be afraid;</span> rather, <span class="accented">dismayed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them</span>; literally, <span class="accented">they shall take hold of pangs and sorrows</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>They shall be amazed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">look aghast</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Their faces</span> shall be as <span class="cmt_word">flames</span>.
