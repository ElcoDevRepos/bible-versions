In the context of <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, Eliakim is contrasted with Shebna, who was unfaithful. The "glory of his father's house" signifies the honor and burden of leadership. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears the glory and responsibility of His Father's house, the Church. The imagery of "hanging" suggests a firm and secure placement, indicating trust and stability in leadership.<p><b>the descendants and the offshoots&#8212;</b><br>The mention of "descendants and offshoots" implies the comprehensive nature of Eliakim's authority, extending to all members of the household. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's inclusive leadership over all believers, both Jews and Gentiles. The terms suggest a family or clan structure, common in ancient Israel, where leadership affected all members. This reflects the biblical theme of covenantal relationships, where the actions of one can impact many.<p><b>all the lesser vessels,</b><br>"Lesser vessels" refers to the smaller, perhaps more mundane, items within a household. In a spiritual sense, this can symbolize the care and attention given to even the least significant members of God's people. It highlights the comprehensive nature of stewardship, where nothing is too small to be overlooked. This echoes the New Testament teaching that all parts of the body of Christ are valuable, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22-23</a>.<p><b>from bowls to every kind of jar.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the variety and inclusivity of the items under Eliakim's care, from common bowls to various jars. It suggests a meticulous and thorough management of resources. In a broader biblical context, it can be seen as a metaphor for the diverse gifts and roles within the Church, all of which are important for its functioning. The imagery of vessels is also used in the New Testament to describe believers as vessels for honorable use (<a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20-21</a>), indicating the sanctification and purpose found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliakim.htm">Eliakim</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, Eliakim is the servant of God who is appointed to replace Shebna.

God literally entrusted the nation&#8217;s needs to this man; people could confidently &#8220;hang&#8221; their hopes and burdens on him. The scene anticipates Christ, the ultimate Sure Foundation (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1&#8211;6</a>), on whom believers may safely rest every concern (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the glory of his father&#8217;s house</b><p>Everything honorable tied to Eliakim&#8217;s family&#8212;its reputation, resources, influence&#8212;would now rest on his shoulders. Unlike Shebna, who pursued personal glory (<a href="/isaiah/22-16.htm">Isaiah 22:16&#8211;18</a>), Eliakim would carry family honor selflessly, echoing Jesus who bore &#8220;the reproach of many&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>; <a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>) yet also reveals the Father&#8217;s glory (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the descendants and the offshoots</b><p>Isaiah stresses that both the direct heirs (&#8220;descendants&#8221;) and the extended branches (&#8220;offshoots&#8221;) of Eliakim&#8217;s lineage would look to him. In practical terms, every relative&#8212;from the eldest patriarch to the youngest cousin&#8212;would depend on his leadership. This foreshadows how Christ gathers every believer into one family, whether Jew or Gentile, near or far (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar</b><p>Even the smallest, most ordinary utensils of the household would hang on the peg.

From the seemingly insignificant to the highly esteemed, all find secure place in Him, supported without fear of falling (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a> presents God&#8217;s appointed peg, Eliakim, strong enough to carry the full weight of family honor, relatives, and everyday needs.

Not without a touch of irony, as the sequel shows, the prophet paints the extent to which those who belong to Eliakim will hang upon his support. There will be the "glory" or the "weight" (the Hebrew word has both meanings) of his next-of-kin. Besides these there will be the remoter <span class= "ital">off-shoots </span>and <span class= "ital">side-shoots </span>of his family. But the number will increase, and upon that single nail, or peg, would hang the "vessels of small quantity," cups such as were used by the priests for the blood of the victims in sacrificing (<a href="/exodus/24-6.htm" title="And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.">Exodus 24:6</a>), or for wine in common use (Song <a href="/songs/7-2.htm" title="Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.">Song of Solomon 7:2</a>), flagons, or earthen pitchers, as in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-2.htm" title="The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!">Lamentations 4:2</a>, i.e., the whole crowd of the retainers of a great official. The prophet obviously paints the picture as a warning. There was the danger even for Eliakim, upright and religious as he was, as there has been for others like him, of giving way to nepotism, and the fault would not remain unpunished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the glory</span>.
