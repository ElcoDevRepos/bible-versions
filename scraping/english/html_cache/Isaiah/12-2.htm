In the context of Isaiah, this declaration follows the prophecies of judgment and restoration. The term "salvation" here is comprehensive, encompassing deliverance from physical, spiritual, and eternal peril. It reflects the Hebrew understanding of salvation as holistic well-being. This assurance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is identified as the Savior (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>), fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament.<p><b>I will trust and not be afraid.</b><br>Trust in God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, often juxtaposed with fear. In the historical context, Israel faced threats from surrounding nations, and the call to trust in God rather than fear them is a central message. This phrase is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>, where trust in God dispels fear. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>, where believers are encouraged to present their requests to God with thanksgiving, resulting in peace that guards their hearts and minds.<p><b>For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song,</b><br>This phrase draws from the Song of Moses in <a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>, where God is praised for delivering Israel from Egypt. The repetition of "LORD GOD" (Yahweh) emphasizes His covenantal faithfulness and power. The imagery of God as strength suggests reliance on His power rather than human might, a theme seen in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>. The reference to "song" indicates joy and celebration, often associated with God's deliverance and victory, as seen in the Psalms.<p><b>and He also has become my salvation.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a personal and experiential realization of God's saving work. It suggests a transformation where God's deliverance is not just a future hope but a present reality. The phrase "has become" indicates a process or journey of faith, aligning with the Christian understanding of salvation as both an event and a journey. This is seen in the life of Jesus, whose death and resurrection provide the ultimate salvation, fulfilling the prophetic hope expressed in Isaiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

Because God Himself will intervene, salvation is not a vague hope but a settled certainty: &#8220;In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The declaration is personal&#8212;&#8220;my&#8221; salvation&#8212;echoing Jonah&#8217;s cry, &#8220;Salvation comes from the LORD!&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-9.htm">Jonah 2:9</a>). God is not merely the source of rescue; He is the rescue.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s future remnant will sing this, just as every believer can now. <a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a> records the same confidence: &#8220;The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8212;whom shall I fear?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will trust and not be afraid</b><p>&#8226; Trust flows naturally from knowing that God already holds our salvation. &#8220;When I am afraid, I will trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear evaporates in the presence of faith; Christ commands, &#8220;Do not let your hearts be troubled&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah later affirms, &#8220;You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, because he trusts in You&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>). The antidote to fear is conscious, continual reliance on God&#8217;s character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the LORD GOD is my strength</b><p>&#8226; The double divine name (Yah, YHWH) underlines absolute sufficiency. Every victory, endurance, and act of obedience draws on His power, not ours: &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Weakness is no liability when the Lord is strength: &#8220;My power is perfected in weakness&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 12</a>:9).<p>&#8226; Habakkuk echoed the same confidence during crisis: &#8220;GOD the Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my song</b><p>&#8226; Strength experienced becomes praise expressed.

Joyful song is the fitting response to divine strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He also has become my salvation</b><p>&#8226; Isaiah repeats the theme to drive it home: salvation is both promised and realized in the Lord alone. &#8220;The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-14.htm">Psalm 118:14</a>).<p>&#8226; In the gospel this finds ultimate fulfillment: &#8220;Salvation exists in no one else&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>), &#8220;for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan culminates in everlasting deliverance for Israel and the nations: &#8220;Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a> celebrates a God-given rescue so certain that fear melts into faith, weakness turns into strength, and salvation blossoms into song.
