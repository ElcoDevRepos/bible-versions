In biblical times, the "poor" often referred not only to those lacking material wealth but also to those who were humble and dependent on God. The concept of God as a refuge is a recurring theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>) and reflects His role as a protector and provider. This imagery is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern understanding of deities as protectors of their people.<p><b>a stronghold for the needy in distress</b><br>A "stronghold" suggests a fortified place of safety and security. In ancient Israel, cities often had strongholds or fortresses where people could seek protection during times of attack. The "needy in distress" refers to those who are vulnerable and in desperate situations. This phrase emphasizes God's role as a defender and sustainer, similar to how He is described in <a href="/psalms/9-9.htm">Psalm 9:9</a>. The historical context of Isaiah includes periods of war and invasion, making the imagery of a stronghold particularly poignant.<p><b>a refuge from the storm</b><br>The "storm" symbolizes chaos, danger, and overwhelming circumstances. In the ancient world, storms were often seen as manifestations of divine power or judgment. God's ability to provide refuge from such storms underscores His sovereignty and control over creation. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament when Jesus calms the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>, demonstrating His divine authority and protection.<p><b>a shade from the heat</b><br>In the arid climate of the Middle East, "shade" is a powerful metaphor for relief and protection. The "heat" can represent trials, persecution, or the oppressive actions of enemies. This phrase suggests God's provision of comfort and respite, akin to the way He provided a cloud by day for the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). It also foreshadows the eternal rest and protection found in Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-16.htm">Revelation 7:16</a>.<p><b>For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall</b><br>The "breath of the ruthless" refers to the threats and oppressive actions of powerful adversaries. In ancient times, walls were critical for a city's defense, and rain could symbolize both blessing and destruction, depending on the context. Here, the imagery suggests that while the ruthless may seem powerful, their efforts are ultimately futile against God's protection, much like rain that cannot penetrate a solid wall. This reflects the biblical theme of God's ultimate justice and the futility of opposing Him, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

The idea is a little enlarged in <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>. Its germ is, perhaps, to be found in <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5, 6</a>. No writer accumulates striking images with such force and beauty as Isaiah. Primarily, the entire imagery has reference to what God will have done for his people when the final consummation arrives. Secondarily, a precious encouragement is held out to all who are undergoing their earthly trial and probation, who are taught where to look for a sure refuge in time of trouble. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/25-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You have been</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a refuge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wz)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4581.htm">Strong's 4581: </a> </span><span class="str2">A place or means of safety, protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the poor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(lad&#183;d&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
