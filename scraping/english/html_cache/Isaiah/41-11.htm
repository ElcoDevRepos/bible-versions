The term "behold" is a call to attention, indicating the importance of the message. The "rage" against Israel can be seen historically in the numerous nations that opposed them, such as the Assyrians and Babylonians. The promise that these enemies will be "ashamed and disgraced" reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where those who oppose God's chosen people ultimately face humiliation. This is consistent with the covenantal promises found in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants and curse those who curse them.<p><b>those who contend with you will be reduced to nothing and will perish.</b><br>The phrase "contend with you" suggests legal or physical opposition, akin to a courtroom battle or warfare. Historically, Israel faced many adversaries, yet this promise assures them of ultimate victory. The idea of being "reduced to nothing" and perishing underscores the totality of God's judgment against those who oppose His plans. This can be connected to the eschatological themes in Revelation, where God's final victory over evil is assured. Additionally, this reflects the typology of Christ as the ultimate defender and advocate for His people, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
