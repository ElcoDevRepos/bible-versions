The absence of these offerings indicates a neglect of covenantal obligations. Sheep, often used in these sacrifices, symbolize innocence and purity, prefiguring Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The failure to bring these offerings reflects a deeper spiritual apathy and disobedience among the Israelites.<p><b>nor honored Me with your sacrifices</b><br>Sacrifices were meant to honor God, acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. The Israelites' neglect in offering sacrifices suggests a lack of reverence and gratitude. This neglect is not just a failure in ritual but a heart issue, as God desires obedience and a contrite heart over mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of genuine worship over empty religious practices.<p><b>I have not burdened you with offerings</b><br>God emphasizes that He has not imposed excessive demands on His people. The sacrificial system, while detailed, was designed for the people's benefit, to maintain a relationship with God and to foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>). This statement highlights God's grace and the ease of His yoke compared to the burdensome practices of surrounding pagan religions.<p><b>nor wearied you with frankincense</b><br>Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was used in offerings and symbolizes prayer and worship (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). God's statement that He has not wearied them with demands for frankincense suggests that His requirements are reasonable and not meant to be a burden. This reflects God's desire for sincere devotion rather than extravagant displays, aligning with Jesus' teaching on worship in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the Israelites.

All prayer may be regarded as a sort of offering, and withholding it as withholding sacrifice. But it is possible that the prophet is not addressing captive Israel only, but carrying his thoughts back to the period preceding the Captivity, when there was a general neglect of God's service, and for a time the temple was given up to idol-worship (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).
