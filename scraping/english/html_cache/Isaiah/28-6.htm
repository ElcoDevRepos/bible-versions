In the context of ancient Israel, judges and leaders were expected to uphold God's law and administer justice fairly. The "spirit of justice" implies a divine influence or guidance, reminiscent of the wisdom granted to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>). This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true justice originates from God (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the Messianic prophecy of Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect justice (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-4</a>).<p><b>and a strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate</b><br>In ancient cities, gates were strategic points of defense and commerce. The "onslaught at the gate" refers to military attacks or sieges, common in the turbulent history of Israel. The promise of "strength" suggests divine support for those defending the city, akin to the protection God provided to Jerusalem during the Assyrian siege (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-36</a>). This strength can be seen as both physical and spiritual, empowering defenders to withstand external threats. Theologically, it points to God's role as a protector and deliverer, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to stand firm against spiritual adversaries (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Scripture shows this pattern repeatedly: &#8220;He has told you, O man, what is good&#8212;and what does the LORD require of you but to act justly&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). When the Spirit of the LORD came upon leaders like Othniel (<a href="/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>) or Jehoshaphat&#8217;s judges (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6-7</a>), impartial decisions followed. The same Spirit who empowered Solomon to discern rightly (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>) is promised here to steady Israel&#8217;s courts once more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to him who sits in judgment</b><p>The phrase pinpoints those occupying the bench or city gate, places where legal matters were settled (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). God pledges to supply every righteous judge with discernment that aligns with His own character. <a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1-2</a> pictures this: &#8220;Grant the king Your justice, O God&#8230;may he judge Your people with righteousness.&#8221; In Isaiah&#8217;s context, corrupt leaders had erred (<a href="/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>), yet the Lord offers real, literal intervention&#8212;He Himself becoming their resource for upright verdicts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a strength</b><p>The second half of verse 6 shifts from courts to combat: the LORD is &#8220;a strength.&#8221; The word evokes steady endurance and victorious power. David sang, &#8220;The LORD is my strength and my shield&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7</a>); Isaiah echoes that assurance. The same divine might that split the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>) stands ready to fortify His people when danger presses in.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those who repel the onslaught at the gate</b><p>City gates were the first target in an invasion (<a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>). Defenders needed courage, skill, and stamina. Here God pledges to be the literal backbone of every soldier on the wall. Nehemiah encouraged his builders in similar language: &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230;remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14</a>). Ultimately, Christ embodies this promise&#8212;He is the conquering King who &#8220;judges and wages war&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>), ensuring that no enemy prevails against His people (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/28-6.htm">Isaiah 28:6</a> assures God&#8217;s people that He personally steps in when leadership and safety hang in the balance.
