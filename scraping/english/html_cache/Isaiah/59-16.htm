In the context of Isaiah, the nation was steeped in sin and injustice, and there was no one righteous enough to intercede on behalf of the people. This echoes the situation in <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, where God sought someone to stand in the breach but found none. The phrase underscores the pervasive sinfulness of humanity and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>He was amazed that there was no one to intercede.</b><br>God's amazement here is not due to a lack of foresight but rather emphasizes the gravity of the situation. Intercession was a critical role in Israelite society, often performed by prophets, priests, or righteous leaders. The absence of an intercessor points to the spiritual decline of the nation. This also foreshadows the ultimate intercessor, Jesus Christ, who stands between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>So His own arm brought salvation,</b><br>The "arm" of the Lord is a metaphor for His power and might. In the absence of a human intercessor, God Himself steps in to bring salvation. This reflects the theme of divine intervention found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, where God promises to deliver Israel with an outstretched arm. It also prefigures the work of Christ, who is often seen as the embodiment of God's saving power (<a href="/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>).<p><b>and His own righteousness sustained Him.</b><br>God's righteousness is the foundation of His actions. Unlike human righteousness, which is flawed and inconsistent, God's righteousness is perfect and unchanging. This righteousness not only sustains Him but also ensures the fulfillment of His promises. In the New Testament, this righteousness is imputed to believers through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, observing the lack of righteousness and intercession among His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Implicitly referenced as those who have failed to intercede or uphold justice, leading to God's intervention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arm_of_the_lord.htm">The Arm of the Lord</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and intervention, often associated with deliverance and salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/intercession.htm">Intercession</a></b><br>The act of intervening or mediating on behalf of others, which was lacking among the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_and_righteousness.htm">Salvation and Righteousness</a></b><br>Key themes in this verse, highlighting God's initiative in bringing about redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_intercessors.htm">The Need for Intercessors</a></b><br>God values intercession and looks for those who will stand in the gap for others.
