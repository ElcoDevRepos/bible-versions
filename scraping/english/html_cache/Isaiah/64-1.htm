The imagery of "rending the heavens" suggests a dramatic and powerful act of God breaking through the barriers between heaven and earth. This reflects the Israelites' desire for God to manifest His presence in a tangible way, reminiscent of past theophanies such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18-20</a>). The plea for God to "come down" indicates a yearning for His immediate and personal involvement in the affairs of His people, highlighting their dependence on His power and presence. This echoes the messianic hope for God to dwell among His people, ultimately fulfilled in the incarnation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>so that mountains would quake at Your presence</b><br>The quaking of mountains symbolizes the overwhelming power and majesty of God. In biblical literature, mountains often represent stability and permanence, yet they tremble before the Creator (<a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>). This imagery recalls instances where God's presence caused natural phenomena, such as the shaking of Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and the splitting of the Mount of Olives prophesied in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>. The quaking serves as a metaphor for the transformative impact of God's presence, which can alter the natural order and bring about significant change. It also foreshadows the eschatological shaking of the heavens and the earth, as described in <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>, pointing to the ultimate establishment of God's unshakeable kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, speaking to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, calling them to repentance and hope in God's deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>The sky or the realm above the earth, often seen as the dwelling place of God in biblical literature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic of stability and strength, often representing obstacles or challenges that can be moved by God's power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence.htm">God's Presence</a></b><br>The manifestation of God's power and glory, which Isaiah longs to see in a tangible and transformative way.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, facing impending judgment and in need of divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/longing_for_divine_intervention.htm">Longing for Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Isaiah's cry reflects a deep yearning for God to intervene in the world.

It invites believers to anticipate and trust the same decisive, earth-shaking intervention of the living God today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/64.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>LXIV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Oh that thou wouldest rend . . .</span>--The division of chapters hinders the English reader from seeing that this is really a continuation of the prayer of <a href="/context/isaiah/63-15.htm" title="Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where is your zeal and your strength, the sounding of your bowels and of your mercies toward me? are they restrained?">Isaiah 63:15-19</a>.

Not content with praying God to look upon them once more with favour (<a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>), Israel now asks for a theophany, or manifestation of the Divine Presence, such as they have experienced in the times of old, and such as shall suffice to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies (vers. 1-4). With profound humility confessing their manifold and grievous iniquities, they beseech God once more, as their Father and Maker, to have pity upon them, reminding him of the desolate condition of Judaea and Jerusalem, and urging him no longer to "refrain himself" (vers. 5-12). "The manner," as Mr. Cheyne observes, "is that of a liturgical psalm; the prophet, as it were, leads the devotions of the assembled Church," and utters in impassioned language the feelings which deeply move them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wouldest rend the</span> <span class="cmt_word">heavens!</span> God "dwells in the thick darkness" (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-1.htm">2 Chronicles 6:1</a>). "Thick clouds are a covering to him" as he "walketh in the circuit of heaven" (<a href="/job/22-14.htm">Job 22:14</a>). The Church would have the covering "rent," and God show himself openly, both to his people and to their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">That thou wouldest come down!</span> God" came down" ou Sinai in the sight of all the people (<a href="/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11, 20</a>). David saw him in vision "bow the heavens and <span class="accented">come down</span>; and there was darkness under his feet" (<a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>). It is such an "epiphany" which the Church now desires - a revelation of God in all his glory, in his might as against "the nations" (ver. 2), in his mercifulness as towards themselves. <span class="cmt_word">That the mountains might flow down</span>; or, <span class="accented">quake.</span> When God descended on Sinai, "the whole mount quaked greatly" (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). When he appeared to David, "the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken" (<a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). When he was seen of Elijah, "a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; and after the wind was an earthquake" (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). Micah saw the Lord "coming forth out of his place," and "the mountains were molten under him, and the valleys cleft" (<a href="/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3, 4</a>). The mountains represent that which is most firm and solid and strong upon the face of the earth. If even they "melt and flow and tremble" at the presence of God, what might must his be!
