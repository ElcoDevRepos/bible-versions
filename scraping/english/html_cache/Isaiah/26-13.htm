The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This is a reminder of the covenant established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and later reaffirmed through Moses. It reflects the monotheistic belief central to Israel's identity, distinguishing them from surrounding polytheistic cultures.<p><b>other lords besides You have ruled over us</b><br>Historically, Israel experienced domination by various foreign powers, such as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, and later Persia. This phrase can be seen as a confession of the times when Israel was subject to these nations, often as a result of their disobedience to God. It also reflects the spiritual reality of idolatry, where Israel turned to other gods, thus allowing these "lords" to rule over them. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel's unfaithfulness leads to oppression by foreign rulers.<p><b>but Your name alone do we confess</b><br>This is a declaration of exclusive allegiance to God, rejecting the authority of any other "lords." The "name" of God represents His character, authority, and presence. Confessing His name alone signifies repentance and a return to the worship of the one true God. This aligns with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for the love and worship of God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of salvation and lordship found in Jesus Christ, where believers are called to confess His name above all others (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
