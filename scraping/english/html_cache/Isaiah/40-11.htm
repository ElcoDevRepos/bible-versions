Shepherding was a familiar occupation in ancient Israel, and the role of a shepherd was to guide, protect, and care for the sheep. This metaphor emphasizes God's care and guidance for His people. <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> is a well-known passage that also uses this imagery, portraying the Lord as a shepherd who provides and protects. In the New Testament, Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), fulfilling this Old Testament imagery and highlighting His role in caring for and leading His followers.<p><b>He gathers the lambs in His arms</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the tenderness and compassion of God. Lambs are often seen as vulnerable and in need of special care, symbolizing those who are weak or young in faith. The act of gathering them in His arms suggests a personal and intimate care, reflecting God's love and protection. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus shows compassion for the weak and marginalized, such as in <a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12-14</a>, where He speaks of leaving the ninety-nine sheep to find the one that is lost.<p><b>and carries them close to His heart.</b><br>Carrying the lambs close to His heart signifies deep affection and love. This phrase highlights the intimate relationship between God and His people, suggesting that they are cherished and valued. The heart is often seen as the seat of emotions, and this imagery conveys the depth of God's love. In the New Testament, Jesus' love for humanity is demonstrated through His sacrificial death on the cross, as seen in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where He speaks of laying down His life for His friends.<p><b>He gently leads the nursing ewes.</b><br>This phrase underscores the gentle and considerate nature of God's leadership. Nursing ewes, or mother sheep, require special attention as they care for their young. The gentle leading suggests a sensitivity to their needs and a careful guidance that does not overwhelm or harm. This reflects God's understanding and patience with His people. In the New Testament, Jesus' approach to leadership is characterized by humility and service, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, where He invites those who are weary to take His yoke upon them, for He is gentle and humble in heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherd.htm">The Shepherd</a></b><br>Represents God, who is depicted as a caring and protective shepherd over His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Symbolizes the people of God, often used to describe the Israelites and, by extension, believers in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lambs.htm">The Lambs</a></b><br>Represents the vulnerable and young members of the flock, indicating those who are weak or in need of special care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nursing_ewes.htm">The Nursing Ewes</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who are nurturing and providing for others, possibly leaders or mature believers within the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart.htm">The Heart</a></b><br>While not a person or place, the heart signifies the deep love and compassion God has for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_tender_care.htm">God's Tender Care</a></b><br>Just as a shepherd tends to his flock, God provides for our needs with tenderness and compassion.

His leadership adapts to each stage of life, fulfilling <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Christ offers a yoke that is &#8220;easy&#8221; and a burden &#8220;light.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> paints a four-fold portrait of the LORD: an attentive Shepherd, a rescuing Gatherer, a loving Carrier, and a gentle Leader.

The tender care of the shepherd for the ewes and lambs finds a parallel in Jacob's pleas (<a href="/genesis/33-13.htm" title="And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.">Genesis 33:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall feed his flock like a shepherd</span>. The similitude is a favourite one with the psalmists (<a href="/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), and occurs again later on in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/49-9.htm">Isaiah 49:9, 10</a>). Its beauty and sweetness have been widely recognized. <span class="cmt_word">He shall gather the lambs</span>; collect them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, when they have strayed from the flock. <span class="cmt_word">Shall gently lead those that are with young</span>; rather, <span class="accented">those that give suck</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/33-3.htm">Genesis 33:3</a>, where the same word is used).
