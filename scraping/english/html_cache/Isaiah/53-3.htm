In the historical context, the Jewish people were expecting a triumphant king, not a suffering servant. This rejection is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is often met with disbelief and hostility (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). The term "despised" indicates a deep contempt, reflecting how Jesus was treated by the religious leaders and many of His contemporaries. This rejection fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant, showing that the Messiah would not be recognized or honored by His own people.<p><b>A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief</b><br>This description emphasizes the Messiah's deep empathy and identification with human suffering. The term "sorrows" can be understood as both physical and emotional pain, which Jesus experienced throughout His life and ministry. His acquaintance with grief is seen in His compassion for the sick, the mourning, and the oppressed (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate sorrow and grief He would bear on the cross, taking on the sins of humanity (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<p><b>Like one from whom men hide their faces</b><br>This imagery suggests a reaction of shame or avoidance, indicating that people would turn away from the Messiah, unable or unwilling to face His suffering and the truth He represented. This can be seen in the Gospels, where many, including His own disciples, abandoned Jesus during His trial and crucifixion (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>). The hiding of faces also symbolizes humanity's rejection of God's revelation through Christ.<p><b>He was despised, and we esteemed Him not</b><br>Reiterating the earlier sentiment, this phrase underscores the lack of recognition and honor given to the Messiah. Despite His divine nature and mission, Jesus was not valued or respected by those He came to save. This lack of esteem is a reflection of humanity's spiritual blindness and hardness of heart (<a href="/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11-12</a>). The repetition of "despised" emphasizes the depth of rejection, while "we esteemed Him not" highlights the collective failure to acknowledge His true identity and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suffering_servant.htm">The Suffering Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Christians traditionally interpret as prophetic references to Jesus Christ.

His prophecies often pointed to the coming Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The original audience of Isaiah's prophecies, who were in need of hope and redemption during times of turmoil and exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rejection.htm">Understanding Rejection</a></b><br>Jesus' experience of being "despised and rejected" reminds us that rejection is a part of the Christian journey.

Men have sometimes raised the rather idle question whether the body of our Lord was subject to disease, and have decided on <span class= "ital">a priori </span>grounds that it was not. The prophet's words point to the true view, that this was an essential condition of His fellowship with humanity.

At the end, even his apostles "forsook him, and fled" (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A Man of sorrows</span>. The word translated "sorrows" means also pains of any kind. But the beautiful rendering of our version may well stand, since there are many places where the word used certainly means "sorrow" and nothing else (see <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/6-29.htm">2 Chronicles 6:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/38-17.htm">Psalm 38:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-15.htm">Jeremiah 30:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12, 18</a>, etc.).

The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore be retained. <span class="cmt_word">We hid as it were our faces from him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there was as it were the hiding of the face from him.</span> Some suppose the hiding of God's face to be intended; but the context, which describes the treatment of the Servant by his fellow-men, makes the meaning given in our version far preferable. Men turned their faces from him when they met him, would not see him, would not recognize him (comp. <a href="/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-17</a>; <a href="/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). Despised.
