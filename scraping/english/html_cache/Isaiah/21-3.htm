The use of "body" indicates that the distress is not only spiritual but also physical, suggesting a holistic suffering. This anguish is often associated with the burden of prophetic revelation, as seen in other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/21-6.htm">Ezekiel 21:6-7</a>). The context of <a href="/isaiah/21.htm">Isaiah 21</a> is a prophecy against Babylon, and the anguish could be due to the impending judgment and destruction that Isaiah foresees.<p><b>Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor.</b><br>The comparison to labor pains is a vivid metaphor for intense and unavoidable suffering. Labor pains are recurrent in biblical literature to describe sudden and inevitable distress (<a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). This imagery emphasizes the severity and inevitability of the coming judgment. In a broader biblical context, labor pains can also symbolize the birth of a new era or divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, where creation groans in labor pains awaiting redemption.<p><b>I am bewildered to hear,</b><br>The bewilderment Isaiah experiences upon hearing the message suggests a revelation that is both unexpected and overwhelming. This reaction underscores the gravity of the prophecy concerning Babylon's fall. The bewilderment can also reflect the human struggle to comprehend divine plans, as God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The auditory aspect of the revelation highlights the importance of hearing in prophetic experiences, as faith comes by hearing the word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>I am dismayed to see.</b><br>The dismay upon seeing indicates a vision that is both shocking and distressing. This visual component of the prophecy complements the auditory revelation, providing a fuller, more immersive experience of the divine message. The dismay can be linked to the prophet's empathy and compassion for those who will suffer, reflecting God's own sorrow over judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>). The dual sensory experience of hearing and seeing aligns with other prophetic encounters, such as those of Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>), where the overwhelming nature of divine visions leads to physical and emotional responses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who received and conveyed the vision.

The judgment is so real that it hits the prophet&#8217;s own body.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows God&#8217;s messengers overwhelmed by what they see: &#8220;My anguish, my anguish! &#8230; I cannot keep silent&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>); &#8220;I heard and trembled within&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal pain underscores both the certainty of the calamity and the prophet&#8217;s compassion for those who will suffer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pain grips me</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pain grips me&#8221; pictures an instant, uncontrollable seizing. The same word-picture appears when Zion faces siege: &#8220;Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/48-6.htm">Psalm 48:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word is not sterile information; it pierces heart and body. Like Ezekiel, who &#8220;sat overwhelmed&#8221; for seven days (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>), Isaiah cannot distance himself from what God reveals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like the pains of a woman in labor</b><p>&#8226; Labor pains are sudden, unavoidable, and intensify until delivery. Isaiah chooses this image because Babylon&#8217;s doom will arrive the same way&#8212;inescapable and progressively worse until it is finished (cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The metaphor also hints that God&#8217;s judgments ultimately &#8220;birth&#8221; His purposes. After sorrow comes a new chapter, just as Jesus said: &#8220;When a woman is in labor, she has sorrow &#8230; but when she has delivered the child, she no longer remembers the anguish&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am bewildered to hear</b><p>&#8226; The sounds of invasion&#8212;shouts, weapons, cries&#8212;leave the prophet reeling. Daniel had a similar sensory overload: &#8220;I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision &#8230; I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; no strength remained&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Bewilderment shows how far human understanding falls short when confronted with divine holiness and wrath (<a href="/ezekiel/21-6.htm">Ezekiel 21:6&#8211;7</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s confusion invites the reader to seek clarity in God rather than in human insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am dismayed to see</b><p>&#8226; What Isaiah sees is so devastating that it shatters him emotionally. Habakkuk asked, &#8220;Why do You make me look at injustice? Why do You tolerate wrongdoing?&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The reaction validates the vision&#8217;s authenticity: a true prophet does not relish judgment; he mourns it. John felt the same horror when witnessing Babylon&#8217;s fall: &#8220;They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, saying, &#8216;Woe, woe, O great city&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a> records the prophet&#8217;s bodily and emotional collapse under the weight of God&#8217;s revelation. His anguish, gripping pain, labor-like contractions, bewilderment, and dismay together convey how certain, severe, and near Babylon&#8217;s judgment is. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s Word is alive and powerful, touching spirit, soul, and body. It calls us to share God&#8217;s heart&#8212;hating sin, feeling sorrow over its consequences, and trusting that even His fierce judgments are part of His righteous, redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Therefore are my loins filled with pain . . .</span>--Comp. <a href="/nahum/2-10.htm" title="She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melts, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.">Nahum 2:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/21-6.htm" title="Sigh therefore, you son of man, with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.">Ezekiel 21:6</a>; and for the image of the "woman in travail," <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm" title="And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm" title="Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?">Jeremiah 30:6</a>.
