The term "Maker" emphasizes God's role as Creator, reminding the Israelites of their origins and dependence on Him. This forgetfulness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel often turns away from God despite His continuous faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>). The call to remember God is a call to return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth</b><br>This phrase underscores God's omnipotence and sovereignty as the Creator of the universe. The imagery of stretching out the heavens and laying the earth's foundations is common in biblical poetry (<a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>) and serves to remind the people of God's unmatched power and authority. It contrasts the transient nature of human oppressors with the eternal and unchanging nature of God.<p><b>You live in terror all day long because of the fury of the oppressor who is bent on destruction</b><br>Here, the text addresses the fear and anxiety experienced by the Israelites due to their enemies. Historically, this could refer to the Babylonian captivity or other periods of oppression. The oppressor's fury is depicted as relentless, causing the people to live in constant fear. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people facing persecution but also serves as a reminder of God's ultimate deliverance (<a href="/exodus/3-9.htm">Exodus 3:9</a>).<p><b>But where is the fury of the oppressor?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the perceived power of the oppressor, suggesting its temporary nature. It implies that the oppressor's fury is insignificant compared to God's power and promises. This echoes other scriptures where God assures His people of deliverance and the eventual downfall of their enemies (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-11.htm">Isaiah 41:11-12</a>).
