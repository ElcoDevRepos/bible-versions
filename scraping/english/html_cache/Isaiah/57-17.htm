Greed is seen as idolatry (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>), placing material wealth above God. In the context of Isaiah, Israel's leaders and people were often guilty of greed, leading to social injustice and idolatry. God's anger is not arbitrary but a response to the violation of His covenant and moral order.<p><b>so I struck him and hid My face in anger</b><br>God's response to sin is both corrective and punitive. Striking implies discipline, akin to a father disciplining a child (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Hiding His face signifies the withdrawal of His presence and favor, a severe consequence for Israel, who relied on God's guidance and protection. This reflects the covenantal relationship where disobedience leads to divine judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17-18</a>). The hiding of God's face is a theme seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>, indicating a period of spiritual desolation.<p><b>yet he kept turning back to the desires of his heart</b><br>Despite God's discipline, the people persist in their sinful ways, illustrating the stubbornness of the human heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of human rebellion and the tendency to revert to sin despite experiencing God's correction. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of Israel's repeated cycle of sin, judgment, repentance, and restoration. The desires of the heart are often contrary to God's will, necessitating a transformation that only God can bring about (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).

Among the sins that angered God most against the Jews of the later kingdom of Judah was their covetousness - that desire of unjust gain which led them continually to oppress their weaker brethren, to remove their neighbours' landmarks, to harass them with lawsuits, to obtain from the courts corrupt judgments against them, and so to strip them of their inheritances (see <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5, 14, 15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>, etc.). This was far from being their only sin; but it was their besetting sin, and it led on to a number of others. It would seem even to have been the principal cause of those judicial murders with which they are so constantly taxed by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15, 21</a>: 33:15; 59:3; <a href="/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>; <a href="/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>; <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>). Isaiah selects the sin of covetousness here, as typical or representative of the entire class of Judah's besetting sins - the most striking indication of that alienation of their hearts from God, which constituted their real guilt, and was the true cause of their punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And smote him</span>.
