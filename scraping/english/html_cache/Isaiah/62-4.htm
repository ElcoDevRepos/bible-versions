Historically, Israel experienced periods of exile and abandonment due to their disobedience to God. The term "Forsaken" reflects the nation's previous state of being deserted and judged. This promise of no longer being called "Forsaken" indicates a restoration and renewal of the covenant relationship with God, emphasizing His mercy and faithfulness.<p><b>nor your land named Desolate</b><br>The land of Israel, often ravaged by war and left barren, was seen as desolate during times of judgment. This phrase promises a reversal of that condition. The land, once stripped of its inhabitants and productivity, will be restored to a place of abundance and blessing. This transformation is a physical manifestation of God's favor and a return to the land's intended purpose as a place of prosperity and divine presence.<p><b>but you will be called Hephzibah</b><br>"Hephzibah" means "My delight is in her." This name change signifies God's renewed pleasure and favor towards His people. It reflects a deep, personal relationship between God and Israel, where He takes joy in them as a cherished possession. This name is also historically significant, as Hephzibah was the name of King Hezekiah's wife, symbolizing a royal and beloved status.<p><b>and your land Beulah</b><br>"Beulah" means "married." This term indicates a covenantal relationship, suggesting that the land will be united with God in a bond similar to marriage. It implies stability, fruitfulness, and a permanent dwelling place for God's people. The imagery of marriage is often used in Scripture to describe the relationship between God and His people, highlighting commitment and love.<p><b>for the LORD will take delight in you</b><br>This phrase underscores the reason for the transformation: God's delight. It emphasizes His active role in the redemption and restoration of His people. The delight of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with His pleasure in righteousness and faithfulness. This delight is not based on Israel's merit but on God's grace and sovereign choice.<p><b>and your land will be His bride</b><br>The imagery of the land as God's bride conveys a deep, intimate relationship. It suggests a future where the land is not only restored but also elevated to a place of honor and closeness with God. This metaphor of marriage is used throughout the Bible to describe the union between God and His people, ultimately pointing to the relationship between Christ and the Church as seen in the New Testament. This prophetic vision anticipates a time of ultimate reconciliation and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hephzibah.htm">Hephzibah</a></b><br>This name means "My delight is in her" in Hebrew.

It had come to be spoken of as <span class="accented">Sh'marnah</span>, "a desolation" (see <a href="/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2, 6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>). Now all should be altered. As Ezekiel prophesied, "The land that was <span class="accented">desolate</span> is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited" (<a href="/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my delight is in her." Hephzi-bah was the name of Hezekiah's queen, Manasseh's mother (<a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy land Beulah</span>. Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means "married" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). Judaea would be "married" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her. The Hebrew verb toe "to marry" (as a man marries) means literally "to be lord over." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/62-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">longer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will you be called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1461;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Forsaken,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;z&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5805.htm">Strong's 5805: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forsakenness, desolation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">nor your land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
