In the context of Isaiah, the prophet addresses the leaders and people of Israel, who are often depicted as stubborn and resistant to divine instruction. This rhetorical question highlights their spiritual immaturity and unwillingness to heed God's word. The broader biblical narrative frequently emphasizes the importance of being teachable and receptive to God's wisdom, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which underscores the fear of the Lord as the beginning of knowledge.<p><b>To whom is He explaining His message?</b><br>The message refers to God's revelation and instruction, which the people of Israel are failing to grasp. Historically, the Israelites had access to the Law and the Prophets, yet they often ignored or misunderstood these teachings. This phrase underscores the disconnect between God's clear communication and the people's lack of understanding. The New Testament echoes this theme, as Jesus often spoke in parables to those who were spiritually blind or deaf, as seen in <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>.<p><b>To infants just weaned from milk?</b><br>This imagery of infants suggests a lack of maturity and readiness to digest more complex teachings. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, weaning typically occurred around the age of three, marking a transition from dependence to a degree of independence. Spiritually, this metaphor criticizes the Israelites for their inability to move beyond basic teachings. The Apostle Paul uses similar imagery in <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</a>, where he chastises the Corinthian church for needing milk rather than solid food, indicating their spiritual immaturity.<p><b>To babies removed from the breast?</b><br>This phrase reinforces the previous metaphor, emphasizing the people's spiritual infancy and inability to comprehend deeper truths. In the biblical context, being "removed from the breast" signifies a stage where one should be growing and learning, yet the Israelites remain stagnant. This critique is consistent with the broader biblical theme of growth in faith and understanding, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>, which calls believers to progress from elementary teachings to maturity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

A sudden and abrupt transition. The best explanation seems to be that suggested by Jerome, and followed by Bishop Lowth and most commentators, viz. that the prophet dramatically introduces his adversaries as replying to him with taunting speeches. "Whom does he think he is teaching?" they ask. "Mere children, just weaned from their mother's milk, and taken away from the breast? Does he forget that we are grown men - nay, priests and prophets? And what poor teaching it is! What 'endless petty feazing'! (Delitzsch) - precept upon precept," etc. The intention is to throw ridicule upon the smallness and vexatious character of the prophet's interminable and uninterrupted chidings (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge... doctrine</span>.
