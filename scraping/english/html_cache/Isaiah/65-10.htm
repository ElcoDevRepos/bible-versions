In biblical times, it was a symbol of beauty and abundance. The transformation of Sharon into a pasture for flocks signifies a return to prosperity and peace, contrasting with previous desolation due to judgment. This imagery reflects God's promise of restoration and blessing for His people. The mention of flocks suggests pastoral care and provision, echoing themes found in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd providing for His sheep.<p><b>and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds</b><br>The Valley of Achor, meaning "trouble," is historically associated with the sin of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where Achan's disobedience led to Israel's defeat and his subsequent punishment. The transformation of this valley into a resting place for herds symbolizes redemption and hope, turning a place of past judgment into one of peace and rest. This change signifies God's ability to bring good out of past failures and His desire to restore His people. The concept of rest is significant in Scripture, pointing to the ultimate rest found in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>.<p><b>for My people who seek Me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the conditional nature of the promise: it is for those who actively seek God. Seeking God involves a sincere pursuit of His will, presence, and righteousness, as highlighted in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> and <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>. The promise of restoration and blessing is reserved for those who turn to God with genuine hearts. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where blessings are contingent upon faithfulness and devotion. The call to seek God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, urging believers to prioritize their relationship with Him above all else.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sharon.htm">Sharon</a></b><br>A fertile plain located in the western part of ancient Israel, known for its beauty and productivity.
