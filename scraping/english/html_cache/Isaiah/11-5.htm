In biblical times, a belt was an essential part of a soldier's armor, holding everything together and providing readiness for action. Righteousness, in this context, signifies moral integrity and justice, qualities that are foundational to the Messiah's rule. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to "stand firm, then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist." The belt symbolizes preparedness and the central role of righteousness in the life of a believer, as well as in the governance of the Messiah. The Messiah's righteousness is not only personal but also extends to His administration of justice, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where He judges with righteousness.<p><b>and faithfulness the sash around His waist</b><br>Faithfulness here complements righteousness, indicating reliability and steadfastness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a sash was often worn by those in positions of authority, symbolizing their commitment to their duties. The Messiah's faithfulness assures that He will fulfill God's promises and remain true to His word. This is a reflection of God's own faithfulness, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, which speaks of God keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations. The Messiah embodies this divine faithfulness, ensuring that His reign will be marked by unwavering commitment to truth and justice. This faithfulness is also a type of Christ, who is described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a> as "Faithful and True," highlighting His role as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's prophecies often pointed to the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah</a></b><br>This verse is a prophecy concerning the Messiah, who Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
