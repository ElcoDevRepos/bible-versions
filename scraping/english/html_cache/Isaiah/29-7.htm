This phrase suggests a coalition of nations coming against Jerusalem, a common theme in biblical prophecy. Historically, Jerusalem faced numerous sieges, notably by the Assyrians and Babylonians. This imagery of many nations aligns with the prophetic visions of end-times battles, such as those found in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8-9</a>, where nations gather against God's people.<p><b>even all who war against her,</b><br>This emphasizes the totality of the opposition against Jerusalem. Throughout history, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict, symbolizing the spiritual battle between God's kingdom and worldly powers. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate spiritual warfare described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded that their struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<p><b>laying siege and attacking her&#8212;</b><br>The imagery of siege warfare was well-known in the ancient Near East, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This tactic was used by the Assyrians and Babylonians against Jerusalem. Theologically, this can represent the pressures and trials faced by God's people, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>, where Paul speaks of being hard-pressed but not crushed.<p><b>will be like a dream,</b><br>This phrase suggests the futility and temporary nature of the nations' efforts against Jerusalem. In biblical literature, dreams often symbolize things that are fleeting or insubstantial. This can be connected to <a href="/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>, where the wicked are described as being like a dream when one awakes, emphasizing the transient nature of their power.<p><b>like a vision in the night,</b><br>Visions in the night can be mysterious and elusive, often lacking substance upon waking. This imagery underscores the idea that the threats against Jerusalem, though seemingly real and formidable, will ultimately prove to be illusory and ineffective. This can be linked to the assurance found in <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, where it is promised that no weapon formed against God's people will prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ariel.htm">Ariel</a></b><br>A symbolic name for Jerusalem, meaning "Lion of God" in Hebrew.

Scripture often warns that the people of God may face overwhelming odds (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>- The literal force is that every power arrayed against Jerusalem is seen by God. No army slips under His radar (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>- For believers today, this reminds us that the number of enemies does not unsettle the Lord who counts the very hairs of our heads (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Going out to battle against Ariel</b><p>- &#8220;Ariel&#8221; is a poetic name for Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). The city stands for God&#8217;s covenant people.<p>- The verse portrays purposeful aggression: they are not drifting toward conflict; they march &#8220;to battle.&#8221; Compare the Assyrian threat in <a href="/bsb/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36&#8211;37</a> and the final coalition foretold in <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>.<p>- God sees every hostile plan against His people&#8212;ancient or modern&#8212;and allows none to proceed beyond His decree (<a href="/job/38-11.htm">Job 38:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even all who war against her</b><p>- Repetition drives the point home: every single combatant, commander, and conspiracy is included.<p>- <a href="/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4&#8211;5</a> records similar language of united hatred, yet God turned those plots to confusion (<a href="/psalms/83-13.htm">Psalm 83:13&#8211;18</a>).<p>- The church likewise faces &#8220;the whole world&#8221; at times (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>), yet Christ promises &#8220;the gates of Hades will not prevail&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laying siege and attacking her</b><p>- Siege imagery shows prolonged, organized hostility&#8212;economic strangulation, psychological warfare, assault towers.<p>- Historically, Jerusalem endured such sieges (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/luke/21-20.htm">Luke 21:20</a>). God&#8217;s Word records these events so we grasp the severity&#8212;and His subsequent deliverance.<p>- Today, believers may feel hemmed in by cultural or spiritual siege lines, yet <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> assures us, &#8220;The Angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be like a dream, like a vision in the night</b><p>- The point: God reduces terrifying armies to fleeting, insubstantial images. When morning comes, they are gone (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36&#8211;37</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/73-19.htm">Psalm 73:19</a> echoes, &#8220;How suddenly they are brought to desolation! Completely swept away by terrors!&#8221;<p>- <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19&#8211;21</a> shows the final fulfillment: global rebellion ends instantly under Christ&#8217;s word. What seems formidable evaporates at the Lord&#8217;s command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a> assures that however numerous, determined, and organized the foes of God&#8217;s people may be, the Lord regards them as momentary illusions. Their sieges and attacks are real enough to test faith, yet God&#8217;s sovereign intervention turns their efforts into night-time dreams&#8212;startling for a moment, gone by dawn. For every generation of believers, the verse offers sturdy confidence: stand with the Lord, and every enemy coalition, no matter how vast, will prove transient before His unfailing power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Against her and her munition.</span>--The word is a rare one, but probably stands here for the new fortifications by which Uzziah and Hezekiah had defended Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her munition</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her defenses the walls and towers in which she put her trust (comp. ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">As a dream of a night vision</span>.
