The "chief commander" refers to a high-ranking military officer in the Assyrian army. The Assyrian Empire was known for its powerful and organized military structure, which played a significant role in its expansion and dominance in the ancient Near East. The mention of a specific military leader highlights the importance of the event and its impact on the surrounding nations.<p><b>sent by Sargon king of Assyria</b><br>Sargon II was a prominent king of Assyria who reigned from 722 to 705 BC. His reign was marked by military campaigns that expanded Assyrian control over various regions, including parts of the Levant. Sargon's involvement in the events at Ashdod underscores the geopolitical tensions of the time, as Assyria sought to assert its influence over rebellious territories. This historical context is crucial for understanding the broader narrative of Isaiah, which often addresses the threat of Assyrian aggression.<p><b>came to Ashdod</b><br>Ashdod was one of the major Philistine cities located along the coastal plain of modern-day Israel. It was strategically significant due to its location on trade routes and its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. The city's capture by Assyria would have been a significant blow to the Philistine confederation and a demonstration of Assyrian power. The mention of Ashdod connects this passage to the broader theme of God's judgment on the nations surrounding Israel.<p><b>and attacked and captured it</b><br>The attack and capture of Ashdod by the Assyrian forces illustrate the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the consequences of rebellion against God's will. This event serves as a tangible example of the judgment that Isaiah often prophesied against nations that opposed God's purposes. The capture of Ashdod also foreshadows the eventual downfall of other nations that resist divine authority, reinforcing the theme of God's sovereignty over all earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sargon_king_of_assyria.htm">Sargon King of Assyria</a></b><br>Sargon II was a powerful Assyrian king known for his military campaigns and expansion of the Assyrian Empire.

Prior to that discovery, there was no trace of his name to be found elsewhere than in this passage, and his very existence had been called in question.

He succeeded Shalmaneser VI<span class= "ital">,, </span>the conqueror of Israel, in B.C. 721, at first as guardian and co-regent of his son Samdan-Malik, and afterwards in his own name. His reign lasted till B.C. 704, when he was succeeded by Sennacherib. Long inscriptions, giving the annals of his reign, were found by M. Botta at Khorsabad, and have been interpreted by M. Oppert (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 21, 9:1, 11:17, 27, 33) and others.<p><span class= "bld">And fought against Ashdod.</span>--The occasion of the campaign is related by Sargon in the annals just mentioned as happening in his eleventh year. Azuri, the king of Ashdod, refused to pay tribute, and revolted. Sargon deposed him, and placed his brother Akhismit, on the throne. The people, in their turn, rose against Akhismit, and chose Yaman as their king. Sargon then marched against the city, took it, and carried off its gods and its treasures as booty (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 40). These events naturally excited the minds of Hezekiah and his counsellors, and led them to look to an alliance with Egypt as their best protection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA. The Assyrian inscriptions enable us to date this prophecy with a near approach to exactness. Ashdod was besieged by an Assyrian army twice in the reign of Sargon - in his ninth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 713</span>) and in his eleventh year ( <span class="date">B.C. 711</span>). On the former occasion it is probable that the arms of a general (Tartan) were employed; on the latter it is nearly certain that Sargon made the expedition in person. The capture of Ashdod, here mentioned, is consequently the first capture. Egypt and Ethiopia were at the time united under one head, Shabak, or Shabatok; and the inhabitants of Ashdod looked to this quarter for deliverance from the Assyrian power. Shortly after the first capture, they revolted, deposed the king whom Sargon had set over them, appointed another, and then proceeded, in conjunction with Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, to call in the aid of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. Isaiah's mission on this occasion was to discourage Judaea from joining Ashdod and her allies in this appeal. He was instructed to prophesy that Assyria would shortly inflict a severe defeat on the two African powers, and carry into captivity large numbers of both nations. The prophecy seems to have had its accomplishment about twelve years later, when Sennacherib defeated the combined forces of Egypt and Ethiopia at Eltekeh, near Ekron (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 133). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">tartan</span>. The word was not a proper name, but a title of office, equivalent to <span class="accented">surena</span> among the Parthians, and signifying "commander-in-chief." The tartan held the second position in the empire. Isaiah has been accused of having confounded together the two sieges of Ashdod (Cheyne); but if one was conducted by the tartan, and the other by Sargon in person, his words would distinguish as perfectly as possible which siege he meant. <span class="cmt_word">When Sargon the King of Assyria sent him</span>. The present passage furnished almost the sole trace of the existence of this monarch - one of the greatest of Assyria's sovereigns - until about the middle of the present century, when the exploration of the Assyrian ruins, and the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions, presented him to us in the most distinct and vivid way, as king, conqueror, and builder. He was the founder of the last and greatest of the Assyrian dynasties, the successor of the biblical Shalmaneser, and the father of Sennacherib. He reigned from <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>. He was the captor of Samaria; he defeated the forces of Egypt; he warred on Susiana, Media, Armenia, Asia Minor, Cyprus; and he conquered and held in subjection Babylon. He built the great city explored by M. Botta, near Khorsabad, which is sometimes called "the French Nineveh." It is now found that Ptolemy's 'Canon' contains his name under the form of Arkeanus, and that Yacut's 'Geography' mentions his great city under the form of Sarghun. But these facts were unsuspected until the recent explorations in Mesopotamia, and Isaiah's mention of him alone gave him a place in history. <span class="cmt_word">And fought against Ashdod, and took it</span>. Ashdod was the strongest of the Philistine cities, and one of the most ancient (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>). Its name is probably derived from a root meaning "strength." We hear of its having stood on one occasion a siege of twenty-nine years (Herod., 2:157). It is now known as <span class="accented">Esdud</span>. When Ashdod is first mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions it is tributary to Sargon, having probably submitted to him in s c. 720, alter the battle of Raphia. It soon, however, revolts and reclaims its independence. In <span class="date">B.C. 713</span> the Assyrians proceed against it; and its capture is implied by the facts that the <span class="accented">Assyrians</span> depose its king, and install, one of his brothers as monarch in his room (comp. <a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Before the year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
