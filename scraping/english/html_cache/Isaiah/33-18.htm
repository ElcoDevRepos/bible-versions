In the context of Isaiah, it refers to the Assyrian threat that loomed over Jerusalem. Historically, the Assyrian Empire was known for its military prowess and brutality, causing terror among nations. Theologically, this can be seen as a reminder of God's deliverance from past troubles, encouraging trust in His protection. It also echoes the broader biblical theme of remembering God's past acts of salvation, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>, where the Israelites are reminded to stand firm and witness God's deliverance.<p><b>&#8220;Where is he who tallies?</b><br>This phrase refers to the officials or scribes responsible for recording and assessing the spoils of war or the tribute demanded by a conquering power. In the ancient Near East, such roles were crucial in maintaining the economic and administrative control of an empire. The rhetorical question implies the absence or irrelevance of these figures, suggesting a time when the oppressive systems of the enemy are dismantled. This can be connected to the prophetic vision of a future where God's kingdom reigns supreme, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where former things have passed away.<p><b>Where is he who weighs?</b><br>The act of weighing here likely refers to the assessment of tribute or taxes, a common practice in ancient empires to ensure control over subjugated peoples. The absence of this figure indicates liberation from oppressive economic burdens. This can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, freeing believers from the weight of sin and the law, as Paul discusses in <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1-2</a>, where there is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.<p><b>Where is he who counts the towers?&#8221;</b><br>Counting towers could refer to the military assessment of a city's defenses, a task for strategists and military leaders. The rhetorical question suggests a time when such assessments are unnecessary, pointing to a future of peace and security under God's reign. This imagery aligns with prophetic visions of peace, such as in <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3-4</a>, where nations will no longer train for war, and every person will sit under their vine and fig tree, unafraid. It also foreshadows the ultimate peace brought by Christ, the Prince of Peace, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering messages from God to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies, often facing threats from surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_threat.htm">Assyrian Threat</a></b><br>The historical context involves the Assyrian empire, which posed a significant threat to Judah during Isaiah's time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during much of Isaiah's ministry, known for his faithfulness to God and reforms in Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib's_siege.htm">Sennacherib's Siege</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who besieged Jerusalem, a backdrop to the fears and anxieties addressed in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reflect_on_past_deliverance.htm">Reflect on Past Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as the people of Judah were encouraged to remember God's deliverance from past terrors, believers today should recall how God has been faithful in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The rhetorical questions in <a href="/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a> highlight the futility of human efforts against God's plans.
