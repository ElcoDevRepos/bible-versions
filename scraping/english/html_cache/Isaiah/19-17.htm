Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, often seen as a threat to smaller nations like Judah. However, this prophecy suggests a future where Judah, though smaller and less powerful, will cause fear in Egypt. This could be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and elevate His chosen people. Theologically, it reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to use even the weak to confound the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>whenever Judah is mentioned,</b><br>The mention of Judah signifies its growing influence and the divine favor upon it. In the biblical narrative, Judah is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ descend, highlighting its messianic significance. The frequent mention of Judah in this context underscores its importance in God's redemptive plan and the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>Egypt will tremble</b><br>Egypt's trembling signifies a deep-seated fear and recognition of divine intervention. Historically, Egypt was a symbol of worldly power and idolatry, often opposing God's people. This trembling can be seen as a metaphor for the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers. It also reflects the fear of the unknown and the realization of God's judgment, as seen in other prophetic books like Ezekiel and Jeremiah.<p><b>over what the LORD of Hosts has planned against it.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority and command over heavenly armies. This phrase indicates that the events causing Egypt's fear are not random but part of a divine plan. It reassures believers of God's control over history and His ability to execute judgment and deliverance according to His will. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing God's chosen people.

The verse affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to His people, the certainty of His judgments, and His sovereign ability to humble nations so that they may ultimately acknowledge Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt</span>. In Manasseh's reign Judaea became subject to Assyria (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 139, 1. 13), and had to take part in the hostile expeditions, which both Esarhaddon and his son, Asshurbanipal, conducted against Egypt. Egypt had to keep her eye on Judaea continually, to see when danger was approaching her. If is not likely that Isaiah's prophecies caused the "terror" here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">Every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when any one maketh mention thereof</span>, <span class="accented">they shall turn to him in fear</span>. The very mention of Judaea by any one shall cause fear, because they will expect to hear that an expedition has started, or is about to start, from that country. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts.</span> This is how Isaiah views the Assyrian attacks on Egypt, not how the Egyptians viewed them. The fear felt by the Egyptians was not a religious fear. They simply dreaded the Assyrian armies, and Judaea as the country from which the expeditions seemed to issue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7695;&#183;ma&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_127.htm">Strong's 127: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ground, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bring terror</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;g&#183;g&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
