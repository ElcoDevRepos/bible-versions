The term "prophetess" suggests she may have had a role in delivering God's messages, either through her own prophetic gifts or by association with Isaiah. This union underscores the importance of family in prophetic ministry, as seen in other biblical examples like Hosea and his wife Gomer. The personal life of prophets often served as a living message to the people of Israel.<p><b>and she conceived and gave birth to a son</b><br>The conception and birth of a son are significant in the prophetic narrative. In the context of Isaiah, children often symbolize future events or divine messages. This birth is a direct fulfillment of God's word, emphasizing the reliability of prophetic declarations. The birth of a son also connects to the theme of lineage and the continuation of God's promises through generations, reminiscent of the promises made to Abraham and David.<p><b>The LORD said to me</b><br>This phrase highlights the direct communication between God and Isaiah, a hallmark of prophetic authority. It underscores the divine origin of the message and the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God. This direct revelation is a common feature in the lives of biblical prophets, such as Moses and Jeremiah, and serves to authenticate the message that follows.<p><b>Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz</b><br>The name "Maher-shalal-hash-baz" translates to "Quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil," serving as a prophetic sign of impending judgment and conquest. This name is a direct message to the people of Judah about the imminent threat from Assyria, reflecting the historical context of the Syro-Ephraimite War. The naming of children as prophetic symbols is seen elsewhere in Isaiah, such as with Immanuel, and points to the broader theme of God's sovereignty over nations and history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

What appears as an ordinary event is transformed by God into a living prophecy, affirming that He rules history, family, and nations alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I . . . the prophetess . . .</span>--The word may have been given by courtesy to a prophet's wife as such. Elsewhere, however, as in the case of Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>) and Huldah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>), it implies prophetic gifts. Possibly, therefore, we may think of the prophet and his wife as having been drawn together by united thoughts and counsels, in contrast with the celibate life of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/16-2.htm" title="You shall not take you a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters in this place.">Jeremiah 16:2</a>), the miseries of Hosea's marriage (Hosea 1, 2), and the sudden bereavement of Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/24-16.htm" title="Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.">Ezekiel 24:16-18</a>).

It is not necessary to suppose that the wife of Isaiah must have uttered prophecies because she is called "the prophetess."

In the Mishna, a priest's wife or daughter is called "priestess" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Call his name.</span> There is no reason for doubting that the name was actually given.
