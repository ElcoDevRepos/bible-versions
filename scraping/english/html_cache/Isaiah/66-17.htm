In the context of ancient Israel, consecration and purification were essential for worship and approaching God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>. However, the focus here is on those who perform these acts for idolatrous purposes, highlighting a false sense of holiness. This mirrors the hypocrisy condemned by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where outward appearances of purity mask inner corruption.<p><b>to enter the groves</b><br>Groves, or sacred gardens, were often associated with pagan worship in the ancient Near East.

The use of groves signifies a departure from the worship of Yahweh, aligning instead with Canaanite religious customs.<p><b>to follow one in the center</b><br>This phrase suggests a leader or central figure in these idolatrous practices, possibly a priest or a deity figure. The central position indicates authority and influence over the participants. This can be compared to the false prophets and leaders criticized in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>, who lead people away from true worship.<p><b>of those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats</b><br>Eating swine, vermin, and rats was strictly prohibited under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7, 29</a>-30). These animals were considered unclean, and consuming them was a direct violation of God's commandments. This behavior symbolizes a blatant disregard for God's law and a preference for pagan customs, reflecting the spiritual apostasy addressed in <a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>.<p><b>will perish together</b><br>The consequence of such idolatrous and unclean practices is destruction. This echoes the warnings throughout the Old Testament, where disobedience leads to divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>.

They wash, fast, and present themselves as ceremonially clean, yet their hearts remain unchanged. Isaiah has already warned against empty religion: &#8220;Wash and cleanse yourselves. Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>). Jesus echoed the same truth when He said, &#8220;You also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-28.htm">Matthew 23:28</a>). True consecration comes only through trusting God&#8217;s provision&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to enter the groves</b><p>These worshipers head for &#8220;the groves,&#8221; the leafy sites Israel&#8217;s neighbors used for fertility rites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>). God had forbidden His people to adopt such settings because the location itself fostered idolatry. Earlier Isaiah confronted the same practice: &#8220;You burn with lust among the oaks, under every green tree&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). Choosing the grove over God&#8217;s appointed place of worship shows deliberate rebellion, not innocent misunderstanding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to follow one in the center</b><p>They file in behind &#8220;one in the center,&#8221; most likely the officiating priest or idol at the heart of the ceremony. It pictures a parade of devotees lining up under false spiritual leadership. Scripture repeatedly warns against being swept along by a crowd headed in the wrong direction (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20-21</a>). <a href="/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a> describes similar followers who &#8220;set a table for Fortune and fill mixed bowls of wine for Destiny.&#8221; God sees the leader and every follower; none can plead ignorance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats</b><p>Eating pork, vermin, or rats directly violated the food laws given in <a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7, 29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14-8.htm">Deuteronomy 14:8</a>. The diet here is no accident; it is a conscious act tied to pagan ritual. Earlier God said, &#8220;They sit among the graves, spending the night in secret places; they eat the flesh of swine&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). Such menu choices flaunt unclean living and mock God&#8217;s holiness. In the New Testament era, dietary rules no longer bind believers the same way (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), yet the principle of separating from defilement still holds (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will perish together</b><p>Because they unite in sin, they unite in judgment. &#8220;Though hand join in hand, the wicked will not go unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>). God&#8217;s patience is long, but His justice is sure: &#8220;He will repay, bringing wrath on those who do not obey the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>). The verse makes clear that religious sincerity or cultural tradition cannot shield anyone from the consequences of deliberate idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>The final words stamp divine authority on the sentence. When the LORD speaks, His word stands (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). No earthly court can appeal His verdict, and no human opinion can dilute it. The phrase reminds us to treat every warning of Scripture as certain fact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a> paints a sobering picture: people dressing up their rebellion in religious garb, flocking to forbidden places, submitting to false leaders, indulging in practices God calls unclean&#8212;and facing shared destruction under God&#8217;s unalterable decree. The passage urges us to pursue genuine holiness rooted in obedience and faith, not external ritual or cultural fashion, because the LORD alone defines purity and pronounces destiny.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They that sanctify themselves . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">they that consecrate themselves <span class= "bld">. . .</span></span> As in <a href="/context/isaiah/65-3.htm" title="A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense on altars of brick;">Isaiah 65:3-4</a>, the prophet has in his thoughts the apostates, who gloried in mingling heathen rites with the worship of Jehovah. Such a blending of incompatible elements was, as we have seen, eminently characteristic of the reign of Manasseh. We have no trace of anything corresponding to it among the. Babylonian exiles, either before or after their return. The "consecration" and "purification" are the initiatory rites of heathen mysteries, connected probably with the worship of Baal or Ashtoreth, or, as the context, with its reference to gardens and swine's flesh, renders probable, with that of Thammuz. (See Note on <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm" title="For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.">Isaiah 64:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Behind one tree in the midst.</span>--The noun "tree" is a conjectural explanation. The Hebrew text <span class= "ital">gives </span>the "one" in the masculine, and is explained as referring either (1) to the Hierophant, who led the worshippers; or (2), as with a contemptuous reluctance to utter the name of the false deity, to Thammuz. The Hebrew margin gives "one" in the feminine, and this may have been meant for the <span class= "ital">Asherah, </span>the "grove," or Phallic symbol of idolatrous worship. If we adopt the masculine, and refer it to Thammuz, the word may connect itself with the lamentations of the Syrian maidens over Thammuz (Adonis) as over an only son. (Comp. Milton, <span class= "ital">Paradise Lost, </span>i.)<p><span class= "bld">The abomination.</span>--The word stands in <a href="/leviticus/7-21.htm" title="Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.">Leviticus 7:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-11.htm" title="They shall be even an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination.">Leviticus 11:11</a>, for various kinds of unclean beasts, among which the mouse, or jerboa, still eaten by the Arabs, was conspicuous (<a href="/leviticus/11-29.htm" title="These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,">Leviticus 11:29</a>). It is probable that all these, as well as the swine's flesh, were used in the idolfeasts. In any case the apostate worshippers would seem to have exulted in throwing off the restraints of the Mosaic law. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that sanctify... themselves</span> in the gardens (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>; and see the comment on the latter passage). Behind one tree in the midst; literally, <span class="accented">behind one in the midst.</span> It seems quite impossible that "one" can mean "one tree," when no tree has been mentioned, and gardens do not necessarily contain trees. The marginal rendering, "one after another," is also impossible. The "one in the midst" must have been either a hierophant who directed the ceremonies (Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Delitzsch), or an image of a deity (Scaliger, Voss, Grotius, Lagarde, Cheyne). In the latter case, we must suppose that the worshippers had a scruple about mentioning the deity's name, and were accustomed to call him "one," or "a certain one" (comp. Herod., 2:171).
