The "voice of His Servant" refers to the prophetic message delivered by Isaiah, and by extension, the ultimate Servant, Jesus Christ, as seen in the Servant Songs (Isaiah 42, 49, 50, 52-53). Obedience to God's Servant is a theme that resonates with the call to follow Christ in the New Testament (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), and obedience is a demonstration of genuine faith (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>Who among you walks in darkness and has no light?</b><br>This phrase addresses those experiencing spiritual desolation or confusion, a common theme in the prophetic literature where darkness symbolizes ignorance or judgment (<a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>). The absence of light suggests a lack of divine guidance or understanding. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), offering hope and direction to those in spiritual darkness. The imagery of light and darkness is prevalent throughout Scripture, contrasting the knowledge and presence of God with the absence thereof.<p><b>Let him trust in the name of the LORD;</b><br>Trusting in the name of the LORD implies reliance on God's character and promises. The "name" of the LORD encompasses His attributes, faithfulness, and covenant relationship with His people. Trust is a central theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>) and is echoed in the New Testament call to faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>). This trust is not passive but an active dependence on God's provision and protection, especially in times of uncertainty or trial.<p><b>let him lean on his God.</b><br>Leaning on God suggests a posture of dependence and surrender, akin to the imagery of a shepherd supporting his sheep (Psalm 23). This phrase encourages believers to rely on God's strength rather than their own understanding (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The concept of God as a refuge and fortress is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), providing assurance of His steadfast support. In the New Testament, this is mirrored in the call to abide in Christ (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>), emphasizing a continual, intimate reliance on God's presence and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the central figure in this passage, calling for reverence and trust.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Often interpreted as the Messiah or a prophetic figure representing God's voice and will.
