It suggests a prophetic declaration where people will recognize and confess the truth about God. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's ultimate vindication and the acknowledgment of His authority by all nations, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.<p><b>&#8216;In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes the exclusivity of God's attributes. Righteousness and strength are often associated with God's character throughout the Bible. Righteousness refers to God's moral perfection and justice, as seen in <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a>. Strength denotes His omnipotence and ability to accomplish His purposes, as reflected in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>. The phrase underscores the belief that true righteousness and strength cannot be found apart from God, echoing the monotheistic emphasis found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>.<p><b>All who rage against Him</b><br>This part of the verse addresses those who oppose or resist God. Historically, this can refer to the nations and peoples who have set themselves against God's plans and His people, Israel. The Bible often portrays such opposition as futile, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations' rage is met with divine derision. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of human rebellion against divine authority.<p><b>will come to Him</b><br>Despite their opposition, there is a prophetic assurance that these adversaries will ultimately turn to God. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where even those who resist Him will recognize His sovereignty. This theme is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, where all nations will stream to the mountain of the Lord, seeking His ways and instruction.<p><b>and be put to shame.</b><br>The concept of shame here is tied to the realization of one's error in opposing God. Biblically, shame often accompanies the exposure of sin and the acknowledgment of God's truth, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>. This phrase suggests a reversal of fortunes, where those who once boasted in their strength and defiance will be humbled before God's righteousness and power. This aligns with the biblical principle that pride leads to downfall, as stated in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the God of Israel, who is the source of righteousness and strength.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel, including this declaration of God's sovereignty and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Isaiah prophesied, often struggling with idolatry and turning away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_rage_against_him.htm">Those who rage against Him</a></b><br>Refers to individuals or nations opposing God, who will ultimately recognize His authority and be put to shame.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_babylonian_captivity.htm">The context of Babylonian captivity</a></b><br>Isaiah's prophecies often address the period of Babylonian captivity, a time of judgment and eventual restoration for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_exclusive_righteousness_and_strength.htm">God's Exclusive Righteousness and Strength</a></b><br>Recognize that true righteousness and strength are found only in the LORD.
