Warfare and exile were common methods of divine discipline in the Old Testament, as seen in the Babylonian captivity (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>). The exile served as a means to purify and restore the people to a right relationship with God. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and restoration through Christ, who brings spiritual freedom from sin.<p><b>You contended with her</b><br>God's contention with Israel is a recurring theme, highlighting His role as both judge and redeemer. This contention is not out of malice but out of a desire for Israel to return to Him. The prophets often spoke of God's grievances with Israel (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), emphasizing His righteousness and justice. This contention points to the need for repentance and the hope of reconciliation through the Messiah.<p><b>and removed her with a fierce wind</b><br>The imagery of a fierce wind signifies God's powerful and decisive action. In the ancient Near East, winds were often seen as instruments of divine intervention. This phrase can be connected to the idea of God using natural elements to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). The fierce wind symbolizes the severity of God's judgment but also His control over creation.<p><b>as on the day the east wind blows</b><br>The east wind in biblical literature often represents destruction and desolation (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>). It is a hot, dry wind that can devastate crops and landscapes, symbolizing the harshness of God's judgment. This phrase underscores the seriousness of Israel's situation and the need for divine intervention. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the ultimate hope of restoration through His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who is actively involved in the judgment and restoration of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation being addressed, often symbolized as a vineyard in Isaiah, undergoing discipline and eventual restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_wind.htm">East Wind</a></b><br>A metaphorical representation of God's judgment, often associated with harshness and destruction in the Bible.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/warfare_and_exile.htm">Warfare and Exile</a></b><br>The means by which God disciplines His people, leading to their purification and eventual return.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, providing insight into God's plans for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_discipline.htm">God's Sovereignty in Discipline</a></b><br>God uses various means, including difficult circumstances, to discipline and refine His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_divine_judgment.htm">Purpose of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The ultimate goal of God's judgment is not destruction but purification and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_east_wind.htm">Symbolism of the East Wind</a></b><br>Understanding biblical metaphors like the east wind can deepen our comprehension of God's actions and intentions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>Even in the midst of judgment, God promises eventual restoration and renewal for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_discipline.htm">Responding to God's Discipline</a></b><br>Believers are called to respond to God's discipline with repentance and faith, trusting in His ultimate plan for good.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_27_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 27:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_27_8_God_s_discipline_mercy.htm">How does Isaiah 27:8 illustrate God's discipline and mercy towards His people?

Comp. for this meaning <a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm" title="The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-16.htm" title="For the LORD, the God of Israel, said that he hates putting away: for one covers violence with his garment, said the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that you deal not treacherously.">Malachi 2:16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He stayeth his rough wind . . .</span>--The words have become familiar, as expressing the loving-kindness which will not heap chastisement on chastisement, lest a man should be swallowed up of overmuch sorrow, which keeps the "rough wind" from completing the devastation already wrought by the scorching "east wind." That rendering, however, can scarcely be maintained. The word translated "stay" is found elsewhere in <a href="/context/proverbs/25-4.htm" title="Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.">Proverbs 25:4-5</a>, and there has the sense of "separating," or "sifting." And this is its sense here also, the thought expressed asserting, though in another form than the traditional rendering, the compassion of Jehovah, in that He <span class= "ital">sifts with his rough wind in the day of east wind; </span>though punishment come on punishment, it is reformatory, and not simply penal, to <span class= "ital">sift, </span>and not to destroy. A rendering accepted by some critics gives, <span class= "ital">He sigheth with His rough wind, </span>as though with a sorrowing pity mingled with the chastisement. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Our translators have entirely mistaken the meaning of this verse.

"In measure" means "with forbearance and moderation" - the punishment being carefully adjusted to the degree of the offence.
