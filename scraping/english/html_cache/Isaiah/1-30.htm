However, in this context, it represents something that was once strong but is now deteriorating. The oak's decline symbolizes the spiritual and moral decay of the people of Judah. This imagery is used to convey the consequences of turning away from God. The oak's strength is compromised, reflecting the nation's weakened state due to sin and rebellion.<p><b>whose leaves are withered</b><br>Withered leaves indicate a lack of life and vitality. In the biblical context, leaves often symbolize prosperity and blessing (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). The withering of the leaves suggests a loss of divine favor and the resulting spiritual barrenness. This imagery serves as a warning of the consequences of forsaking God's commandments and the resulting judgment. It also reflects the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness and the resulting desolation.<p><b>like a garden without water</b><br>A garden without water is a powerful image of desolation and neglect. Water is essential for life and growth, symbolizing the sustenance that comes from God. In the arid climate of the Near East, water is a precious resource, and its absence leads to barrenness. This phrase underscores the spiritual drought experienced by the people due to their disobedience. It echoes other biblical passages where water represents the Holy Spirit and God's provision (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>). The lack of water signifies the absence of God's presence and blessing, leading to spiritual desolation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
