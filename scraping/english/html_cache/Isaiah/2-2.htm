It is a common biblical term used to describe the culmination of God's plan for history. Other scriptures, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> and <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>, also use this term to describe a time of divine intervention and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>the mountain of the house of the LORD</b><br>This refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. In biblical symbolism, mountains often represent places of divine revelation and presence. The "house of the LORD" signifies the temple, a central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/micah/4.htm">Micah 4:1-2</a>, which shares a similar prophecy.<p><b>will be established as the chief of the mountains</b><br>This indicates a position of preeminence and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, mountains were seen as sacred and powerful. The prophecy suggests that God's kingdom, represented by the temple mount, will be exalted above all other religious and political systems. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom on earth.<p><b>it will be raised above the hills</b><br>This emphasizes the supremacy and exaltation of God's kingdom. The raising above the hills signifies a divine elevation, not necessarily a physical one, indicating the spiritual authority and prominence of God's rule. This can be connected to <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>, where Christ is exalted above all.<p><b>and all nations will stream to it</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of God's salvation plan. It envisions a time when people from all nations will seek the God of Israel, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).

Whether (1) Isaiah borrowed from Micah, or (2) Micah from Isaiah, or (3) both from some earlier prophet, or (4) whether each received an independent yet identical revelation, is a problem which we have no adequate data for solving. Micah prophesied, like Isaiah, under Ahaz, Jotham, and Hezekiah, and so either may have heard it from the other. On the other hand, the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, on which these verses follow, in <a href="/micah/3-12.htm" title="Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.">Micah 3:12</a>, appears from <a href="/jeremiah/26-18.htm" title="Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.">Jeremiah 26:18</a> to have been spoken in the days of Hezekiah.

Spiritually, it would be a "mountain," as "a city set on a hill," which "could not be hid" (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>); and again, as occupying a position from which it would command the whole earth. <span class="cmt_word">In the top of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">at the head of the mountains</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with pre-eminence over them. The metaphor is drawn from the common physical fact of a high mountain range culminating in a single supreme eminence. So Mount Hermon towers above the rest of the Antilibanus, Demavend over Elburz, Rowandiz over Zagros. The "mountains" above which the true Zion shall tower are the kingdoms, or perhaps the religions, of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">All nations</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the nations of the earth" (comp. <a href="/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall flow</span>; or, <span class="accented">stream</span>. A constant accession of converts from all quarters is intended. These are represented as continually streaming upward into the holy mountain of God's house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the last</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
