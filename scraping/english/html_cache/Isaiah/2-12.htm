It is often associated with both immediate historical events and eschatological fulfillment. The term "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the armies of heaven, underscoring His power to execute judgment. This phrase connects to other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-11</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, which also describe the Day of the LORD as a time of darkness and judgment.<p><b>will come against all the proud and lofty</b><br>Pride is consistently condemned throughout Scripture as a sin that leads to downfall. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The proud and lofty are those who elevate themselves above others and, by extension, above God. This phrase reflects the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). Historically, this could refer to the nations surrounding Israel that exalted themselves, such as Babylon and Assyria, which were eventually brought low.<p><b>against all that is exalted&#8212;it will be humbled&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty of God's judgment. Anything or anyone that is exalted in defiance of God will be brought low. This is a theme seen throughout the Bible, where God humbles those who are arrogant, as seen in the story of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>. The humbling of the exalted is also a type of Christ's teaching in the New Testament, where He often spoke of the first being last and the last being first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). This reversal of fortunes is a key aspect of God's justice and the establishment of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
