In the biblical context, it highlights God's ability to know and determine the course of history from its inception to its conclusion. This is a unique attribute of God, distinguishing Him from idols and false gods, which are powerless and lack foresight. The declaration of the end from the beginning is a testament to God's eternal nature, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, where He is described as the Alpha and Omega. This also connects to the prophetic nature of Scripture, where God reveals His plans and purposes through His prophets, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>and from ancient times what is still to come</b><br>This phrase underscores God's timelessness and His control over future events. The reference to "ancient times" suggests that God's plans have been established long before human history unfolded. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's eternal covenant and promises, such as those made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, which have implications for future generations. The phrase also points to the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in the coming of Christ, who was foretold in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>) and fulfilled in the New Testament.<p><b>I say, &#8216;My purpose will stand</b><br>Here, God's purpose is depicted as unchangeable and steadfast. This reflects the biblical truth that God's will is sovereign and cannot be thwarted by human actions or circumstances. In the historical context, this assurance was given to the Israelites during their captivity, reminding them of God's ultimate plan for their redemption and restoration. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where Paul speaks of God's purpose working for the good of those who love Him. The phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection were part of God's eternal purpose.<p><b>and all My good pleasure I will accomplish.&#8217;</b><br>This final phrase highlights God's active role in bringing His plans to fruition. The term "good pleasure" indicates that God's actions are not arbitrary but are rooted in His benevolent and righteous character. This is seen throughout Scripture, where God's actions are aligned with His nature, as in <a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>, which states that God does whatever pleases Him. The fulfillment of God's good pleasure is ultimately realized in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who accomplished God's plan of salvation, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>. This assurance of God's accomplishment provides hope and confidence to believers, knowing that God's purposes will prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

Isaiah prophesies about the fall of Babylon and the deliverance of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus.htm">Cyrus</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, Cyrus the Great is a key figure in the surrounding chapters.

From <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the Lord foretells the ultimate defeat of the serpent, to <a href="/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>, where He affirms, &#8220;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&#8221; Scripture is filled with the Lord&#8217;s advance declarations. <a href="/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a> reminds us, &#8220;Says the Lord, who makes these things known from long ago&#8221;.
