The grinding of grain is a metaphor for the trials and refining processes that believers undergo. In biblical times, grain was ground using millstones, a labor-intensive process that required patience and skill. This imagery can be connected to the refining process described in other scriptures, such as <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>, where God is depicted as a refiner and purifier. The necessity of grinding also points to the idea that trials and challenges are essential for spiritual growth and maturity.<p><b>but it is not endlessly threshed</b><br>Threshing was a common agricultural practice in ancient Israel, involving the separation of grain from the chaff. This phrase suggests that while discipline and refinement are necessary, they are not meant to be excessive or unending. God's discipline is purposeful and measured, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a>, where it is described as producing a harvest of righteousness and peace. The restraint in threshing reflects God's mercy and understanding of human limitations, ensuring that His people are not overwhelmed.<p><b>Though the wheels of the cart roll over it</b><br>The imagery of cart wheels rolling over grain further emphasizes the process of refinement and pressure. In ancient times, carts were used to transport heavy loads, and their wheels could crush anything in their path. This phrase suggests that while believers may face significant pressure and challenges, these are part of God's refining process. The rolling wheels can be seen as a metaphor for life's trials, which, although heavy, are controlled by God to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<p><b>the horses do not crush it</b><br>Horses, often associated with strength and power, symbolize the potential for overwhelming force. However, this phrase reassures that despite the presence of powerful forces, the grain is not crushed. This reflects God's protection and care for His people, ensuring that they are not destroyed by the trials they face. It echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, which promises that God will not allow believers to be tested beyond their ability to endure. The restraint shown by the horses underscores God's sovereignty and the assurance that He will preserve His people through their trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

For this a severer chastisement, a more thorough threshing, was needed; but the end of threshing is the preservation, not the destruction, of the true grain. It is for a time, not for ever. It separates the worthless from the precious. The wheels stop when they have done their work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bread corn is braised</span>; literally, <span class="accented">bread</span>; but no doubt the corn, from which bread is made, is meant. Most critics regard the clause as interrogative, "Is bread corn bruised?" - and the answer as given in the negative by the rest of the sentence, "No; he will not continue always threshing it, nor crunch it with his cart-wheel and his horses - he will not bruise it." Even where the rougher modes of threshing are employed, there is moderation in their employment. Care is taken not to injure the grain. Here the main bearing of the whole parable appears. The afflictions which God sends upon his people are adapted to their strength and to their needs. In no case are they such as to crush and injure. Only such violence is used as is required to detach the good seed from the husks. Where the process is most severe, still the "bread-corn" is not "bruised." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/28-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Grain for bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1443;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">must be ground,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1854.htm">Strong's 1854: </a> </span><span class="str2">To crush, pulverize, thresh</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">endlessly threshed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;&#183;&#353;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
