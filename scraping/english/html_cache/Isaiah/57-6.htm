The "smooth stones" may refer to stones used in pagan rituals, possibly linked to the worship of deities like Baal or Asherah. These stones were often considered sacred and were used as altars or idols. The Israelites were warned against adopting such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>). The use of "portion" suggests a chosen inheritance or destiny, indicating that the people have chosen idolatry over their covenant with God.<p><b>indeed, they are your lot.</b><br>The term "lot" implies a divinely assigned inheritance, often used in the context of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>). Here, it is used ironically to indicate that the people have chosen a fate tied to idolatry rather than the blessings of God. This choice reflects a spiritual adultery, as they have forsaken their divine inheritance for pagan practices.<p><b>Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering.</b><br>Drink and grain offerings were part of the sacrificial system ordained by God (<a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>). However, offering them to idols was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase highlights the syncretism and apostasy of the people, as they have taken elements of true worship and corrupted them by offering them to false gods. This act of idolatry is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where God condemns the mixing of pagan practices with His worship (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>).<p><b>Should I relent because of these?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores God's justice and the seriousness of idolatry. It implies that God cannot overlook such blatant disobedience and betrayal. The question challenges the people to consider the gravity of their actions and the inevitable consequences. It echoes the warnings given by other prophets, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, where God calls for repentance to avoid judgment. The question also reflects God's character as both just and merciful, emphasizing that while He desires repentance, He cannot ignore unrepentant sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The phrase exposes a tragic trade-off: they have abandoned &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s portion&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>) for lifeless rocks.<p>&#8226; Valleys were common sites for Canaanite fertility rites and child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). By settling their identity there, Judah aligns with the idols of the land rather than the covenant promises given on higher ground (<a href="/exodus/19-3.htm">Exodus 19:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is deliberate&#8212;while Joshua set up memorial stones in the Jordan to remember God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>), these smooth stones celebrate rebellion. Jeremiah makes the same indictment: &#8220;They have polluted My land with the carcasses of their detestable idols&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, whatever we prize most becomes our &#8220;portion.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a> affirms, &#8220;The LORD is my chosen portion&#8221; (cf. <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>); Isaiah shows the emptiness of any rival claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even to them you have poured out a drink offering and offered a grain offering.</b><p>&#8226; Offerings that belonged exclusively to God (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>) are here diverted to idols.

Sin rarely remains passive; it demands ongoing tribute (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The worship resembles the true but lacks the object of truth. Paul later warns of the same danger&#8212;&#8220;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Should I relent because of these?</b><p>&#8226; God poses a rhetorical question: Will ritualistic idolatry persuade Him to withhold judgment?
