"Jacob" here refers to the patriarch whose name was changed to Israel, symbolizing the entire nation. The use of "Jacob" emphasizes the covenant relationship and the historical roots of the people. This message is a warning or judgment, reflecting the prophetic tradition where God communicates His displeasure with the people's actions. The prophets, like Isaiah, served as intermediaries, conveying God's words to the people. This aligns with other instances in the Old Testament where God sends messages through prophets, such as in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where it is stated that God reveals His plans to His servants, the prophets.<p><b>and it has fallen upon Israel</b><br>The phrase "fallen upon Israel" suggests the inevitability and weight of the message, indicating that it is not just spoken but has tangible consequences. "Israel" here refers to the northern kingdom, which was often in conflict with God's commands, leading to their eventual downfall. This reflects the historical context of the divided kingdom after Solomon's reign, where Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) often faced different fates. The message's impact is both immediate and prophetic, foreshadowing the Assyrian invasion and the subsequent exile of the northern tribes. This serves as a reminder of the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of turning away from God and the certainty of His judgments, which are themes echoed throughout the prophetic books.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgment through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used interchangeably with Israel in prophetic literature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, distinct from Judah, often characterized by its rebellion against God during the time of the prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/message.htm">Message</a></b><br>A divine pronouncement or oracle, often of judgment, delivered by God through His prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The messenger through whom God delivers His message, a major prophet in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and His judgments are just.

The vision of the glory of the far-off king comes to an end, and the prophet returns to the more immediate surroundings of his time. The "word" which Jehovah sends is the prophetic message that follows. It is a question whether the terms "Jacob" and "Israel" stand in the parallelism of identity or contrast, but the use of the former term in <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/2-5.htm" title="O house of Jacob, come you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.">Isaiah 2:5-6</a>, makes the former use more probable. In this case both names stand practically for the kingdom of Judah as the true representative of Israel, the apostate kingdom of the Ten Tribes being no longer worthy of the name, and therefore described here, as in <a href="/isaiah/7-5.htm" title="Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against you, saying,">Isaiah 7:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-8.htm" title="For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.">Isaiah 7:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm" title="The LORD shall bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.">Isaiah 7:17</a>, simply as Ephraim. The occasion of the prophecy is given in <a href="/isaiah/9-9.htm" title="And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,">Isaiah 9:9</a>. Pekah, the king of Ephraim, was still confident in his strength, and in spite of his partial failure, and the defeat of his ally (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>), derided the prophet's prediction. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-21.</span> - THE PROPHET RETURNS TO THREATS AND WARNINGS, ADDRESSED CHIEFLY TO THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL. The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: "For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still." A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, "some period in the reign of Jotham" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. "Jacob" designates Judah rather than Israel in <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6</a>; and the expression, "both the houses of Israel," in <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, shows that the term "Israel" embraces both kingdoms. Tim distinctive names by which Isaiah ordinarily designates the northern kingdom are "Ephraim" and "Samaria." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a message</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1435;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against Jacob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and it has fallen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;p&#772;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">upon Israel.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 9:8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 9:7"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 9:7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/9-9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 9:9"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 9:9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
