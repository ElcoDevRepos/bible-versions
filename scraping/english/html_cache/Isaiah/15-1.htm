The oracle reminds us that the LORD rules over every nation, not just Israel (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>- The certainty of divine judgment underscores His holiness (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>) and His faithfulness to earlier warnings issued through Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!</b><p>- Ar was a principal city in Moab (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>). Its sudden fall &#8220;in a night&#8221; highlights the swiftness of God&#8217;s hand&#8212;no human defense can stand when He decrees judgment (<a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-6</a>).<p>- Moab&#8217;s pride and idolatry had long invited divine discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/48-29.htm">Jeremiah 48:29</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>). God&#8217;s patience has limits; when the moment arrives, destruction can be immediate (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>).<p>- The prophecy fulfills earlier hints that fire would come out of Heshbon and consume &#8220;Ar of Moab&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>), showing Scripture&#8217;s internal consistency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!</b><p>- Kir (also called Kir-hareseth) was Moab&#8217;s fortified stronghold (<a href="/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>). If even the fortified city collapses overnight, the entire nation is defenseless (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>- <a href="/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a> echoes this scene: &#8220;I will send fire upon Moab, and it will consume the citadels of Kerioth&#8221;.

The verse calls readers to take God&#8217;s word seriously, reject pride, and trust the LORD who controls the destiny of every nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">The burden of Moab.</span>--The oracle which fills the next two chapters deals with the coming history of Moab. The comparative obscurity of that history, the names of towns and villages which it is difficult to identify, present a striking contrast to the evolution of the great world-drama which is brought before us in the "burden" of Babylon. What light can be thrown on that obscurity must be gathered from what we can learn of the contemporary history of Moab and its relation to Israel. This we know partly from the record of 2 Kings 3, partly from the inscription of the Moabite stone found at Diban, in 1860, by Mr. Klein, and translated by Dr. Ginsburg in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>xi. 163. Combining the information from these two sources, we find that Omri and Ahab had subdued Moab when that nation was governed by Chemosh-Gad of Dibon, and had compelled him to pay a sheep tribute reckoned by hundreds of thousands. When Jehoram succeeded Ahab, Mesha, the son of Chemosh-Gad, revolted, and the Moabite inscription records the successful issue of the campaign. Jehoram entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom. The Moabites were defeated. Their trees were cut down, their wells stopped, and their land made barren. The king of Moab in his despair offered up his son as a sacrifice to Chemosh in the sight of both armies. With that sacrifice apparently the tide of victory turned. Mesha, in his inscription, records how he took Nebo from Israel and slew seven thousand men, and built or restored fortified towns, and offered the vessels of Jehovah, taken probably from the sanctuaries of the "high places" of Nebo. Exulting in the memory of this victory, Moab became "exceeding proud" (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm" title="We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.">Isaiah 16:6</a>), and in a psalm, probably contemporary with Isaiah (see the mention of Assur, or Assyria, in <a href="/psalms/83-8.htm" title="Assur also is joined with them: they have helped the children of Lot. Selah.">Psalm 83:8</a>), they are named as among the enemies of Judah, joined with the Philistines and Assyrians. It is probable enough that, having been kept in check-by the prosperous rule of Uzziah, they took advantage of the weakness of Ahaz to renew hostilities, and were looking, half with dread, half with hope, to the Assyrian power. It may be noted here that the following cities named in these chapters--Dibon, Medeba, Nebo, Horonaim--occur also in the Moabite stone, which thus renders a striking testimony to their antiquity, and, so far, to their authenticity. (Comp. Jeremiah 48, which is, to a large extent, a reproduction of Isaiah's language.)<p><span class= "bld">Ar of Moab is laid waste.</span>--This was apparently the older capital (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>), sometimes known as Rabbath Moab. In Jerome's time it was known as Areopolis, the Greeks catching, probably, at the resemblance between the name Ar and that of their god, Ares. Probably Ar was a Moabite form of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">Ir, </span>a city. One of the names survives in the modern <span class= "ital">Rabba; </span>but the ruins are comparatively insignificant. The prophet begins with words of threatening. Both that city and Kir (here again the word means "city," and if we identify it, as most experts do, with <span class= "ital">Kerek, </span>the castle on a hill, which rises to 1,000 feet above the Dead Sea, it must have been the strongest of the Moabite fortresses) were to be attacked at night, when resistance was most hopeless. So Mesha boasts (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, xi.</span> 66) that he had taken Nebo by a night attack. We note the emphasis of iteration in the words "laid waste and brought to silence." The latter clause would be more accurately rendered <span class= "ital">cut off, </span>or <span class= "ital">destroyed.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - THE BURDEN OF MOAB. The present chapter and the next are very closely connected, and may be regarded as together constituting "the burden of Moab." It has been argued on critical grounds that the bulk of the prophecy is quoted by Isaiah from an earlier writer, and that he has merely modified the wording and added a few touches here and there (so Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Maurer, Ewald, Knobel, and Cheyne). Jeremiah is thought to have also based his "judgment of Moab" (<a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.) on the same early writing. But speculations of this kind are in the highest degree uncertain, and moreover lead to no results of the slightest importance. It is best, therefore, to regard Isaiah as the author of these two chapters. Having threatened Philistia, Israel's nearest enemy upon the west, he turns to Moab, her nearest foe towards the east. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. An elliptical beginning. Mr. Cheyne supposes some such words as "Lament for Moab," or "Alas for Moab!" to have been in the writer's mind, but to have been omitted through "lyrical excitement." <span class="cmt_word">In the night</span>. This is best taken literally. Night attacks, though not common in antiquity, were not unknown. Mesha, King of Moab, boasts that he "went in the night" against Nebo, and assaulted it at early dawn (Moabite Stone, I. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Ar of Moab</span>; or, <span class="accented">Ar-Moab</span>. An ancient city, mentioned among those taken from the Moabites by Sihon (<a href="/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>). According to Jerome, it was called in Roman times Areopolis, or Rabbath-Moab. Modern geographers identify it with <span class="accented">Rabba</span>, a place on the old Roman road between <span class="accented">Kerak</span> and <span class="accented">Arair</span>, south of the Amen, where there are some ancient remains, though they are not very extensive (Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 377). <span class="cmt_word">Is laid waste, and brought to silence</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is stormed</span>, <span class="accented">is ruined</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kir of Moab</span>. "Kir of Moab" is reasonably identified with <span class="accented">Kerak</span>, a place very strongly situated on a mountain peak, about ten miles flora the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/15-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[This is] an oracle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4853.htm">Strong's 4853: </a> </span><span class="str2">A burden, tribute, porterage, an utterance, chiefly a, doom, singing, mental, desire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">concerning Moab:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6144.htm">Strong's 6144: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ar -- a place in Moab</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is ruined,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ud&#183;da&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7703.htm">Strong's 7703: </a> </span><span class="str2">To deal violently with, despoil, devastate, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">destroyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#7695;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1820.htm">Strong's 1820: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be dumb, silent, to fail, perish, trans, to destroy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in a night!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1438;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
