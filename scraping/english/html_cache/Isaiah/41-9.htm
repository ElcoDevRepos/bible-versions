Historically, it refers to the Israelites' return from exile, symbolizing God's ability to reach and redeem His people regardless of their location. The "ends of the earth" signifies the vastness of God's reach and His authority over all nations. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the global spread of the Gospel, where God calls people from every nation to Himself.<p><b>and called you from its farthest corners.</b><br>The calling from the "farthest corners" highlights God's intimate knowledge and personal relationship with His people. It suggests that no matter how distant or scattered they are, God knows them and calls them by name. This reflects the biblical theme of God's omnipresence and His ability to gather His chosen ones. It also connects to the New Testament idea of the Church being called from all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>I said, &#8216;You are My servant.&#8217;</b><br>This declaration establishes a covenant relationship between God and His people. The term "servant" is significant in Isaiah, often referring to Israel as a nation and prophetically pointing to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, as the ultimate Servant of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). This role involves both privilege and responsibility, as God's people are called to serve His purposes in the world.<p><b>I have chosen and not rejected you.</b><br>God's choice of Israel is rooted in His covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This assurance of being chosen and not rejected provides comfort and security, especially in times of trial or exile. It underscores the theme of divine election and grace, where God's choice is based on His love and purpose rather than human merit. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as chosen by God (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>), reinforcing the continuity of God's redemptive plan through history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
