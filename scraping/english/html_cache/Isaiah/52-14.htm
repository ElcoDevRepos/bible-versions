The word "appalled" suggests a strong emotional response of shock or horror. This reaction is consistent with the New Testament accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, where many were astonished at the suffering He endured (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). The prophecy here foreshadows the rejection and misunderstanding of the Messiah's mission, as seen in <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>, where He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.<p><b>His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man,</b><br>This phrase highlights the extent of the physical suffering and abuse that the Servant would endure. The disfigurement suggests severe physical trauma, which aligns with the accounts of Jesus' scourging and crucifixion (<a href="/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15-20</a>). The Roman practice of scourging was brutal, often leaving the victim severely wounded and disfigured. This prophecy underscores the depth of Christ's suffering for humanity's sins, as further elaborated in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where it states, "He was pierced for our transgressions."<p><b>and His form was marred beyond human likeness&#8212;</b><br>The description of being "marred beyond human likeness" emphasizes the extreme nature of the Servant's suffering, to the point where He was scarcely recognizable. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the suffering servant motif, where the Messiah would bear the sins and iniquities of many (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>). Theologically, this points to the substitutionary atonement of Christ, who took on the punishment deserved by humanity. The marred form also serves as a type of Christ's humility and willingness to endure such suffering, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where He "made Himself nothing" and "humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death&#8212;even death on a cross."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Christians traditionally interpret as referring to Jesus Christ.

It has to be noted, however, that the earlier forms of that art, prior to the time of Constantine, and, in some cases, later, represented the Christ as worn, emaciated, with hardly any touch of earthly comeliness, and that it is at least possible that the beauty may have been of expression rather than of feature or complexion, and that men have said of Him, as of St. Paul, that his "bodily presence was weak" (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2Corinthians 10:10</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As many were astonied at thee.</span> The world was "astonied" to see, in One come to deliver it, no outward show of grandeur or magnificence, no special beauty or "comeliness" (<a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>), but a Presence unattractive to the mass of men at all times, and in the end so cruelly marred and disfigured as to retain scarcely any resemblance to the ordinary form and face of man.
