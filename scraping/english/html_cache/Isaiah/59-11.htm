The imagery of bears growling suggests a sense of anger and restlessness, while the moaning of doves conveys sorrow and lamentation. In the biblical context, bears are often associated with ferocity and strength (<a href="/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>), while doves symbolize peace and innocence (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>). The juxtaposition of these animals highlights the internal conflict and despair of the Israelites. Historically, this period was marked by social injustice and spiritual decline, leading to a collective cry for deliverance. The use of animal imagery is common in prophetic literature to convey emotional states and societal conditions.<p><b>We hope for justice, but find none,</b><br>The longing for justice reflects the Israelites' desire for righteousness and fairness, which were absent in their society. Justice is a central theme in the Old Testament, often linked to God's character and His expectations for His people (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The absence of justice indicates a failure to uphold the covenantal laws given to Israel. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative where God's people repeatedly fall short of His standards, leading to periods of judgment and exile. The prophetic call for justice is a reminder of the moral and ethical responsibilities of God's people.<p><b>for salvation, but it is far from us.</b><br>Salvation here refers to deliverance from both physical and spiritual oppression. The distance of salvation signifies the people's separation from God due to their sins. In the Old Testament, salvation is often depicted as God's intervention in history to rescue His people (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>). The lament of its absence underscores the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the need for repentance. This longing for salvation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the prophetic hope for redemption and reconciliation with God (<a href="/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-79</a>). The phrase serves as a poignant reminder of the human condition and the need for divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Both flow from the same root problem&#8212;alienation from God.<p>&#8226; The dove&#8217;s plaintive coo underscores helplessness; the people sense that no human scheme will rescue them (<a href="/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We hope for justice</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Justice&#8221; (mishpat) in Isaiah is the right ordering of life under God&#8217;s law (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Even a rebellious nation still longs for things to be set right. Conscience testifies that God&#8217;s design is good (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Hope itself is not wrong; Scripture commends it (<a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5</a>). The tragedy here is misplaced confidence&#8212;expecting justice while refusing the Just One.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but find none</b><p>&#8226; Their search is futile because sin blocks the pathway (<a href="/isaiah/59-9.htm">Isaiah 59:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; God has not failed; rather, iniquity has erected a barrier (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The discovery that &#8220;none&#8221; exists leads to despair, yet it also prepares the heart for divine intervention (<a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for salvation</b><p>&#8226; The word points to deliverance in every sense&#8212;spiritual, social, political (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a>).<p>&#8226; They know only God can save; history had shown this from the exodus onward (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their cry anticipates the later revelation that the Messiah Himself would embody salvation (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="/luke/2-30.htm">Luke 2:30&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but it is far from us</b><p>&#8226; Distance language highlights separation: God is near the humble but far from the unrepentant (<a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The people admit the gap; confession begins to surface (<a href="/isaiah/59-12.htm">Isaiah 59:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Although salvation feels remote, God promises to draw near, culminating in the Redeemer who comes to Zion (<a href="/isaiah/59-20.htm">Isaiah 59:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse paints a vivid portrait of a society crushed by its own rebellion: roaring in anger, sighing in grief, yearning for justice and rescue, yet finding nothing because sin has pushed salvation out of reach.
