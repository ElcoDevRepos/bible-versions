Historically, Israel was often isolated, surrounded by hostile nations. This prophecy points to a time of expansion and influence beyond traditional boundaries. It foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p><b>and nations who do not know you will run to you</b><br>This indicates a reversal of roles where foreign nations, once indifferent or hostile, will seek out Israel. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the Abrahamic promise that through Israel all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also prefigures the global spread of the Gospel, where people from all nations are drawn to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>For the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The title "Holy One of Israel" underscores God's unique and set-apart nature, as well as His faithfulness to His people. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate source of Israel's future glory and influence. This title is frequently used in Isaiah to highlight God's distinctiveness and His commitment to His covenant promises.<p><b>has bestowed glory on you</b><br>The bestowal of glory signifies a transformation and elevation of Israel's status among the nations. This glory is not due to Israel's own merit but is a gift from God, reflecting His grace and purpose. It points to a future messianic age when Israel will be a light to the nations, fulfilled in the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's glory (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).
