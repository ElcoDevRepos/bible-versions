The imagery of God "coming out of His dwelling" suggests a divine visitation, reminiscent of the theophanies in the Old Testament where God manifests His presence. This can be connected to passages like <a href="/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11</a>, where God descends on Mount Sinai. It underscores God's transcendence and immanence, highlighting His role as both the Creator and Judge. Theologically, it points to the eschatological expectation of God's ultimate intervention in history.<p><b>to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the theme of divine justice. The "inhabitants of the earth" refers to humanity at large, emphasizing the universal scope of God's judgment. The term "iniquity" denotes moral corruption and sin, aligning with the biblical understanding of sin as rebellion against God's law. This connects to <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness. The punishment is not arbitrary but a response to human sinfulness, reflecting God's holiness and righteousness.<p><b>The earth will reveal her bloodshed</b><br>Here, the earth is personified, suggesting that creation itself bears witness to human sin. This echoes <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, where Abel's blood cries out from the ground, indicating that injustice and violence cannot be hidden from God. The imagery implies that the earth, often seen as a silent witness, will testify against the wickedness of humanity. It highlights the biblical theme of creation groaning under the weight of sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>.<p><b>and will no longer conceal her slain.</b><br>This phrase indicates a time of reckoning when hidden sins are exposed. The idea of the earth no longer concealing the slain suggests that divine justice will bring to light all acts of violence and murder. It aligns with the prophetic theme of truth being revealed, as seen in <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>, where Jesus states that nothing concealed will not be disclosed. This serves as a warning of the inevitable exposure of sin and the certainty of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's divine authority and justice.

Bloodshed "cries to God for vengeance" (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>), and will be one of the main causes of the world's final destruction (<a href="/revelation/16-6.htm">Revelation 16:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-20.htm">Revelation 18:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And shall no more cover her slain</span>.
