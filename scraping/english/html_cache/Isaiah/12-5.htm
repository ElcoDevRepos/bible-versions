Singing to the LORD is an expression of joy and gratitude, often seen in the context of deliverance and salvation. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, music and singing were integral parts of religious ceremonies and celebrations. This call to sing is not just a personal act but a communal one, inviting the people of God to join together in worship.<p><b>for He has done glorious things</b><br>The "glorious things" refer to the mighty acts of God, particularly His deliverance and salvation of His people. In the context of Isaiah, this can be seen as a reference to the deliverance from Assyrian oppression and a future hope of ultimate salvation through the Messiah. The phrase echoes the song of Moses in <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, where the Israelites praised God for their deliverance from Egypt. It also points forward to the ultimate act of salvation through Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection are the most glorious acts of God.<p><b>Let this be known in all the earth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of God's salvation and the call to proclaim His deeds to all nations. It reflects the missional aspect of Israel's calling to be a light to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The proclamation of God's works is not limited to Israel but is intended for all the earth, foreshadowing the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.
