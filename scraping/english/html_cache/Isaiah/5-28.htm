In ancient warfare, sharpened arrows were essential for effective combat, symbolizing preparedness and the ability to strike with accuracy. The imagery of sharpened arrows can be connected to other biblical passages that speak of God's judgment or the readiness of His people, such as <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, where God prepares His instruments of judgment. The sharpening of arrows also reflects the meticulous preparation of the invading forces, emphasizing the imminent threat they pose.<p><b>and all their bows are strung</b><br>The strung bows signify that the army is fully prepared for immediate action. In the ancient Near East, bows were a primary weapon of war, and having them strung meant the soldiers were ready to engage at a moment's notice. This readiness can be seen as a metaphor for the swift and decisive nature of God's judgment. The imagery of strung bows is also found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/jeremiah/50-14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>, where it describes the readiness of Babylon's enemies.<p><b>The hooves of their horses are like flint</b><br>Flint is a hard, durable stone, and comparing the horses' hooves to flint suggests strength and resilience. Horses were a symbol of military power and speed in ancient times, and this description emphasizes the unstoppable force of the approaching army. The comparison to flint also implies that the army's advance is relentless and unyielding. This imagery can be linked to other biblical passages that describe the power and might of invading forces, such as in <a href="/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a>, where the appearance of horses is likened to the sound of chariots.<p><b>their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind</b><br>The whirlwind imagery conveys speed, chaos, and overwhelming power. Chariots were a formidable component of ancient military forces, and their rapid movement could cause panic and destruction. The comparison to a whirlwind suggests not only the speed but also the destructive capability of the army. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical descriptions of divine judgment, such as in <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, where the Lord's way is in the whirlwind and the storm. The whirlwind also symbolizes the swift execution of God's purposes, reflecting His sovereign control over the events of history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Their arrows are sharpened &#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>) pictures a force meticulously prepared for battle.<p>&#8226; Sharpened arrows communicate lethal precision; nothing about this invasion is haphazard (cf. <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13</a>, &#8220;He prepares His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The emphasis on readiness underscores that God&#8217;s judgment does not arrive half-formed; He brings it through a well-equipped army (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/50-14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the surrounding verses speak of God &#8220;raising a banner for distant nations&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>), the sharpened arrows show the certainty of His announced discipline on Judah&#8217;s complacency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all their bows are strung</b><p>Once bows are strung, there is no delay between intent and action.<p>&#8226; The invaders keep weapons constantly tensioned, illustrating relentless resolve (cf. <a href="/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a>, &#8220;For behold, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrow on the string&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s leaders had presumed they could manage external threats, yet God reveals attackers already poised to release judgment (cf. <a href="/amos/2-15.htm">Amos 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The image confronts any notion that divine warnings are empty; a strung bow reminds that God&#8217;s word is both promise and performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The hooves of their horses are like flint</b><p>Flint evokes hardness and spark-creating impact.<p>&#8226; Horses pounding ground with flint-like hooves signal unstoppable momentum (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15-17</a>, where the enemy&#8217;s horses are &#8220;swifter than leopards&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This strength is God-granted: He controls even the temperament of warhorses (<a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah had trusted in alliances and cavalry of its own (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), yet God now turns another nation&#8217;s cavalry against them, exposing misplaced confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind</b><p>The whirlwind image blends speed, noise, and disorientation.<p>&#8226; Chariots racing with cyclone force mean the land will feel overwhelmed (cf. <a href="/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3-4</a>, which describes chariots flashing like fire).<p>&#8226; Whirlwinds in Scripture often mark God&#8217;s direct intervention (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>). Here, the enemy&#8217;s machinery becomes the very whirlwind of divine presence in judgment.<p>&#8226; For the faithful remnant, the whirlwind also hints that God can later reverse calamity with equal swiftness (<a href="/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of an invading army&#8212;arrows honed, bows strung, horses unstoppable, chariots roaring.

What appears as the might of foreign soldiers is, in truth, the orchestrated hand of the Lord, proving His warnings sure and His sovereignty absolute, while calling hearts back to reverent trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.</span> The special weapon of the Assyrian soldiers is the bow.
