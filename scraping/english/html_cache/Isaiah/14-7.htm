In the context of <a href="/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>, it follows the downfall of Babylon, symbolizing the end of oppression and tyranny. Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire known for its conquests and harsh rule, so its fall would indeed bring relief to many nations. This peace can be seen as a foreshadowing of the peace that Christ brings, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace." The imagery of rest also connects to the Sabbath rest, a theme throughout Scripture that points to spiritual rest in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>they break out in song.</b><br>The response of breaking out in song signifies joy and celebration, a common biblical reaction to deliverance and divine intervention. In <a href="/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>, after the Israelites crossed the Red Sea and escaped Pharaoh's army, they sang a song of praise to God. Similarly, in <a href="/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>, the redeemed sing the song of Moses and the Lamb, celebrating God's victory over evil. This phrase in <a href="/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a> suggests a spontaneous and communal expression of gratitude and relief, highlighting the transformative power of God's justice and the joy that follows liberation from oppression. The act of singing also serves as a form of worship, acknowledging God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
