The "Name of the LORD" signifies His presence and authority. In biblical times, a name represented the essence and power of a person. The idea of God coming "from afar" suggests His sovereignty over all creation, not limited by time or space. This can be connected to other scriptures where God's presence is described as coming from a distance, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where God comes with ten thousand holy ones.<p><b>with burning anger and dense smoke</b><br>The imagery of "burning anger" and "dense smoke" conveys God's righteous judgment. Fire and smoke are often associated with divine presence and judgment in the Bible, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-28</a>) and the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). This reflects God's holiness and intolerance of sin, emphasizing the seriousness of His impending judgment.<p><b>His lips are full of fury</b><br>The "lips" symbolize the spoken word of God, which is powerful and effective. God's fury is expressed through His word, which can bring about both creation and destruction. This is reminiscent of the prophetic declarations found throughout the Old Testament, where God's word through the prophets often carried messages of judgment and hope. The power of God's word is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and His tongue is like a consuming fire</b><br>The "tongue" as a "consuming fire" further illustrates the destructive power of God's judgment. Fire is a purifying and consuming force, often used in scripture to depict God's holiness and judgment. This can be linked to <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, which describes God as a "consuming fire." The imagery underscores the seriousness of God's judgment against sin and the purifying effect of His presence. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that will come through Jesus Christ, who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's divine authority and power.
