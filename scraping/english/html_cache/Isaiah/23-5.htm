Egypt, a powerful nation with significant trade relations, would be deeply affected by the fall of Tyre, a major Phoenician port city known for its commerce and wealth. The report reaching Egypt signifies the widespread impact of Tyre's downfall, emphasizing the city's importance in the region. Historically, Egypt relied on trade routes through Tyre for goods and resources, making the news of its destruction particularly distressing.<p><b>they will writhe in agony</b><br>The phrase "writhe in agony" conveys intense emotional and possibly economic distress. This reaction underscores the dependency of surrounding nations on Tyre's prosperity. The imagery of writhing suggests a visceral response, indicating the severity of the impact on Egypt. This can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment, where the consequences of Tyre's fall extend beyond its borders, affecting those who were economically tied to it.<p><b>over the news of Tyre</b><br>Tyre was renowned for its wealth, strategic location, and influence in maritime trade. The "news of Tyre" refers to its prophesied destruction, which would have been shocking given its fortified position and economic power. Biblically, Tyre is often associated with pride and self-sufficiency, leading to its judgment by God. The fall of Tyre serves as a warning against hubris and reliance on material wealth, echoing themes found in other scriptures such as <a href="/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26-28</a>, where Tyre's judgment is detailed. This event foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's sovereignty over human pride and the transient nature of earthly power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient and wealthy Phoenician city known for its trade and commerce.
