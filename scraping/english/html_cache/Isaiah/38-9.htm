His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. Hezekiah's leadership was marked by significant religious reforms, including the removal of high places and the destruction of idols. His trust in God was evident during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, where he sought divine intervention and was delivered from the threat. The mention of "writing" indicates a personal reflection or testimony, which was a common practice for kings and leaders to document significant events or divine encounters.<p><b>after his illness and recovery:</b><br>Hezekiah's illness is described in <a href="/isaiah/38.htm">Isaiah 38:1-8</a> and <a href="/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20:1-11</a>, where he was struck with a life-threatening condition. The prophet Isaiah informed him that he would not recover, but after Hezekiah's fervent prayer, God extended his life by 15 years. This miraculous recovery was confirmed by a sign from God, where the shadow on the sundial moved backward. The illness and subsequent healing highlight themes of divine mercy, the power of prayer, and God's sovereignty over life and death. This event also serves as a type of resurrection, prefiguring the ultimate healing and restoration found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>Hezekiah was the king of Judah who reigned during a time of great political and spiritual turmoil.

Scripture often preserves personal writings to invite readers into the author&#8217;s heart (cf. <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>, &#8220;A prayer of Moses the man of God,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Here, Isaiah signals that what follows is more than narrative&#8212;it is Hezekiah&#8217;s own testimony, echoing how David&#8217;s psalms arose from real-life crises (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures us that the record is firsthand, underscoring the reliability of the account (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Hezekiah king of Judah</b><p>&#8226; The king himself pens these words, reminding us that leaders, too, must wrestle personally with God (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-24.htm">2 Chronicles 32:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah was known for faithfulness, yet his psalm will reveal vulnerability&#8212;similar to David&#8217;s confession in <a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1-3</a>.<p>&#8226; His royal position magnifies the testimony&#8217;s impact: if a king bows in gratitude, so should every subject (<a href="/psalms/138-4.htm">Psalm 138:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after his illness and recovery</b><p>&#8226;

The verse highlights (1) the authenticity of a firsthand testimony, (2) the humility of a king who publicly credits God, and (3) the transforming power of divine healing. Together, these truths call every reader to remember God&#8217;s mercies, declare them openly, and live gratefully in the added days He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The writing of Hezekiah . . .</span>--<a href="/context/isaiah/38-21.htm" title="For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover.">Isaiah 38:21-22</a> would seem to have their right place before the elegiac psalm that follows.
