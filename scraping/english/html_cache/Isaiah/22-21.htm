In ancient Near Eastern cultures, clothing often symbolized one's status and role. The robe represents the office and responsibilities of a high-ranking official. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, this refers to the transfer of authority from Shebna, a steward in King Hezekiah's court, to Eliakim. This act of clothing Eliakim with the robe signifies his new role and the trust placed in him. Biblically, clothing is often used to denote righteousness and authority, as seen in Joseph's coat of many colors (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>) and the garments of the high priest (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2-4</a>).<p><b>and tie your sash around him</b><br>The sash, or belt, was an essential part of a person's attire in biblical times, often symbolizing strength and readiness for service. It was also a sign of dignity and office. By tying the sash around Eliakim, it indicates that he is being equipped and prepared for his new responsibilities. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to gird themselves with truth, symbolizing readiness and commitment to God's service.<p><b>I will put your authority in his hand</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transfer of power and responsibility. The hand is often a symbol of action and control in the Bible. By placing authority in Eliakim's hand, it signifies that he is being entrusted with the power to act on behalf of the king and the people. This mirrors the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are given authority to manage and lead according to God's will, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><b>and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah</b><br>Being a "father" in this context implies a role of leadership, guidance, and care. Eliakim is to be a protector and provider for the people, much like a father is to his family. This paternal role is significant in the biblical narrative, as leaders are often seen as shepherds or fathers to their people, responsible for their well-being and spiritual guidance. This concept is fulfilled in the ultimate sense by Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Everlasting Father" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, highlighting His eternal care and leadership over His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliakim.htm">Eliakim</a></b><br>The individual who is being clothed with authority in this passage.

Eliakim&#8217;s new robe foreshadows that ultimate, gracious covering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>tie your sash around him</b><p>A sash (or belt) held the robe in place and often carried symbols of rank.<p>&#8226; Fastening the sash communicates readiness and faithfulness in service&#8212;imagery echoed when Jesus tells His servants to be &#8220;dressed for service&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The priestly sash set Aaron apart for holy duty (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>), and the warrior&#8217;s belt prepared him for battle (<a href="/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a>). God equips Eliakim for both administrative and spiritual responsibilities.<p>&#8226; Because the Lord personally &#8220;ties&#8221; it, the new steward&#8217;s authority rests not on politics but on divine commissioning (<a href="/psalms/20-6.htm">Psalm 20:6</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will put your authority in his hand</b><p>With the robe and sash comes actual power: &#8220;I will put your authority in his hand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In ancient courts the steward carried official seals or keys&#8212;tools that granted or denied access (<a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/esther/3-10.htm">Esther 3:10</a>). Verse 22 elaborates, &#8220;I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Handing over authority underscores accountability. Eliakim manages resources and defends the city under God&#8217;s watch (<a href="/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus applies this language to Himself: &#8220;I have the key of David&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>). Eliakim&#8217;s role thus previews the perfect sovereignty of Christ, who opens and no one shuts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah</b><p>The final promise shifts from function to character: leadership expressed in fatherly care.<p>&#8226; A father protects, provides, and instructs (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11&#8211;12</a>). Eliakim is to shepherd Jerusalem, not exploit it, contrasting with Shebna&#8217;s self-promotion (<a href="/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Davidic rulers were expected to model God&#8217;s fatherly heart (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). Eliakim&#8217;s service anticipates Christ, &#8220;the Good Shepherd&#8221; who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;house of Judah&#8221; broadens the reach&#8212;true leadership blesses all God&#8217;s people, uniting them in covenant faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/31-1.htm">Jeremiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21</a> records God replacing a proud steward with a faithful one.

The dress of office worn by Shebna would be taken from him, and Eliakim would be invested therewith. The "robe" is the long-sleeved cloak or tunic worn commonly by persons of rank; the "girdle" is probably an ornamental one, like those of the priests (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), worn over the inner tunic. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be a father</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a protector, counselor, guide (comp. <a href="/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a>, "I was <span class="accented">a father to the poor</span>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out"). It is, perhaps, implied that Shebna had not conducted himself as a "father." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will clothe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hil&#183;ba&#353;&#183;t&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
