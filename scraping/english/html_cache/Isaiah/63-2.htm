The imagery of red clothing is symbolic and often associated with judgment and wrath in biblical literature. In the context of Isaiah, this red color is indicative of blood, suggesting a divine warrior who has been engaged in battle. The color red is also significant in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where blood was a central element in atonement rituals, pointing to the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. This imagery can be connected to <a href="/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>, where Christ is depicted wearing a robe dipped in blood, symbolizing His role as the ultimate judge and redeemer.<p><b>and Your garments like one who treads the winepress?</b><br>The winepress imagery is a powerful metaphor for judgment. In ancient times, treading the winepress involved crushing grapes to extract juice, which is likened to the execution of divine judgment upon the nations. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>, to depict God's wrath being poured out. The act of treading the winepress signifies the thoroughness and inevitability of divine judgment. Historically, winepresses were common in Israel and surrounding regions, and the process was well understood by the original audience, making it a vivid illustration of God's power and justice. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of the age, where Christ, as the righteous judge, will execute justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage is addressing the Lord, who is depicted as having garments stained red, symbolizing judgment and wrath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/63.htm">Isaiah 63</a> includes Edom, representing nations opposed to God and His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/winepress.htm">Winepress</a></b><br>A metaphorical place where grapes are crushed to produce wine, symbolizing God's judgment and the execution of His wrath upon the nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The imagery of the winepress underscores the severity of sin and the certainty of divine judgment.

In plain sight His garments are stained scarlet.<p>&#8226; The scene follows 63:1, where One &#8220;coming from Edom, with crimson-stained garments from Bozrah&#8221; declares, &#8220;It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.&#8221; The flow makes clear this is no ordinary traveler but the LORD Himself, appearing after a decisive act of judgment.<p>&#8226; The color red here is not metaphorical only; it represents literal bloodshed&#8212;the aftermath of divine justice (<a href="/isaiah/34-2.htm">Isaiah 34:2-6</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophetic picture anticipates Christ&#8217;s return as conquering King (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-13</a>), where He is again seen in a robe &#8220;dipped in blood.&#8221; The linkage underscores the consistency of Scripture: the same Warrior appears in both Testaments, proving the reliability of God&#8217;s Word.<p>&#8226; Red clothing contrasts sharply with His holy character (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>); yet the Judge willingly dons garments spattered with the blood of His enemies to vindicate His people (<a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Your garments like one who treads the winepress</b><p>Winepress imagery deepens the explanation. In ancient Israel grapes were crushed barefoot in a pit; juice splashed onto the workers&#8217; robes.<p>&#8226; The LORD says in the next verse, &#8220;I have trodden the winepress alone&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>). No human army assists Him; salvation and vengeance are entirely His work (<a href="/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The winepress symbolizes total, crushing judgment. Just as every grape yields its juice, every unrepentant foe will face His wrath (<a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, this fierce image is also comforting: the same Messiah who shed His own blood for redemption will shed His enemies&#8217; blood for final justice, ensuring evil is not left unanswered (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The solitary treader highlights His unique qualifications&#8212;only the sinless, sovereign Lord can both save and judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2</a> pictures the LORD Jesus returning from judgment, His garments reddened like a wine-treader&#8217;s.
