Historically, Israel faced numerous oppressors, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians. This prophecy suggests a future time when the descendants of these oppressors will acknowledge Israel's elevated status. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also echoes the theme of divine justice and vindication found throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>all who reviled you will fall facedown at your feet</b><br>The act of falling facedown is a sign of deep respect and submission, often associated with worship or acknowledgment of authority. In the ancient Near Eastern context, this gesture was common when approaching a king or deity. This imagery suggests a complete reversal of the scorn and contempt Israel faced from surrounding nations. It reflects the biblical theme of God exalting the humble and humbling the proud (<a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>, <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>).<p><b>and call you the City of the LORD,</b><br>This phrase identifies the city, likely Jerusalem, as belonging to the LORD, signifying divine ownership and presence. Jerusalem holds a central place in biblical history as the location of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. This title emphasizes the city's spiritual significance and its role as a focal point for worship and divine revelation. It also points to a future eschatological hope where Jerusalem is recognized universally as God's city (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>).<p><b>Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</b><br>Zion is often used synonymously with Jerusalem and represents the spiritual and political heart of Israel. The "Holy One of Israel" is a title for God that underscores His uniqueness, holiness, and covenant relationship with Israel. This phrase reinforces the idea of God's special connection to Zion and His commitment to its restoration and exaltation. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem, where God's presence will dwell eternally with His people (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppressors.htm">Oppressors</a></b><br>Refers to those who have historically persecuted or subjugated the people of Israel.

Think of <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a> where nations &#8220;take them and bring them to their own place,&#8221; or 49:23 in which kings become &#8220;foster fathers&#8221; and queens &#8220;nursing mothers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bowing signals public recognition that God has vindicated His people. <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a> echoes this: &#8220;I will make them come and bow down at your feet and know that I have loved you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The picture anticipates Christ&#8217;s universal reign when &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>). What once was forced subjugation under pagan rulers becomes voluntary homage because of God&#8217;s unmistakable work in Zion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All who reviled you will fall facedown at your feet</b><p>&#8226; Mockery, scorn, and persecution have marked Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/psalms/44-13.htm">Psalm 44:13-14</a>). Yet God promises reversal: enemies will &#8220;fall facedown,&#8221; a posture of total submission, recalling <a href="/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a> where desert tribes &#8220;bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a> assures, &#8220;No weapon formed against you shall prosper&#8230;and you shall condemn every tongue that rises against you.&#8221; Here is the fulfillment&#8212;those tongues are silenced.<p>&#8226; The scene also prefigures final judgment imagery (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>) when all hostility toward God&#8217;s kingdom is put down. Until then, individual conversions among former persecutors (e.g., Saul of Tarsus in <a href="/bsb/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>) preview this larger promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And will call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Not only do former enemies submit; they confess Zion&#8217;s new name and status. Compare <a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>, &#8220;You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will designate,&#8221; and <a href="/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a>, &#8220;Jerusalem will be called the Throne of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;City of the LORD&#8221; shifts focus from the people to the presence of God within them. <a href="/psalms/87-3.htm">Psalm 87:3</a>: &#8220;Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ultimately this points to the eschatological New Jerusalem where &#8220;the nations will walk by its light&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 24</a>).

The promise assures God&#8217;s people of vindication, the humbling of hostility, and global recognition of the LORD&#8217;s presence&#8212;anticipating both Israel&#8217;s restoration and the ultimate reign of Christ when every knee will bow and every tongue confess His lordship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/60.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The sons also of them that afflicted thee . . .</span>--The explanation commonly given is that the "sons" are named because the persecutors themselves are thought of as no more. It seems better, however, to see in the words an expression of the law of inherited retribution, which entered so largely into the Hebrew's thought of the moral government of the world. That law will show itself in the prostrate homage with which the descendants of the old oppressors will recognise that the restored city is indeed the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/60.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> descendants) <span class="accented">also </span>of them that afflicted thee; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the various nations that at different times oppressed and afflicted Israel - as Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, Assyrians, Babylonians, Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Shall come bending</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto thee.</span> Bowing themselves down to the new Israel - the Israel of God - as the eleven sheaves bowed themselves down to Joseph's sheaf (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At the soles of thy feet</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>).
