The term "Lord GOD" is a translation of the Hebrew "Adonai Yahweh," highlighting both His sovereignty and covenant relationship with Israel. The context of <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a> is a message of comfort and hope to the exiled Israelites, assuring them of God's imminent intervention. The imagery of God coming with might reflects His ability to deliver and restore His people, reminiscent of His mighty acts during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). This also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who embodies divine power and authority (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>and His arm establishes His rule</b><br>The "arm" of God is a metaphor for His strength and active involvement in the world. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the arm symbolized power and the ability to accomplish one's will. This phrase suggests God's direct intervention to establish His kingdom, a theme prevalent throughout Isaiah. It connects to the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, where the "arm of the LORD" is revealed in the suffering servant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who establishes God's rule through His life, death, and resurrection.<p><b>His reward is with Him</b><br>This phrase indicates that God brings blessings and rewards for His people. In the historical context, it reassures the Israelites of the restoration and prosperity that will follow their return from exile. Biblically, rewards often accompany God's presence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>, where God promises Abram a great reward. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include eternal rewards for believers (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>), highlighting the ultimate fulfillment in Christ's return.<p><b>and His recompense accompanies Him</b><br>Recompense refers to the just and fair repayment for actions. In the context of Isaiah, it implies both the judgment of the wicked and the vindication of the righteous. This dual aspect of God's justice is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>, where God repays each according to their deeds. Theologically, it points to the final judgment, where Christ will execute perfect justice (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>), rewarding the faithful and punishing the unrepentant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing the sovereign and powerful God of Israel, who is coming with might.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_arm.htm">His Arm</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's power and strength, often used in the Old Testament to denote His ability to save and deliver His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/reward_and_recompense.htm">Reward and Recompense</a></b><br>These terms indicate the justice and faithfulness of God, who brings both blessings and judgments according to His righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_power.htm">God's Sovereign Power</a></b><br>Recognize that God is all-powerful and sovereign over all creation.
