The imagery of God as a mighty one is consistent with descriptions found in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, where God is called a "man of war." This reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where deities were often portrayed as warriors leading their people into battle. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over evil, a theme that resonates throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>He stirs up His zeal like a warrior.</b><br>The concept of divine zeal is significant in the Hebrew Bible, indicating God's passionate commitment to His purposes and His people. This zeal is not just emotional fervor but a determined action to achieve justice and righteousness. The warrior imagery suggests preparation for battle, highlighting God's active role in defending His people and executing judgment. This can be connected to the zeal of Jesus in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, where His cleansing of the temple is described as fulfilling the prophecy, "Zeal for your house will consume me."<p><b>He shouts; yes, He roars in triumph over His enemies:</b><br>The shouting and roaring signify a victorious battle cry, underscoring God's supremacy over His adversaries. This is reminiscent of the lion imagery used in <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>, where the lion's roar symbolizes the certainty of God's word and actions. The triumph over enemies is a recurring theme in the Psalms and prophetic literature, pointing to the eschatological hope of God's ultimate victory over evil. This victory is typified in the life and work of Jesus Christ, who, through His death and resurrection, triumphed over sin and death, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as a mighty warrior, emphasizing His power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_warrior.htm">Mighty Warrior</a></b><br>A metaphor for God&#8217;s strength and determination in defending His people and executing His plans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who oppose God and His purposes, representing both spiritual and physical adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_zeal_and_passion.htm">God&#8217;s Zeal and Passion</a></b><br>God is not passive; He is actively involved in the world, passionately working to fulfill His purposes.

From the beginning, God reveals Himself as the One who takes the field for His people.<p>&#8226; When Isaiah says He &#8220;goes forth,&#8221; it pictures decisive, purposeful movement. God is not reacting; He is advancing. See also <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>, where He is called &#8220;the King of glory, strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: we do not send God into our circumstances; He is already moving ahead of us, leading the charge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He stirs up His zeal like a warrior</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head; He put on garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in zeal as in a cloak&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>). God&#8217;s zeal is His burning determination to uphold His holiness and redeem His people.<p>&#8226; Zeal here is not fleeting emotion but covenant fidelity. <a href="/zechariah/1-14.htm">Zechariah 1:14</a> assures, &#8220;I am zealous for Jerusalem and Zion with great jealousy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In human battles, passion can wane.

The exhortation to "sing unto the Lord a new song" ends with ver. 12, and now the reason or groundwork for the exhortation has to be declared. God is about to make one of the great manifestations of his power upon the earth - to "<span class="accented">go</span> forth" against his enemies, and destroy and devour, and easily prevail against them - not, however, simply in the way of punishment and vengeance, but with a further merciful object. He will punish Babylon, that he may deliver Israel. He has promised not to forsake his people (<a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). He is now about to give effect to his promise by a "new" and strange deliverance. He "will bring his people by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known" (ver. 16). It has been said that "in effect it is the day of judgment which is here described" (Cheyne); but this seems to be only so far true as every manifestation of God's wrath towards his enemies is a foreshadowing of the great and awful day. The event directly in view is the destruction of the Babylonian power by the irresistible arms of Cyrus. Hence the allusion to idolaters and images in ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">As a mighty man... like a man of war</span>. (For similar anthropomorpbisms, see <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He shall stir up jealousy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own jealousy.

He is jealous for his own honour (<span class="accented">supra</span>, ver. 8), and jealous also for his people's honour and reputation and happiness. Occasionally he allows his jealousy to slumber (comp. <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>:30, "The times of this ignorance God winked at"); and this he had now done for some fifty or sixty years, since his people were carried into captivity. But the time of acquiescence has gone by - he is about to waken up his "smouldering jealousy, and stir it, till it burns up into a bright flame" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">He shall cry, yea, roar</span>;
