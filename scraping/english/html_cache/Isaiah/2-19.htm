The caves and holes symbolize a desperate attempt to find safety, highlighting the severity of the situation. This phrase echoes the fear and helplessness experienced during divine judgment, reminiscent of the fear described in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-16</a>, where people hide in caves from the wrath of the Lamb.<p><b>away from the terror of the LORD</b><br>The "terror of the LORD" refers to the overwhelming fear and awe that God's presence and judgment inspire. This phrase underscores the holiness and power of God, which is often depicted as a consuming fire (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The terror is not merely emotional but is a response to the reality of God's righteous judgment against sin, as seen in other prophetic texts like <a href="/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>.<p><b>and from the splendor of His majesty</b><br>The "splendor of His majesty" contrasts with the terror, emphasizing God's glory and sovereign authority. This duality of fear and majesty is a common theme in Scripture, illustrating the complexity of God's nature. The majesty of God is often associated with His kingship and divine rule, as seen in <a href="/psalms/96-6.htm">Psalm 96:6</a>, where strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.<p><b>when He rises to shake the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine intervention in human history, often associated with eschatological events. The shaking of the earth symbolizes a profound upheaval, both physically and spiritually, as God asserts His dominion. This concept is echoed in <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>, where God promises to shake not only the earth but also the heavens, signifying the coming of a new order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Refers to humanity in general, highlighting the universal nature of the fear and awe inspired by God's presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/caves_in_the_rocks_and_holes_in_the_ground.htm">Caves in the rocks and holes in the ground</a></b><br>Symbolic of places of refuge and hiding, representing the futility of trying to escape God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His authority and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_splendor_of_his_majesty.htm">The Splendor of His Majesty</a></b><br>Describes the overwhelming glory and holiness of God, which causes fear and reverence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/when_he_rises_to_shake_the_earth.htm">When He rises to shake the earth</a></b><br>An event of divine intervention and judgment, illustrating God's active role in the world.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Inevitability of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is certain and unavoidable.

Similar scenes show up in <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, where kings and commanders beg mountains to fall on them. From <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a> onward, the sinful heart&#8217;s instinct has been to hide from a holy God rather than repent. The image underlines how completely human self-confidence collapses when the Lord visibly intervenes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And holes in the ground</b><p>Holes, crevices, even animal dens&#8212;nothing is too small if it offers a momentary refuge. <a href="/judges/6-2.htm">Judges 6:2</a> records Israel hiding in caves when Midian oppressed them; <a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a> describes warriors squeezing into pits during Philistine threats. Isaiah shows that in the ultimate day of reckoning the entire earth becomes one big foxhole, yet none of those holes can shield a soul from divine presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Away from the terror of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Terror&#8221; is not random fear but the awful realization that God&#8217;s righteous wrath is now active. <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a> reminds us, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221; <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6</a> asks, &#8220;Who can stand before His indignation?&#8221; Isaiah&#8217;s contemporaries placed confidence in alliances and idols; the prophet says terror will dismantle every false refuge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And from the splendor of His majesty</b><p>God&#8217;s glory is beautiful, yet to the unrepentant it blazes like consuming fire (<a href="/exodus/24-17.htm">Exodus 24:17</a>). <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a> records the prophet himself undone by a single vision of that splendor. <a href="/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3-6</a> pictures mountains shattering before the radiant King. The combination of beauty and unbearable purity drives rebellious hearts to seek cover rather than bow in worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When He rises to shake the earth</b><p>The phrase points to a specific, future intervention&#8212;&#8220;the day of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>). <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a> and <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a> echo the promise that God will once more shake not only earth but also heaven, removing all that is temporary so only the unshakable remains. Earthquakes in <a href="/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13 and 16</a>:18-20 preview that cosmic upheaval. Isaiah assures us this is not poetic exaggeration; the Creator will literally rock the planet to expose every foundation other than Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of the coming day when the Lord personally intervenes in cataclysmic judgment. People will abandon status and possessions, diving into any crevice they can find, because God&#8217;s holy presence will overwhelm every false security. The terror springs from His righteous wrath; the splendor comes from His radiant majesty. Both converge when He rises to shake the earth, fulfilling promises repeated throughout Scripture. The passage urges humble repentance now, while grace is offered, so that on that day we stand in joyful awe rather than frantic flight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And they shall go into the holes of the rocks.</span>--The imagery of the earthquake in Uzziah's reign (see Note on <a href="/isaiah/2-10.htm" title="Enter into the rock, and hide you in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.">Isaiah 2:10</a>) is still present to Isaiah's thoughts.
