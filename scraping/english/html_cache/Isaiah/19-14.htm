The "spirit of confusion" suggests a supernatural disorientation, reminiscent of the confusion at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7-9</a>). In biblical terms, a "spirit" often refers to an influence or disposition that affects behavior and decision-making. This confusion can be seen as a judgment from God, similar to how He hardened Pharaoh's heart in Exodus. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to direct their paths according to His purposes.<p><b>Egypt has been led astray in all she does,</b><br>Historically, Egypt was a powerful and influential nation, often seen as a symbol of worldly wisdom and strength. Being "led astray" implies a departure from wisdom and truth, leading to poor decisions and chaos. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of nations turning away from God and facing consequences, as seen in the stories of Israel and Judah. The phrase also reflects the futility of relying on human wisdom and power instead of seeking divine guidance.<p><b>as a drunkard staggers through his own vomit.</b><br>This vivid imagery portrays the depth of Egypt's confusion and helplessness. The comparison to a drunkard suggests a loss of control and dignity, highlighting the shame and degradation that comes from turning away from God. In <a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a>, drunkenness is associated with woe and sorrow, symbolizing the self-destructive nature of sin. This imagery serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and self-reliance, contrasting with the order and clarity found in following God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who exercises authority over nations and peoples, including Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and opposition to God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_confusion.htm">Spirit of Confusion</a></b><br>A divinely sent state of disorder and chaos, affecting the decision-making and stability of Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/drunkard.htm">Drunkard</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe Egypt's inability to function properly due to the confusion inflicted by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God has the authority to influence and direct the affairs of nations according to His purposes.

Here He &#8220;pours&#8221; confusion, not merely allowing it but directing it, just as He once &#8220;sent a spirit of ill will&#8221; between Abimelech and Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a>) or permitted &#8220;a harmful spirit&#8221; to trouble Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This divine act is judgment: when people persist in idolatry, God sometimes gives them over to the very darkness they choose (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Confusion includes political turmoil, failed counsel, and fractured alliances&#8212;echoing the earlier verse, &#8220;I will frustrate their plans&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Egypt has been led astray in all she does</b><p>&#8226; The result is total: &#8220;all she does&#8221; implies every sector&#8212;religion, economy, diplomacy, military.

False gods cannot guide (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). Yet God Himself is behind the judgment, underscoring His right to rule the nations (<a href="/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This also foreshadows future collapses of human pride wherever people trust horses and chariots rather than the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a drunkard staggers through his own vomit</b><p>&#8226; The simile paints humiliating helplessness: drunkenness clouds thinking; vomit adds disgust.

Those in whom this spirit was had then "led Egypt astray in all her doings." They had made her "like a drunken man," who "staggers" along his path, and slips in "his own vomit." Long-continued success and prosperity produces often a sort of intoxication in a nation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/19-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has poured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;sa&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4537.htm">Strong's 4537: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mix, produce by mixing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;qir&#183;b&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
