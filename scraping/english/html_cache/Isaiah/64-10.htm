The term "holy cities" indicates places that were dedicated to worship and the presence of God. The imagery of a "wilderness" suggests desolation and abandonment, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey through the desert. Historically, this devastation can be linked to the Babylonian conquest, which led to the destruction and depopulation of these cities. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-33</a>, where God warns of desolation if His statutes are not followed.<p><b>Zion has become a wasteland</b><br>Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, holds significant spiritual and historical importance as the city of David and the location of the Temple. The term "wasteland" conveys a sense of barrenness and ruin, highlighting the severity of the judgment that has fallen upon it. This desolation fulfills the prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who spoke of the impending destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness. Zion's transformation into a wasteland also foreshadows the need for spiritual renewal and restoration, pointing to the future hope of redemption and the coming of the Messiah, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-5</a>.<p><b>and Jerusalem a desolation.</b><br>Jerusalem, the heart of Jewish worship and identity, being described as a "desolation" underscores the complete and utter ruin that has befallen the city. This devastation is a direct result of the people's disobedience and idolatry, as warned by prophets such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. The historical context of the Babylonian exile is crucial here, as it marks a period of profound loss and reflection for the Jewish people. Despite this, the desolation of Jerusalem also sets the stage for the promise of restoration and the coming of a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. This future hope is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual restoration and establishes a new Jerusalem, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, Zion is a symbol of God's chosen people and His dwelling place.

Spiritually, it reminds us that sin hollows out what was once set apart for God. When worship is replaced by rebellion, even places once called &#8220;holy&#8221; can become barren.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Zion has become a wasteland</b><p>&#8220;Zion&#8221; points to the Temple mount&#8212;the very heart of Israel&#8217;s worship.

Yet each time, God preserves a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>) and promises eventual renewal (<a href="/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1-5</a>). Desolation is never His last word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10</a> is a lament that takes the reader from the outlying &#8220;holy cities,&#8221; through the Temple mount, into the heart of Jerusalem&#8212;each layer stripped of life because covenant unfaithfulness invited righteous judgment. The verse speaks literally of Babylon&#8217;s destruction, and it speaks timelessly: holiness cannot coexist with willful sin, and even cherished places can be emptied when God&#8217;s people turn away. Yet embedded in the lament is hope; the same Lord who allowed the ruin also pledges restoration to all who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/64.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Thy holy cities . . .</span>--There is no other instance of the plural, and this probably led the LXX. and Vulg. to substitute the singular. It probably rests on the thought that the whole land was holy (<a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm" title="And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.">Zechariah 2:12</a>), and that this attribute extended, therefore, to all its cities, especially to those which were connected with historical memories. Possibly, however, Zion and Jerusalem--the former identified with the Temple, the latter with the people of Jehovah--are thought of as two distinct cities, locally united. The "wilderness" is, as elsewhere, rather open pasture-land than a sandy desert.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/64.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy holy cities are a wilderness.</span> Commonly Jerusalem stands alone as "the holy city" (<a href="/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1, 18</a>); but here the epithet is applied to the cities of Judah generally. They were all in a certain sense "holy," as being comprised within the limits of "the holy land" (<a href="/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>) and "the holy border" (<a href="/psalms/78-54.htm">Psalm 78:54</a>).
