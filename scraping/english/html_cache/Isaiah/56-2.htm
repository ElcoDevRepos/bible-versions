In the context of Isaiah, this blessing is linked to obedience to God's commands. The "man who does this" refers to those who adhere to the principles outlined in the preceding verses, emphasizing justice and righteousness. This echoes the covenantal promises found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. The use of "man" here is inclusive, referring to all people who follow God's ways.<p><b>and the son of man who holds it fast</b><br>The phrase "son of man" is a Hebrew idiom for humanity, emphasizing the universality of the message. "Holds it fast" suggests perseverance and commitment to God's commands. This steadfastness is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>, where the righteous are described as trees planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in season. The call to hold fast is a call to remain faithful amidst challenges.<p><b>who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it</b><br>The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>. Keeping the Sabbath holy is a commandment that signifies trust in God's provision and a commitment to rest and worship. Profaning the Sabbath was a serious offense, as it indicated a disregard for God's law and order. In the New Testament, Jesus reinterprets the Sabbath, emphasizing its purpose for human benefit (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>). The Sabbath also points to the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>and keeps his hand from doing any evil.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of moral integrity and ethical behavior. The hand symbolizes action, and keeping it from evil implies a conscious effort to avoid sin. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on holiness and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which describes those who may stand in God's holy place as having clean hands and a pure heart. The call to avoid evil is a call to live in a way that reflects God's character and commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

It is almost certain that the counsellors of the young Manasseh (probably the Shebna party), abandoning the religion of Israel in other things, would also disregard this. I take the prophet's teaching accordingly as directed against that evil. He utters his beatitude for those who are faithful to the <span class= "ital">regime </span>of Hezekiah's reign, even though their alien birth or their condition as eunuchs seemed to exclude them from the polity of Israel (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-1.htm" title="He that is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 23:1-8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/56.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That doeth this... that layeth hold on it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that doeth according to the exhortation in ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">That keepeth the sabbath</span>. The prominent place assigned to this duty by the evangelical prophet is remarkable. We may observe, however, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the spirit of obedience is better tested by a positive than by a moral ordinance; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that as, probably, there could be little outward keeping of the sabbath by the captives, it would have had to be kept inwardly by spiritual exercises, by silent prayer and praise, together with prolonged meditation upon holy things. In the absence of all the ordinary aids to devotion, the religious condition of the people must have depended very much on their keeping up the recollection of the sabbath, and hallowing it so far as was possible; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> doing no work for themselves, neither buying nor selling, making their devotions longer, and keeping God in their thoughts throughout the day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/56-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Blessed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_835.htm">Strong's 835: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happiness, interjection, how happy!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who does</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
