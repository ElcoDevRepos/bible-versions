The "Valley of Vision" is a poetic name for Jerusalem, known for its prophets and spiritual insight. Despite its spiritual heritage, the city is facing impending judgment due to its people's unfaithfulness. Jerusalem's location in a valley surrounded by hills may contribute to this designation. The phrase sets the tone for a message of warning and impending doom, highlighting the contrast between the city's spiritual potential and its current state of moral decline.<p><b>What ails you now,</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests a sudden and unexpected crisis. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are in a state of confusion and distress. Historically, this could refer to the Assyrian threat under King Sennacherib or the Babylonian siege. The question implies that the people should be aware of their spiritual condition and the reasons for their predicament, yet they seem oblivious or in denial.<p><b>that you have all gone up to the rooftops,</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, rooftops were flat and used for various activities, including social gatherings and observation. The act of going up to the rooftops could indicate panic or a desire to see approaching danger. It may also suggest a futile attempt to escape or find refuge. This behavior contrasts with the expected response of seeking God in times of trouble, highlighting the people's misplaced priorities and lack of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers the oracle.

If we think of the prophet's dwelling as being in the lower city, in the valley of Tyrop?on, the epithet becomes still more appropriate. That valley would be to him in very deed a "valley of vision," where he saw things present and to come. Possibly the name became more characteristic from the impulse given to the prophetic dreams of all who claimed to be seers. The prophet looks out, and sees the people in a state of excitement, caused probably by the near approach of the Assyrian armies. They are "on the house-tops," the flat roofs of which were a customary place of concourse (<a href="/judges/16-27.htm" title="Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.">Judges 16:27</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>), keeping their revels, as those do who meet the approach of danger with a reckless despair (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm" title="And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.">Isaiah 22:13</a>). By some commentators (Birks, Kay,) the "valley of vision" has been identified with Samaria. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM. The prophet, present in Jerusalem, either actually, or at any rate in spirit, <span class="accented">sees</span> the inhabitants crowded together upon the housetops, in a state of boisterous merriment (vers. 1, 2). Outside the walls is a foreign army threatening the town (vers. 5-7). Preparations have been made for resistance, which are described (vers. 8-11); but there has been no turning to God. On the contrary, the danger has but made the bulk of the people reckless. Instead of humbling themselves and putting on sackcloth, and weeping, and appealing to God's mercy, they have determined to drown care in drink and sensual enjoyment (vers. 12, 13). Therefore the prophet is bidden to denounce woe upon them, and threaten that Jehovah will not forgive their recklessness until their death (ver. 14). There is nothing to mark very distinctly the nationality of the foreign army; but it is certainly represented as made up of contingents from many nations. Delitzsch holds that the Assyrian armies were never so made up, or, at any rate, that the nations here mentioned never served in its ranks ('Site of Paradise,' p. 237); but this is, perhaps, assuming that our knowledge on the subject is more complete and exact than is really the case. It is almost impossible to imagine any other army than the Assyrian besieging Jerusalem in Isaiah's time. Moreover, the particulars concerning the preparations made against the enemy (vers. 9-11) agree with those mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30 as made by Hezekiah against Sennacherib. And the second section of the chapter has certainly reference to this period. It seems, therefore, reasonable to regard the siege intended as that conducted by Sennacherib in his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), of which we have a brief account in his annals (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, 11. 15-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The burden of the valley of vision</span>. "The valley of vision" is only mentioned here and in ver. 5. It must have been one of the deep depressions near Jerusalem troll which there is a good view of the town.
