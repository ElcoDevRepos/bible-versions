In the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern practices, turning to the wall could symbolize turning away from the world and towards God. This act reflects a deep sense of urgency and desperation, as Hezekiah was facing a terminal illness. The wall may also represent a boundary, indicating Hezekiah's desire to separate himself from his current circumstances and seek divine intervention.<p><b>and prayed to the LORD</b><br>Hezekiah's prayer to the LORD demonstrates his faith and reliance on God during a time of crisis. This moment is significant as it shows Hezekiah's understanding of the LORD as the ultimate source of help and healing. The act of prayer is a central theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing the importance of communication with God. Hezekiah's prayer is a model of earnest supplication, reflecting the biblical principle that God hears and responds to the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). This event is also connected to other instances where prayer led to divine intervention, such as Elijah's prayer for rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42-45</a>) and Daniel's prayer for understanding (<a href="/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.
