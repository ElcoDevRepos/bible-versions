Historically, Israel faced divine discipline due to their disobedience and idolatry, yet God's treatment of Israel is often portrayed as corrective rather than destructive. In contrast, the oppressors of Israel, such as Assyria and Babylon, faced total destruction. This reflects God's covenant relationship with Israel, where discipline is meant to restore rather than annihilate. Theologically, this highlights God's justice and mercy, balancing punishment with the promise of redemption. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>, where God promises to discipline Israel but not to make a full end of them.<p><b>Was she killed like those who slayed her?</b><br>This phrase suggests a distinction in the outcomes for Israel and her enemies. While Israel suffered consequences for her sins, the ultimate fate of her oppressors was often more severe. Historically, nations that oppressed Israel, such as Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, experienced downfall and destruction. This reflects the biblical principle that God uses nations as instruments of judgment but holds them accountable for their actions. Theologically, it underscores the idea of divine justice and the protective nature of God's covenant with Israel. This is consistent with the prophetic assurance found in <a href="/isaiah/54-7.htm">Isaiah 54:7-8</a>, where God promises to gather Israel with great compassion after a period of discipline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

The Lord invites Israel to compare how He deals with her to how He deals with those who hate her.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s blows against His people are measured, corrective, and covenant-based. Compare <a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will discipline you justly, but I will by no means leave you unpunished,&#8221; with <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;For the Lord disciplines the one He loves.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By contrast, He smites Israel&#8217;s oppressors with unrelieved, decisive judgment. See <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24-27</a> (Assyria&#8217;s yoke broken) and <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a> (Egypt struck in finality).<p>&#8226; The question expects a &#8220;no.&#8221; Israel has experienced painful chastisement, yet never the annihilating blow aimed at Egypt, Assyria, or Babylon. God&#8217;s covenant promises (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28-29</a>) ensure Israel&#8217;s survival.<p>&#8226; Discipline that separates from sin but preserves life reflects the Lord&#8217;s fatherly heart, while the overthrow of oppressors showcases His holy justice (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was she killed like those who slayed her?</b><p>&#8220;Was she slain like those who slaughtered her?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a>b)<p>&#8226; The oppressors&#8212;think of Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar&#8212;meet ruin, but Israel returns from exile, rebuilds, and carries God&#8217;s redemptive plan forward. Compare <a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a> (Assyria destroyed) and <a href="/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a> (Nineveh cut off) with <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a> (Jerusalem inhabited again).<p>&#8226; The difference is not Israel&#8217;s merit but God&#8217;s promise. He pledged, &#8220;Though I make a full end of all the nations... I will not make a full end of you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-28.htm">Jeremiah 46:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when the Lord &#8220;killed&#8221; in judgment&#8212;Jerusalem&#8217;s fall in 586 BC or the severe losses under Rome&#8212;He always left a remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>). The same passage that predicts pruning promises future fruitfulness (<a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, the Messiah bears the fatal stroke on Israel&#8217;s behalf (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>). Those who strike the covenant people and reject Christ bear their own guilt (<a href="/zechariah/12-9.htm">Zechariah 12:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7</a> contrasts God&#8217;s corrective discipline of Israel with His destructive judgment of her enemies. His blows toward His people are measured and restorative; His blows toward oppressors are final and annihilating. The verse reassures Israel&#8212;and all believers&#8212;that while God may chasten, He never abandons His covenant. The nation&#8217;s preservation, the remnant principle, and the Messiah&#8217;s redemptive work all flow from this gracious distinction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Hath he smitten him . . .</span>--The pronouns are left in the English Version somewhat obscure, but the use of capitals makes the meaning plain: "Hath <span class= "ital">He </span>(Jehovah) smitten him (Israel) as <span class= "ital">He </span>smote those that smote him; or is he slain according to the slaughter of those that are slain by Him?" A slight alteration in the last clause in the text gives, <span class= "ital">according to the slaughter of his slayers. </span>In any case the thought is that Jehovah had chastised the guilt with a leniency altogether exceptional. They had not been punished as others had been. The words admit, however, of another meaning, which is preferred by some critics, viz., that Jehovah doth not smite Israel with the smiting like that with which his (Israel's) smiters smote him--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>had not punished, as the oppressors had punished, ruthlessly and in hate, but had in His wrath remembered mercy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - THE COMING JUDGMENT UPON JUDAH A CHASTISEMENT IN WHICH MERCY IS BLENDED WITH JUSTICE. A coming judgment upon Judah has been one of the main subjects of Isaiah's prophecy from the beginning. It has been included in the catalogue of "burdens" (see <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>.). It will have to be one of the prophet's main subjects to the end of his "book." Hence he may at any time recur to it, as he does now, without special reason or excuse. In this place the special aspect under which the judgment presents itself to him is that of its merciful character, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in degree (vers. 7, 8); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in intention (ver. 9). <p>While noting this, he feels, however, bound to note also, that the judgment is, while it lasts, severe (vers. 10, 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath he smitten him</span>; etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Has God smitten Judah, as he '(God) smote Judah's smiters?" Judah's chief smiters were Assyria and Babylon. The judgments upon them would be more severe than that upon Judah. They would be destroyed; Judah would be taken captive, and restored. <span class="cmt_word">Them that are slain by him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">them that slew him</span> (so Lowth, Ewald, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne). But, to obtain this meaning, the pointing of the present text must be altered. The law of parallelism seems, however, to require the alteration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/27-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Has the LORD struck Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(mak&#183;k&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as He struck</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#601;&#183;mak&#183;ka&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article, Preposition-k &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4347.htm">Strong's 4347: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wound, carnage, pestilence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her oppressors?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Was she killed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1467;&#1490;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;ru&#183;&#7713;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2026.htm">Strong's 2026: </a> </span><span class="str2">To smite with deadly intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like those who slayed her?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;he&#183;re&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2027.htm">Strong's 2027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A slaughter</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/27-7.htm">Isaiah 27:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/27-7.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 27:7 Has he struck them as he struck (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/27-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 27:6"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 27:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 27:8"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 27:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
