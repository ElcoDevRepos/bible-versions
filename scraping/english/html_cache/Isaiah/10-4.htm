The imagery of crouching among captives suggests a position of defeat and humiliation. Historically, this reflects the Assyrian conquest, where captives were often taken away in chains. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of Israel's disobedience and reliance on foreign powers instead of God. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of exile as a result of sin, seen in the Babylonian captivity and the ultimate exile from Eden.<p><b>or fall among the slain</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the judgment, where the only alternatives are captivity or death. It reflects the historical reality of ancient warfare, where those not taken as captives were often killed. This serves as a stark warning to the Israelites about the consequences of their actions. Theologically, it points to the wages of sin being death, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, and foreshadows the ultimate judgment for sin.<p><b>Despite all this, His anger is not turned away</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continued divine displeasure despite the severe consequences already faced. It suggests that the judgment is not yet complete, and God's righteous anger remains. This reflects the covenantal relationship where God disciplines His people to bring them back to righteousness. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's patience and justice, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>His hand is still upraised</b><br>The imagery of God's hand being upraised signifies ongoing judgment and the readiness to continue executing justice. This is a common biblical metaphor for divine intervention, whether in judgment or salvation. It serves as a warning that God's discipline is not yet finished. This phrase can also be seen as a call to repentance, as God's hand, while upraised in judgment, is also capable of offering mercy, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Dropping the direct address, and passing to the third person, the prophet seems to say as with a kind of ominous "aside," "No, there is no ally, no hiding-place but this, <span class= "ital">except they bow down among the captives or fall among the slain." </span>Exile or death, that was their only alternative. When that sentence has been uttered, the doom-bell, as we have called it, "For all this <span class= "bld">. . .</span>" tolls once more. If we adopt the Authorised version we have the same fact asserted, with the suggested thought that there was a refuge to be found in God.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without me</span>. That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by <a href="/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10:4</a>), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have "his anger," "his hand." It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - "unless," "except." Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (<a href="/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3, 6</a>.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased.
