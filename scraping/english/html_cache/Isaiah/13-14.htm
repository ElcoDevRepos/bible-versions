In the ancient Near East, gazelles were common and often hunted for food, symbolizing prey that is pursued relentlessly. This imagery reflects the fear and helplessness of the people under divine judgment. The hunted gazelle represents those who are pursued by enemies or calamity, unable to find refuge. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on nations, as seen in other prophetic books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where nations are depicted as being pursued by divine wrath.<p><b>Like a sheep without a shepherd</b><br>This phrase signifies a lack of guidance and protection. In biblical times, shepherds were responsible for the safety and direction of their flocks. Without a shepherd, sheep are vulnerable to predators and prone to wandering aimlessly. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to describe people who are lost or leaderless, such as in <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a> and <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who provides guidance and protection to His followers, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>.<p><b>Each will return to his own people</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a scattering or diaspora, where individuals are driven back to their native lands. Historically, this reflects the common practice during times of conquest or disaster, where people would flee to their ancestral homes for safety. It also indicates a breakdown of the societal structures that once held diverse groups together, leading to a reversion to tribal or familial affiliations. This can be seen in the context of the Babylonian conquest, where many were exiled or fled to avoid capture.<p><b>Each will flee to his native land</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the instinctual drive for self-preservation and the search for safety in familiar surroundings. It highlights the chaos and fear that accompany divine judgment, as people abandon their current homes in search of refuge. This is reminiscent of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, where they sought freedom and safety in the Promised Land. It also parallels the end-times prophecies where people will seek refuge from impending judgment, as seen in Revelation. The return to one's native land can symbolize a return to one's roots or origins, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
