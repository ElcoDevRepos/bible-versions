It reflects the universal scope of God's plan, transcending the boundaries of Israel. This is a fulfillment of the Abrahamic promise that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also anticipates the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>&#8220;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,</b><br>The "mountain of the LORD" refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and the location of the temple. In biblical symbolism, mountains often represent places of divine revelation and encounter with God. This invitation to ascend the mountain signifies a desire for spiritual elevation and communion with God, reminiscent of Moses receiving the law on Mount Sinai (Exodus 19).<p><b>to the house of the God of Jacob.</b><br>The "house of the God of Jacob" is another term for the temple in Jerusalem, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and the descendants of Jacob (Israel). This phrase underscores the continuity of God's promises to the patriarchs and the centrality of Jerusalem as a place of worship and divine presence. It also foreshadows the eschatological vision of a new temple where God's presence dwells among His people (Ezekiel 40-48).<p><b>He will teach us His ways</b><br>This indicates a time of divine instruction and revelation, where God Himself will impart wisdom and understanding to the nations. It reflects the prophetic hope for a new covenant where God's law is written on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). This teaching is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of divine wisdom and truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>so that we may walk in His paths.&#8221;</b><br>Walking in God's paths signifies living according to His commandments and moral order. It implies a transformation of life and conduct, aligning with God's will. This is a recurring biblical theme, where obedience to God's ways leads to blessing and life (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-16.htm">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>). It also points to the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in believers, enabling them to live righteously (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>).<p><b>For the law will go forth from Zion,</b><br>Zion, another name for Jerusalem, is depicted as the source of divine law and instruction. This reflects the central role of Jerusalem in God's redemptive plan and the dissemination of His truth to the world. It anticipates the spread of the gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>), fulfilling the prophetic vision of God's word reaching all nations.<p><b>and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</b><br>The "word of the LORD" represents God's revealed truth and commandments. Jerusalem is portrayed as the epicenter of divine revelation, from which God's message of salvation and righteousness emanates. This is fulfilled in the ministry of Jesus and the early church, where the message of the kingdom began in Jerusalem and spread globally (<a href="/luke/24-47.htm">Luke 24:47</a>). It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in the new Jerusalem, where God's presence and word will be fully realized (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain_of_the_lord.htm">The Mountain of the LORD</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's holy presence and authority.

(Comp. <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a>.) The "ways" and the "paths" are the great laws of righteousness, which lead to the eternal life. The verb for "teach" is the root of the Hebrew for "law," as the "teaching" of Jehovah.<p><span class= "bld">Shall go forth the law </span>. . .--In the preaching of the Christ, in the mission of the Twelve, in the whole history of the Apostolic Church, we have, to say the least, an adequate fulfilment of the promise. The language of St. Paul, however, suggests that there may be in the future a yet more glorious mission, of which Jerusalem shall once more be the centre (<a href="/context/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">many peoples</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Shall go</span>; or, <span class="accented">set forth</span>. The prophet means to represent the nations as encouraging one another on the way. There is no jealousy among them, for the "mountain" can hold them all. <span class="cmt_word">He will teach us</span>. The nations feel their ignorance of God, and their need of "teaching." God alone can teach them concerning himself (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33, 34</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10, 11</a>); and "he will teach" them, either directly, as the Incarnate Son, or indirectly through those whom he has appointed to be "teachers" (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of his ways</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "some of his ways," not "all of them;" for at present "we know in part" only (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>), and the greater portion of his ways are "past finding out" (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). The "ways" here spoken of are, no doubt, rules for the conduct of life, which are practically inexhaustible. God, however, will teach every man, who honestly seeks to learn, enough to enable him to "walk in his paths." <span class="cmt_word">Out of Zion shall go forth the Law</span>; rather, <span class="accented">instruction</span>, or <span class="accented">teaching</span>. The word (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is without the article. The instruction intended is that of the Church of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">peoples</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
