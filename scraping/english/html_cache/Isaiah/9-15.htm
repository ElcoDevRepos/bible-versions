Elders were respected figures in society, often serving as judges or leaders within the community. They were expected to embody wisdom and integrity, guiding the people according to God's laws. This phrase highlights the importance of righteous leadership, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, where Moses is advised to appoint capable men who fear God as leaders. The "honorable man" refers to those who hold positions of respect and influence, emphasizing the responsibility of leaders to uphold truth and justice.<p><b>and the tail is the prophet who teaches lies</b><br>The "tail" represents false prophets, contrasting with the honorable leaders. In biblical times, prophets were seen as messengers of God, tasked with conveying His truth to the people. However, false prophets, as mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>, led people astray with deceitful messages. This phrase underscores the danger of false teachings and the consequences of straying from God's truth. The imagery of the "tail" suggests a position of lesser importance and integrity, warning against the influence of those who distort God's word for personal gain or to mislead others. This serves as a reminder of the need for discernment and adherence to true prophetic messages, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elder_and_honorable_man.htm">The Elder and Honorable Man</a></b><br>Represents the leaders and those in positions of authority within the society of Israel.

Instead, verse 13 of the same chapter shows they refused to return to Him, so judgment begins with their leaders (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; What the head embraces, the body follows; therefore, corrupt leadership guarantees national ruin (<a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is the elder and honorable man</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Elder and honorable&#8221; speaks of age, experience, and public esteem (<a href="/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>). God affirms that such positions are real and carry authority.<p>&#8226; Honor, however, must sit on the foundation of obedience to the Lord.

Both ends of society&#8212;civil authority and spiritual voice&#8212;had turned from truth, ensuring sweeping judgment. The verse underscores that true honor rests on faithfulness to God&#8217;s word, leadership bears heightened accountability, and false teaching devastates a people.
