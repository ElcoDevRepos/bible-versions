In the context of Isaiah, it reflects the promise of restoration and peace for Israel after the Babylonian exile. The teaching by the LORD signifies a direct and personal relationship with God, reminiscent of the covenant relationship established at Sinai. This promise is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, where Jesus refers to this prophecy, indicating that those who come to Him are taught by God. The idea of being taught by the LORD also aligns with the concept of the Holy Spirit as a teacher and guide in the lives of believers, as seen in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>.<p><b>and great will be their prosperity</b><br>The term "prosperity" here can be understood as peace, well-being, or wholeness, often translated from the Hebrew word "shalom." This prosperity is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and communal well-being. In the historical context, this promise would have been particularly comforting to the Israelites, who faced uncertainty and hardship. Theologically, it points to the ultimate peace and fulfillment found in the Messianic kingdom, where Christ reigns and brings true peace. This prosperity is also a fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to bless Abraham's descendants and make them a blessing to the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
