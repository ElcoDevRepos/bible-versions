The prophecy indicates that Sennacherib would retreat without conquering the city. Historically, this aligns with the Assyrian campaign in 701 BC, where Sennacherib's forces were halted. Theologically, it demonstrates God's sovereignty and protection over Jerusalem, fulfilling His promise to defend the city. This event is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>, emphasizing its significance in biblical history.<p><b>and he will not enter this city,</b><br>The assurance that Sennacherib would not enter Jerusalem highlights God's direct intervention. This was a miraculous deliverance, as the Assyrian army was a formidable force. Theologically, it underscores God's faithfulness to His covenant with David, as Jerusalem was the city of David. This protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and deliverer of His people. The phrase also connects to <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46</a>, which speaks of God as a refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The declaration by the LORD signifies divine authority and certainty. In the context of Isaiah, the prophetic word of the LORD is powerful and unchangeable. This phrase assures the people of Judah that the promise is not from Isaiah himself but from God. It reflects the biblical theme of God's word being trustworthy and effective, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word accomplishes what He desires. This declaration also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

The arrogant king who marched toward Jerusalem with boastful threats (<a href="/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10&#8211;13</a>) will suddenly find himself in full withdrawal. The Lord accomplished this overnight when His angel struck down 185,000 soldiers (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-21.htm">2 Chronicles 32:21</a>). What looks impossible from a human vantage point becomes certain once God speaks. Just as Pharaoh&#8217;s forces were turned back at the Red Sea, so Assyria&#8217;s pride collapses under divine intervention (<a href="/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the way he came</b><p>The retreat is not random; it follows the exact road of invasion. This mirrors the principle God voiced earlier: &#8220;I will put My hook in your nose&#8230; and I will turn you back on the way by which you came&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>). Retracing his steps highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;Assyria controls no routes except those God permits (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>). The conqueror&#8217;s march becomes a humbling walk of shame.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will not enter this city</b><p>Jerusalem remains untouched. Despite siege preparations, not a single Assyrian soldier breaches the walls (<a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>). The Lord acts as an impregnable shield, echoing <a href="/psalms/46-5.htm">Psalm 46:5</a>, &#8220;God is within her; she will not be moved.&#8221; Centuries later, Jesus weeps over Jerusalem&#8217;s future judgment (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41&#8211;44</a>), underscoring that safety is assured only while the city abides in faith. In Isaiah&#8217;s day, faith is vibrant, and God keeps His promise: &#8220;I will be a wall of fire around her&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>The phrase seals the oracle with divine authority. What the Lord declares, He performs (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). No political analysis, military might, or diplomatic maneuver can override His word. For Hezekiah, this assurance invites rest; for Sennacherib, it signals inevitable defeat. Today it still urges trust&#8212;God&#8217;s spoken promises remain immovable (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a> shows the Lord reversing an intimidating threat. The invader retreats, retraces his path, and never breaches Jerusalem, all because God said so. The verse celebrates divine faithfulness, reminds believers that no enemy can overrule God&#8217;s decree, and invites us to place unwavering confidence in His protective care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the way that he came</span>. It is clear that Sennacherib on this occasion had marched by the usual coast route, through Sharon and the Shefeleh, upon Lachish, leaving Jerusalem far to his left. From Laehish he sent Rabshakeh to Hezekiah with a threatening message, and (as our version has it) "<span class="accented">with</span> a great army;" rather, "with a strong force." Rabshakeh, having delivered his message, returned to his master (<a href="/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>), doubtless with his escort. Sennacherib then sent a letter by messengers, but without an army, so far as we are told, to renew his threats. Meanwhile from Lachish he went to Libnah, after which we know nothing of his movements, unless we accept the Egyptian account, which was, that he advanced to Pelusium. The declaration, "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return" (comp. ver. 29) was the most comforting that Hezekiah could possibly receive. It assured him that he would not even be confronted with his enemy.
