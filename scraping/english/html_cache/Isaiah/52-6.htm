Knowing God's name signifies understanding His character, authority, and presence. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented the essence of a person. God's name, often revealed as Yahweh, signifies His eternal, self-existent nature. This promise of knowing His name indicates a future time of revelation and clarity for Israel, contrasting with periods of spiritual blindness and idolatry. It also reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God declared, "I am the LORD your God" (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p><b>therefore they will know on that day</b><br>The phrase "on that day" is often used in prophetic literature to refer to a specific time of divine intervention or fulfillment of prophecy. It points to a future event when God's promises will be realized. This could be seen as a reference to the coming of the Messiah or the eschatological day of the Lord, a time of judgment and restoration. The certainty of this knowledge underscores the reliability of God's promises and His sovereign control over history.<p><b>that I am He who speaks.</b><br>This declaration affirms God's active role in communicating with His people. It echoes the divine self-identification found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>, where God asserts His unique identity and authority. The phrase "I am He" is reminiscent of God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," highlighting His unchanging nature. This assurance of God's voice contrasts with the false prophets and idols that led Israel astray, emphasizing that God alone is the true source of revelation and guidance.<p><b>Here I am!&#8221;</b><br>This exclamation signifies God's readiness to act and be present with His people. It conveys immediacy and assurance, suggesting that God is not distant or indifferent but actively involved in the lives of His people. This phrase can be seen as a precursor to the incarnation of Christ, where God physically dwelt among humanity. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to be with His people, as seen in the Emmanuel prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>) and the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>), where Jesus promises to be with His followers always.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, emphasizing His identity and presence to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_people.htm">My People (Israel)</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are being reassured of God's presence and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_revelation.htm">The Day of Revelation</a></b><br>A prophetic time when God's people will recognize and understand His true nature and His words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_knowing_god's_name.htm">The Importance of Knowing God's Name</a></b><br>Understanding God's name is crucial for a deeper relationship with Him.
