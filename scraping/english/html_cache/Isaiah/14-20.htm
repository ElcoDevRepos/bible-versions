In biblical times, burial was an important ritual, symbolizing respect and closure. The lack of burial signifies divine judgment and rejection, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>, where Jehoiakim is prophesied to have the burial of a donkey. This reflects the ultimate disgrace for a king or leader, emphasizing the severity of their actions and the resulting divine punishment.<p><b>since you have destroyed your land</b><br>The destruction of one's own land indicates a betrayal of stewardship and responsibility. In the context of Isaiah, this is directed towards the king of Babylon, who through his oppressive rule and military campaigns, brought ruin upon his own nation. This phrase highlights the consequences of pride and tyranny, as leaders are expected to protect and nurture their lands. Theologically, it underscores the principle that those who fail to care for what God has entrusted to them will face judgment, as seen in the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>.<p><b>and slaughtered your own people</b><br>This phrase points to the internal violence and oppression that characterized the reign of certain rulers. Historically, tyrannical leaders often resorted to violence to maintain power, leading to the suffering and death of their own citizens. This is a direct violation of the covenantal responsibility of kings to act justly and protect their people, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>. Theologically, it serves as a warning against the abuse of power and the moral decay that results from turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>The offspring of the wicked will never again be mentioned</b><br>This phrase signifies the complete eradication of the legacy and memory of the wicked. In biblical terms, having one's name remembered was a form of immortality and blessing, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, "The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot." Theologically, this reflects the ultimate justice of God, who ensures that the wicked do not prosper indefinitely. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of the righteous remnant, where God preserves the memory and legacy of those who are faithful to Him, while the wicked are forgotten.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_babylon.htm">The King of Babylon</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/14.htm">Isaiah 14</a>, often interpreted as a representation of prideful and oppressive rulers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A historical empire known for its wealth and power, often symbolizing human pride and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message, warning of judgment and offering hope for the faithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience of Isaiah's prophecy, who were often oppressed by foreign powers like Babylon.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offspring_of_evildoers.htm">The Offspring of Evildoers</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the legacy of those who act wickedly, emphasizing the consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride_and_oppression.htm">The Consequences of Pride and Oppression</a></b><br>The verse highlights the downfall of those who destroy and oppress, reminding us of the dangers of pride and the importance of humility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_legacy_of_righteousness_vs._wickedness.htm">The Legacy of Righteousness vs. Wickedness</a></b><br>Our actions leave a legacy.

In the Ancient Near East, burial with ancestors signified dignity and hope for one&#8217;s legacy. God denies this privilege to Babylon&#8217;s tyrant, underscoring utter humiliation. Similar language appears when Jeremiah foretells Jehoiakim&#8217;s ignoble end&#8212;&#8220;He will be buried like a donkey, dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>). <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20-21</a> echoes the same pattern: earth&#8217;s last despot is denied burial, cast alive into the lake of fire. The principle is clear&#8212;oppressors who exalt themselves above God will be publicly exposed and eternally shamed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since you have destroyed your land</b><p>This clause names the first charge: the king&#8217;s ruinous policies devastate the very soil entrusted to him. Isaiah already warned, &#8220;Woe to those who join house to house&#8230; until no space is left&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>), and Habakkuk declared that plunderers &#8220;have plotted shame for your house, cutting off many peoples and sinning against your own soul&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>). When leaders abuse power, the land itself suffers&#8212;crops fail, cities fall, and creation mourns (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>). Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>) becomes a standing testimony that the Lord defends His creation from tyrannical stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and slaughtered your own people</b><p>The second charge is bloodshed. Babylon&#8217;s king is notorious for massacring both foreigners and his subjects (cf. <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-49.htm">Jeremiah 51:49</a>). Scripture consistently ties innocent blood to divine judgment: &#8220;Surely for your lifeblood I will demand a reckoning&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). Manasseh met the same indictment&#8212;&#8220;Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>), and God allowed Judah&#8217;s exile partly for that crime (<a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). This verse reminds us that God counts every life precious; rulers who treat citizens as disposable will face His wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The offspring of the wicked will never again be mentioned</b><p>The judgment extends beyond the tyrant to his dynasty. In Scripture, cutting off a name signifies complete obliteration (<a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>). God vowed concerning Amalek, &#8220;I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>), and concerning Coniah, &#8220;Record this man as childless&#8230; no descendant of his will prosper&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>). Isaiah describes Babylon&#8217;s future: &#8220;Prepare a place to slaughter their sons for the iniquity of their fathers&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/14-21.htm">Isaiah 14:21</a>). God&#8217;s justice ensures that evil power structures end, making way for the everlasting kingdom of Christ (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/14-20.htm">Isaiah 14:20</a> delivers a sobering lesson: God publicly shames tyrants, repays environmental and social destruction, avenges innocent blood, and erases the legacy of entrenched wickedness. He reserves honor for the righteous (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>) and establishes a kingdom where justice and peace reign forever (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial . . .</span>--The curse of the dishonoured death is connected with its cause.

In the inscription of Eshmunazzar, king of Sidon (quoted by Cheyne), we have both elements of the imprecation: "Let him (the man who violates the sacredness of the king's tomb) not have a couch with the shade, and let him not be buried in the grave, and let him not have son or seed in his stead." In the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 26) and Merodach-baladan III. (<span class= "ital">ib., </span>ix. 36) we find like curses. Historically, as the <span class= "ital">Behistun </span>inscription shows, the dynasty of Nabopolassar disappeared from history. and Darius boasts of having subdued an impostor, a second Nebuchadnezzar, who claimed to represent it (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. 114). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - If we make the alteration suggested in the preceding note, this verse will begin as follows: "They that have gone down to the stoner of the pit, with these thou shalt not be joined in burial" - a repetition certainly of the first clause of ver. 19, but with amplification, and with the reason appended. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast destroyed thy land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "brought ruin on it by displeasing God, and causing him to visit it with a judgment." <span class="cmt_word">The seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall not be named forever</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/109-13.htm">Psalm 109:13</a>).
