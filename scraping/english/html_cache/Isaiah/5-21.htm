In the context of Isaiah, it is often used to pronounce divine judgment upon the people of Israel for their sins. This particular "woe" is part of a series of six woes in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>, which highlight various sins of the nation. The use of "woe" indicates the seriousness of the offense and the impending consequences.<p><b>who are wise in their own eyes</b><br>This phrase addresses the sin of pride and self-reliance. In the biblical context, wisdom is highly valued, but true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The people being addressed here are those who rely on their own understanding rather than seeking divine guidance. This self-reliance is condemned because it leads to moral and spiritual blindness. The phrase echoes <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>, "Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil."<p><b>and clever in their own sight.</b><br>The term "clever" here is synonymous with being shrewd or cunning, often with a negative connotation. It suggests a reliance on human intellect and craftiness rather than on God's wisdom. This attitude is reminiscent of the serpent's cunning in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where human wisdom led to the fall. The phrase warns against the arrogance of thinking one can navigate life successfully without God's guidance. It also connects to the New Testament, where Paul warns against being "wise in your own sight" (<a href="/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>), emphasizing humility and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Self-conceit is the antithesis of humility; and as humility is, in a certain sense, the crowning virtue, so self-conceit is a sort of finishing touch put to vice. While a man thinks humbly of himself, there is a chance that he may repent and amend.
