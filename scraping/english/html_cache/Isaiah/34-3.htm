In ancient Near Eastern culture, burial was a significant practice, and leaving bodies unburied was considered a great dishonor (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>). This imagery underscores the totality of God's wrath against sin and rebellion. The unburied dead symbolize the complete defeat and disgrace of those who oppose God. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where those who reject God face eternal separation from Him (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>).<p><b>and the stench of their corpses will rise</b><br>The rising stench signifies the magnitude of the destruction and serves as a vivid reminder of the consequences of sin. In the ancient world, the smell of decay was associated with death and corruption, emphasizing the physical and spiritual decay resulting from rebellion against God. This imagery is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/jeremiah/25-33.htm">Jeremiah 25:33</a>, where the slain are left as refuse on the ground, highlighting the pervasive nature of judgment.<p><b>the mountains will flow with their blood</b><br>This hyperbolic language illustrates the vastness of the slaughter and the overwhelming nature of divine retribution. Mountains, often seen as symbols of strength and stability, are depicted as being overwhelmed by the blood of the slain, indicating that no earthly power can withstand God's judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of the apocalyptic visions in Revelation, where blood flows as high as a horse's bridle (<a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>), symbolizing the complete and inescapable nature of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>This chapter is a prophecy against Edom, representing nations opposed to God.

The disgrace of lying exposed intensifies the shame of defeat and underscores the seriousness of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the stench of their corpses will rise</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;and the stench of their corpses will rise&#8221; adds another sense: smell. No quick cleanup, no dignified interment&#8212;only the lingering odor of decay.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/8-14.htm">Exodus 8:14</a> reports that when the frog plague ended &#8220;the land stank,&#8221; a smaller-scale warning that sin brings putrefaction.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a> foretells the northern army&#8217;s carcasses giving off &#8220;a foul smell.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a> mentions corpses left &#8220;as the stench of your camps.&#8221;<p>The rising odor is not only physical but moral, symbolizing corruption that has reached God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>).

The verse calls readers to sober reverence, trusting the One who both judges sin and offers salvation through His promised Redeemer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast out</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refused burial - thrown to the dogs and vultures (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>). Such treatment of the dead was regarded as a shame and a disgrace. It was on some occasions an intentional insult (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>); but here the idea is rather that it would be impossible to bury the slain on account of their number. In ancient times corpses often lay unburied on battle-fields (Herod., 3:12). <span class="cmt_word">The mountains shall be molted with their blood</span>. When the feelings of the prophet are excited, he shrinks from no hyperbole.
