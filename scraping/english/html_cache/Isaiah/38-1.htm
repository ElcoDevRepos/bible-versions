It refers to a period when the Assyrian Empire was a dominant threat, and Judah was under significant pressure. The phrase connects to the broader narrative of Hezekiah's reign, which is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>.<p><b>Hezekiah became mortally ill.</b><br>Hezekiah's illness is a pivotal moment in his life and reign. The nature of the illness is not specified, but it was severe enough to be life-threatening. This event tests Hezekiah's faith and reliance on God. It also serves as a backdrop for a miraculous healing, which is a testament to God's power and mercy.<p><b>The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him</b><br>Isaiah, a major prophet in the Hebrew Bible, plays a crucial role as God's messenger. His lineage, being the son of Amoz, establishes his authority and credibility. Isaiah's involvement highlights the close relationship between the prophet and the king, as well as the importance of prophetic guidance in the affairs of the nation.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>This introduction underscores the divine authority behind Isaiah's message. It is not merely Isaiah's opinion but a direct communication from God. This phrase is a common prophetic formula, emphasizing that the message is to be taken seriously as the word of the LORD.<p><b>&#8216;Put your house in order,</b><br>This command implies that Hezekiah should prepare for his impending death by settling his affairs, both personal and political. It suggests the importance of readiness and responsibility, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship over one's life and duties.<p><b>for you are about to die;</b><br>The announcement of Hezekiah's impending death is direct and unequivocal. It serves as a reminder of human mortality and the sovereignty of God over life and death. This moment of crisis becomes an opportunity for Hezekiah to seek God's intervention.<p><b>you will not recover.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The initial prognosis is grim, indicating that without divine intervention, Hezekiah's condition is terminal. This sets the stage for a dramatic turn of events, as Hezekiah's subsequent prayer and God's response demonstrate the power of faith and prayer. This phrase also foreshadows the miraculous extension of Hezekiah's life, which is a testament to God's grace and the efficacy of earnest supplication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and reforms to restore proper worship in the kingdom.

So in <a href="/isaiah/38-6.htm" title="And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.">Isaiah 38:6</a>, the deliverance of the city is spoken of as still future. Assuming the rectified chronology given above, we are carried to a time ten or eleven years before the invasion, which was probably in part caused by the ambitious schemes indicated in Isaiah 39. It follows from either view that we have no ground for assuming, as some commentators have done, (1) that the illness was an attack of the plague that destroyed the Assyrian army, or (2) that the treasures which Hezekiah showed to the Babylonian ambassadors were in part the spoil of that army.<p><span class= "bld">Set thine house in order.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Give orders to thy house, </span>euphemistic for "make thy will." The words are a striking illustration, like Jonah's announcement that Nineveh should be destroyed in three days (<a href="/jonah/3-4.htm" title="And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.">Jonah 3:4</a>), of the conditional character of prophecy. It would seem as if Isaiah had been consulted half as prophet and half as physician as to the nature of the disease. It seemed to him fatal; it was necessary to prepare for death. The words may possibly imply a certain sense of disappointment at the result of Hezekiah's reign. In the midst of the king's magnificence and prosperity there was that in the inner house of the soul, as well as in that of the outer life, which required ordering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days</span>. The illness of Hezekiah is fixed by ver. 5 (and <a href="/2_kings/20-6.htm">2 Kings 20:6</a>) to the fourteenth year of his reign, or <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>.

Prophecies were often threats, and, when such, were conditional, announcing results which would follow unless averted by prayer or repentance (compare Jonah's prophecy, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown," <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/38-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
