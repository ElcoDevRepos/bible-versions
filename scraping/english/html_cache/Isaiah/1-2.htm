It reflects the covenantal language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>, where Moses calls upon heaven and earth as witnesses against Israel. The heavens and earth are often invoked in Scripture as enduring witnesses to God's covenant with His people, emphasizing the seriousness of the message. This invocation underscores the universal scope of God's authority and the gravity of Israel's rebellion.<p><b>for the LORD has spoken:</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the authority and finality of God's word. When the LORD speaks, it is not merely a suggestion but a divine decree. This echoes the prophetic tradition where the word of the LORD is the ultimate truth and carries the weight of divine judgment or promise. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, reminding them of His faithfulness and their obligations.<p><b>&#8220;I have raised children and brought them up,</b><br>This reflects the intimate relationship between God and Israel, portraying God as a loving and nurturing parent. The imagery of raising children is common in the Old Testament, illustrating God's care and provision (<a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>). It also highlights the expectations of obedience and gratitude from the children, which in this context refers to the nation of Israel. The historical context is the period of the divided kingdom, where Israel and Judah often strayed from God's commandments.<p><b>but they have rebelled against Me.</b><br>Rebellion here signifies a deliberate and conscious turning away from God. This is not mere disobedience but a breach of the covenant relationship. The rebellion of Israel is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, often leading to calls for repentance and warnings of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/2-29.htm">Jeremiah 2:29-31</a>). This rebellion is seen as a rejection of God's authority and love, akin to a child's betrayal of a parent's trust. Theologically, it foreshadows the need for a new covenant, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks with authority and calls the heavens and earth to witness His grievance against His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic witnesses called upon by God to hear His case against Israel, emphasizing the gravity and universality of the message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children (Israel)</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, whom God has nurtured and raised, yet they have turned away from Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The act of Israel turning away from God, despite His care and provision for them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The messenger through whom God delivers His message, serving as a mouthpiece for divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_parental_care.htm">God's Parental Care</a></b><br>God is depicted as a loving parent who has raised His children with care and provision.

He wants every created thing above to recognize that what follows is not human complaint but divine indictment. Moses used the same wording when he warned Israel of covenant consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>), and the psalmist reminds us that &#8220;the heavens declare the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>). By invoking heaven as witness, Isaiah shows that God&#8217;s case is universally valid and eternally recorded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give ear, O earth</b><p>The earth joins the heavens as witness, underscoring that the message concerns every realm of creation. Isaiah is not exaggerating; covenant obedience or rebellion affects the whole order (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-18</a>; <a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>). Jeremiah echoes the same appeal: &#8220;Be appalled, O heavens, at this&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-12.htm">Jeremiah 2:12</a>), and Micah summons &#8220;the mountains&#8221; to hear the LORD&#8217;s controversy (<a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1-2</a>). God&#8217;s people may try to ignore His word, but creation listens attentively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the LORD has spoken</b><p>The summons is justified because the covenant-making, covenant-keeping LORD is speaking. His word carries absolute authority (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>) and unfailing effectiveness (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). When God speaks, prophets, kings, and commoners alike must bow (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). Isaiah is not offering personal opinion; he is transmitting the unchanging, living word of Yahweh, which remains binding today (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have raised children and brought them up</b><p>God describes Israel as His own children&#8212;evidence of intimate, gracious relationship. He &#8220;raised&#8221; and &#8220;brought them up,&#8221; language that recalls deliverance from Egypt, wilderness provision, and entrance into the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>). Like a Father, He nurtured, protected, and taught them (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>). Every festival, law, and sacrifice testified to His patient upbringing of a chosen family (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they have rebelled against Me</b><p>Tragically, the children reject the Father. Rebellion, not ignorance, is the charge. Israel knew the covenant yet chose idolatry and injustice (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5-6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). The pattern echoes the prodigal son who abandoned the father&#8217;s house (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>). Rebellion grieves God&#8217;s heart and invites discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>). Even so, <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a> shows that all humanity displays the same tendency: knowing God yet refusing Him. Isaiah&#8217;s opening verse therefore exposes sin while hinting at the need for redemption that the book will later announce.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> presents a cosmic courtroom scene. Heaven and earth are summoned because the sovereign LORD is speaking. He reminds Israel that He lovingly raised them as His own children, yet they willfully rebelled. The verse reveals God&#8217;s fatherly heart, humanity&#8217;s deep-seated defiance, and the unbreakable authority of God&#8217;s word. It calls readers in every age to listen, remember their gracious Father, and turn from rebellion to obedient trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth.</span>--The prophet opens the great indictment by calling the universe to listen to it. The words remind us of <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm" title="Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>, but the thought was the common inheritance of Hebrew poets (<a href="/psalms/50-4.htm" title="He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.">Psalm 50:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-19.htm" title="Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.">Jeremiah 6:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-29.htm" title="O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), and we can draw no inference from the parallelism as to the date of either book.<p><span class= "bld">I have nourished and brought up children. </span>The last word has in the Hebrew the emphasis of position: <span class= "ital">Sons I have reared and brought up. </span>From those who had thus grown up under a father's care filial duty might have been expected; but it was not so. The sons had rebelled against their father's control. It is significant that the prophet starts from the thought of the fatherhood of God in His relation to Israel. The people might be unworthy of their election, but He had chosen them (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - GOD'S COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</span>. "A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1, 2</a>; Aesch., 'P.

The speech of Jehovah follows in vers. 2, 3. <span class="cmt_word">I have nourished and brought up children</span>; literally, (<span class="accented">my</span>) <span class="accented">sons I have made great and high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have raised Israel to greatness and exalted him among the nations. Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his "sons." <span class="cmt_word">They have rebelled against me.</span> The verb used is generally rendered in our version "transgressed" (see <a href="/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, "revolted from me;" Gesenius, "fallen away from me;" Cheyne, "broken away from me." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Listen,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O heavens,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8064.htm">Strong's 8064: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heaven, sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and give ear,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;z&#238;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
