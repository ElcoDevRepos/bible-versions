Their proclamation of God's holiness is so powerful that it causes a physical reaction in the temple. This emphasizes the majesty and authority of God, as even the voices of His attendants have immense power. The seraphim's cry of "Holy, holy, holy" (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>) underscores the complete and perfect holiness of God, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>.<p><b>the doorposts and thresholds shook</b><br>The shaking of the doorposts and thresholds signifies the overwhelming presence and power of God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such physical manifestations were often associated with divine appearances or theophanies. This shaking can be compared to other biblical instances where God's presence causes the earth to tremble, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). It symbolizes the awe and reverence due to God and the transformative impact of His presence.<p><b>and the temple was filled with smoke</b><br>Smoke is often associated with the presence of God, as seen in the cloud that filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>) and the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). It represents God's glory and holiness, creating a barrier between the divine and the human, emphasizing the need for purification and atonement. The smoke in Isaiah's vision also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who provides the means for humanity to enter into God's holy presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

This is not poetic exaggeration but a physical reaction to divine presence, echoing events like Sinai where &#8220;the whole mountain shook violently&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and the earthquake at Jesus&#8217; resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By describing stationary, weight-bearing structures quaking, Isaiah underscores the absolute supremacy of God over what seems most stable in our world (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The shaking also foreshadows judgment: when God moves, nothing unholy can remain unmoved (<a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; <a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the temple was filled with smoke</b><p>&#8226; Smoke or cloud frequently signals God&#8217;s immediate presence and His unapproachable holiness&#8212;first in <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a> when the tabernacle was completed, later in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13-14</a> at Solomon&#8217;s temple, and finally in <a href="/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a>.<p>&#8226; The literal filling of the temple makes clear that worship is now enveloped by God Himself; Isaiah cannot escape or distance himself from holiness (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The smoke also graciously veils full glory, sparing Isaiah from instant destruction (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>), yet it compels awe, confession, and readiness for service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The seraphim&#8217;s thunderous praise shakes the temple&#8217;s very framework and floods it with smoke, vividly displaying God&#8217;s overwhelming holiness and authority.

So in <a href="/revelation/15-8.htm" title="And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.">Revelation 15:8</a>, the "smoke from the glory of God" precedes the outpouring of the seven vials of wrath'. The parallelism of the clouds of incense-smoke as the symbol of adoring prayer (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm" title="And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.">Revelation 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-4.htm" title="And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.">Revelation 8:4</a>) suggests an alternative interpretation as possible; but in that case mention would probably have been made of the censers from which it rose.
