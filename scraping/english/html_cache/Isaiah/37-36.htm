In the Old Testament, this figure sometimes appears as a pre-incarnate Christ, acting with divine authority. The phrase indicates a direct intervention by God in human affairs, emphasizing His sovereignty and ability to deliver His people. This event occurs during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah, who had prayed for deliverance from the Assyrian threat.<p><b>and struck down 185,000 men</b><br>The striking down of 185,000 Assyrian soldiers is a demonstration of God's power and judgment. This miraculous event underscores the futility of human arrogance against divine will. Historically, the Assyrian army was a formidable force, known for its military prowess and brutality. The sudden destruction of such a large number of troops would have been a significant blow to Assyrian morale and power. This act of divine intervention is reminiscent of other biblical events where God delivers His people, such as the plagues in Egypt.<p><b>in the camp of the Assyrians.</b><br>The Assyrian camp was likely located near Jerusalem, as they were besieging the city. Assyria, under King Sennacherib, was expanding its empire and had already conquered many surrounding nations. The Assyrian threat was real and imminent, making this divine intervention crucial for the survival of Judah. Archaeological evidence, such as the Taylor Prism, records Sennacherib's campaign in Judah, though it omits this defeat, highlighting the selective nature of ancient records.<p><b>When the people got up the next morning,</b><br>The phrase suggests a normal routine disrupted by an extraordinary event. The people of Jerusalem, likely expecting another day of siege, instead find themselves delivered. This timing emphasizes the suddenness and completeness of God's deliverance, occurring overnight without human intervention.<p><b>there were all the dead bodies!</b><br>The sight of the dead bodies serves as a tangible proof of God's intervention and judgment. It fulfills the prophecy given to Hezekiah that God would defend the city and save it for His own sake and for the sake of David, His servant. This event is a powerful reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant promises and His ability to protect His people against overwhelming odds. The destruction of the Assyrian army without a battle also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, achieved not through human means but through divine power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often associated with God's direct intervention.

History, as written from the modern stand-point, would dwell on the details of the pestilence. To Isaiah, who had learnt to see in the winds the messengers of God (<a href="/psalms/104-4.htm" title="Who makes his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:">Psalm 104:4</a>), it was nothing else than the "angel of the Lord." So he would have said of the wreck of the Armada, "<span class= "ital">Afflavit Deus et dissipantur inimici" </span>or of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, "He sendeth forth his ice like morsels: who is able to abide his frost" (<a href="/psalms/147-17.htm" title="He casts forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?">Psalm 147:17</a>). The Assyrian records, as might be expected, make no mention of the catastrophe, but a singular parallel is presented by the account which Herodotus gives (ii. 141), on the authority of the Egyptian priests, of the destruction of Sennacherib's army when he invaded Egypt, then under the rule of Sethon, a priest of Ptha or Hephaestos. The priest-king prayed to his gods, and the Assyrian army, then encamped before Pelusium, were attacked by myriads of field-mice, who gnawed the straps of quivers, bows, and shields, and so made all their weapons useless, and led to their taking flight. Therefore, the historian adds, there stood a statue of Sethon in the Temple of Hephaestos at Memphis, with a mouse in one hand and with the inscription, "Whosoever looks at me let him fear the gods." Some writers (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Ewald and Canon Rawlinson) have been led by this to the conclusion that the pestilence fell on Sennacherib's army at Pelusium, and not at Jerusalem. It may be questioned, however, whether, even admitting that the narrative in its present form may be later than the exile, the probabilities are not in favour of the Biblical record, compiled as it was by writers who had documents and inherited traditions, rather than of the travellers' tales which the vergers of Egyptian temples told to the good Herodotus.<p><span class= "bld">In the camp of the Assyrians</span>.--Josephus (<span class= "ital">Bell. Jud., </span>v. 7, 2) names a site in the outskirts of Jerusalem which in his time still bore this name. The narrative of Isaiah leaves room for a considerable interval between his prophecy and the dread work of the destroyer (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>). "In that night" does not necessarily imply immediate sequence, the demonstrative adjective being used, like the Latin <span class= "ital">iste, </span>or <span class= "ital">ille, </span>for "that memorable night." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the angel of the Lord went forth</span>. The parallel passage of Kings (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) has, "It came to pass <span class="accented">that night</span>, that the angel of the Lord went out." The word of Isaiah had its accomplishment within a few hours. On the camp of the Assyrians, wherever it was, whether at Libnah, or at Pelusium (Herod., 2:141), or between the two, in the dead of night, the destroying angel swooped down, and silently, without disturbance, took the lives of a hundred and eighty-five thousand' men. The camp was no doubt that in which Sennacherib commanded. It is contrary to the whole tenor of the Assyrian inscriptions to imagine that a mere <span class="accented">corps d'armee</span>, detached to threaten, not to besiege, Jerusalem, could have been one-half, or one-quarter, so numerous. It was Sennacherib's host, not the Tartan's, that was visited. So the Egyptian tradition; so ver. 37, by implication. That in later times the Jews should have transferred the scene of the slaughter to the vicinity of their own capital, as Josephus does ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. &sect; 5), is not surprising, especially as the Egyptians claimed the glory of the discomfiture for their own gods, and the completion of the victory for their own soldiers. The nature of the destruction is not, perhaps, very important, if it be allowed to have been supernatural; but the "simoom" of Prideaux and Milman, the "storm" of Vitringa and Stanley, the "nocturnal attack by Tirhakah" of Usher, Preiss, and Michaelis, and the "pestilence" of most other commentators, seem to be alike precluded by the terms of the narrative, which imply the silent death in one night of a hundred and eighty-five thousand persons by what English juries call "the visitation of God." The nearest parallel which Holy Scripture offers is the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt; but that was not, as this, without disturbance (see <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>). There a "great cry" broke the silence of the night; here it was not till morning, when men woke from their peaceful slumbers, that the discovery was made that "they were all dead corpses." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/37-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and struck down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yak&#183;keh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">185,000 men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the camp</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4264.htm">Strong's 4264: </a> </span><span class="str2">An encampment, an army</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Assyrians.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">When the people got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;k&#238;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7925.htm">Strong's 7925: </a> </span><span class="str2">To load up, to start early in the morning</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the next morning,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1242.htm">Strong's 1242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dawn, morning</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
