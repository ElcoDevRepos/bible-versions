The "sons" symbolize the inhabitants or leaders of the city. Historically, Jerusalem had many leaders and prophets, yet during times of judgment, none were able to provide true guidance. This reflects the spiritual desolation and lack of righteous leadership. The imagery of a mother and her children is common in Scripture, emphasizing the nurturing role of the city and the expected loyalty and support from its inhabitants.<p><b>there is no one to guide her</b><br>The absence of guidance indicates a period of spiritual and moral decline. In the context of Isaiah, this is a time when the people have turned away from God, resulting in a lack of divine wisdom and direction. This can be compared to the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The need for guidance underscores the importance of godly leadership, as seen in the roles of Moses, Joshua, and later, the apostles in the New Testament.<p><b>among all the sons she brought up</b><br>This phrase reiterates the previous point, emphasizing the nurturing and educational role Jerusalem played for its people. Despite being raised in a city with a rich spiritual heritage, the inhabitants failed to uphold its values. This can be seen as a parallel to the church, which is called to raise disciples who follow Christ's teachings. The failure of these "sons" to provide leadership reflects a broader theme of human inadequacy without reliance on God.<p><b>there is no one to take her hand</b><br>The imagery of taking someone's hand suggests guidance, support, and protection. In biblical times, taking someone's hand was a gesture of assistance and leadership. The absence of anyone to take Jerusalem's hand signifies a complete lack of support and direction. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ, who is often depicted as the Good Shepherd, guiding and leading His flock. The need for divine intervention is highlighted, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus, who provides the guidance and salvation that human leaders could not.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion/jerusalem.htm">Zion/Jerusalem</a></b><br>Often personified as a woman or mother in the book of Isaiah, representing the people of Israel and their spiritual state.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_zion.htm">Sons of Zion</a></b><br>Symbolic of the inhabitants of Jerusalem or the people of Israel, who are expected to provide guidance and leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to the people, calling them to repentance and offering hope for restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_godly_leadership.htm">The Need for Godly Leadership</a></b><br>The absence of guidance in Zion highlights the importance of godly leaders who can provide spiritual direction and support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_limitations_and_divine_dependence.htm">Human Limitations and Divine Dependence</a></b><br>The failure of human leaders to guide Zion underscores the necessity of relying on God, who is the ultimate guide and comforter.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_amidst_desolation.htm">God's Faithfulness Amidst Desolation</a></b><br>Even when human support is lacking, God's promises remain steadfast, offering hope and restoration to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_community_in_spiritual_guidance.htm">The Role of the Community in Spiritual Guidance</a></b><br>This passage challenges believers to step up as spiritual leaders within their communities, providing guidance and support to those in need.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_51_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 51:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_51_18_No_guide_for_Jerusalem.htm">How does Isaiah 51:18 highlight the absence of guidance for Jerusalem's people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leadership_lessons_from_Isaiah_51_18.htm">What lessons can we learn about leadership from Isaiah 51:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_51_18_Proverbs_11_14_link.htm">How does Isaiah 51:18 connect with Proverbs 11:14 on the need for guidance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_support_the_unguided_today.htm">In what ways can we provide support to those lacking guidance today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_51_18_Seek_God_s_wisdom.htm">How can Isaiah 51:18 inspire us to seek God's wisdom in leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_51_18_God_s_guidance_role.htm">What does Isaiah 51:18 reveal about God's role in guiding His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_51_18_Israel_s_disobedience.htm">How does Isaiah 51:18 reflect the consequences of Israel's disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Israel_unguided_in_Isaiah_51_18.htm">Why is there no one to guide Israel in Isaiah 51:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_51.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_brokenness.htm">What does the Bible say about being broken?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_money_the_solution_to_everything.htm">What is the purpose of prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/key_events_in_acts.htm">What are the key events in the Book of Acts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_value_the_lost_and_found.htm">How does God value the lost and found?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 51:18 Mean</div><b>Among all the sons she bore</b><p>&#8220;Among all the sons she bore&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/51-18.htm">Isaiah 51:18</a>)<p>&#8226; God pictures Jerusalem as a mother who once teemed with children&#8212;citizens who shared covenant privileges (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>).<p>&#8226; These &#8220;sons&#8221; were literally the people of Judah, not a poetic abstraction.

The city, no doubt, suffered by this state of things, becoming more ruined and more desolate than it would have been otherwise. Had Johanan and the Jews under him remained in the land, God had promised to "build them, and not pull them down;" to "plant them, and not pluck them up" (<a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10</a>). Thus Jerusalem's extreme desolation was not wholly the result of the Babylonian conquest, but was partly due to the after-misconduct of the Jews left in the country. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/51-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Among all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
