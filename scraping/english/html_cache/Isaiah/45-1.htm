This highlights God's sovereignty in using a Gentile ruler to fulfill His purposes. Historically, Cyrus is known for his decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). This designation as "anointed" prefigures the ultimate Anointed One, Jesus Christ, who brings deliverance and restoration.<p><b>whose right hand I have grasped</b><br>The imagery of God grasping Cyrus's right hand signifies divine empowerment and guidance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the right hand symbolizes strength and authority. This phrase indicates that Cyrus's success is not due to his own power but is orchestrated by God. It reflects the biblical theme of God directing the hearts of kings (<a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><b>to subdue nations before him</b><br>Cyrus's conquests, including the defeat of the Babylonian Empire, were part of God's plan to discipline and restore His people. Historically, Cyrus's military campaigns expanded the Persian Empire significantly. This subduing of nations is a fulfillment of God's promise to use Cyrus as an instrument of His will, demonstrating God's control over world events.<p><b>to disarm kings</b><br>The disarming of kings refers to the ease with which Cyrus conquered other rulers, often without significant resistance. This can be seen in the historical account of the fall of Babylon, where Cyrus's forces entered the city with minimal conflict. It underscores the theme of divine intervention, where God prepares the way for His chosen instruments.<p><b>to open the doors before him</b><br>This phrase suggests the removal of obstacles and the granting of access, both literally and metaphorically. Historically, the gates of Babylon were left open, allowing Cyrus's forces to enter the city. Spiritually, it signifies God's ability to open doors of opportunity and blessing for His purposes, a theme echoed in <a href="/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>.<p><b>so that the gates will not be shut</b><br>The assurance that the gates will not be shut emphasizes the certainty and permanence of God's plan. In the context of Cyrus's conquests, it reflects the unstoppable nature of his divinely appointed mission. This imagery also points to the ultimate victory and open access provided through Christ, who opens the way to salvation and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cyrus.htm">Cyrus</a></b><br>The Persian king whom God anointed to fulfill His purposes.

This direct address of God to a heathen king is without a parallel in Scripture. Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Abimelech, were warned through dreams. Nebuchadnezzar was even promised Divine aid (<a href="/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24, 25</a>). But no heathen monarch had previously been personally addressed by God, much less called "his anointed," and spoken to <span class="accented">by his name</span> (ver. 4). Three motives are mentioned for this special favour to him: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he might acknowledge Jehovah to be the true God; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Israel might be benefited and advantaged by him; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the attention of the whole world might be attracted, and the unity of God made manifest far and wide (vers. 3-6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord to his anointed</span>. The "anointed of Jehovah" is elsewhere always either an Israelite king, or the expected Deliverer of the nation, "Messiah the Prince" (<a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>). This Deliverer, however, was to be of the line of David (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), and of the city of Bethlehem (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), so that we can scarcely suppose Isaiah to have seen him in Cyrus. But he may have seen in Cyrus a type of the great Deliverer, as he saw in the release of Israel from the power of Babylon a type of their deliverance from sin. <span class="cmt_word">Whose right hand I have holden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">strengthened</span> (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To subdue nations before him</span> (see above, <a href="/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). Among the nations subdued by Cyrus may be mentioned the Medes, the Babylonians, the Lydians, the Caftans, the Caunians, the Lycians, the Bactrians, the Sacae, the Parthians, the Hyrcanians, the Chorasmians, the Sogdians, the Arians of Herat, the Zarangians, the Arachosians, the Satagydians, and the Gandarians. <span class="cmt_word">I will loose the loins of kings</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. render them weak and incapable of resistance" (comp. <a href="/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>), net "disarm them" (Cheyne); for the chief royal weapons were the spear and the bow, neither of which was carried at the girdle. To open before him the two-leaved gates. The cities and forts repro-sented on the Assyrian monuments have invariably their gateways closed by two large gates or doors which meet in the centre of the gateway. The bronze plating found at Ballarat gave the dimensions, and showed the strength of such gates ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archseol.,' vol. 7. pp. 83-88). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/45-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Cyrus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;w&#183;re&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
