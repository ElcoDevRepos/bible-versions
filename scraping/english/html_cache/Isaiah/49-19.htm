Historically, the Babylonian conquest led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, leaving the city in ruins. The desolation signifies both physical destruction and spiritual desolation due to the people's separation from God. This imagery is often used in prophetic literature to describe the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the resulting judgment.<p><b>and your ravaged land</b><br>The land of Israel, once flowing with milk and honey, was left barren and devastated by foreign invaders. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to the land being ravaged by enemies. The term "ravaged" emphasizes the thoroughness of the destruction, affecting agriculture, economy, and the social fabric of the nation.<p><b>will now indeed be too small for your people</b><br>This phrase prophesies a future restoration and growth of the nation. Despite the current desolation, there is a promise of return and increase. This is consistent with the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. The imagery of the land being "too small" suggests an overflow of blessings and a reversal of the previous desolation.<p><b>and those who devoured you will be far away</b><br>This indicates a divine intervention where enemies who once oppressed Israel will no longer pose a threat. The term "devoured" suggests complete consumption and destruction by foreign powers, such as Babylon. The promise that these enemies will be "far away" signifies peace and security, aligning with prophecies of a future messianic kingdom where God will protect His people. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings ultimate peace and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
