The "tenth" can be seen as a tithe, symbolizing a small, faithful group that remains after divine judgment. This remnant theme is echoed in passages like <a href="/amos/5-3.htm">Amos 5:3</a> and <a href="/zechariah/13-8.htm">Zechariah 13:8-9</a>, where a fraction of the population survives to continue God's covenant. Historically, this reflects the survival of a faithful group during the Babylonian exile, maintaining the continuity of Israel's identity and faith.<p><b>it will be burned again</b><br>The imagery of burning indicates further purification and judgment. Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of purification and judgment (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). This suggests that even the remnant will undergo further trials to refine and purify them. Historically, this can be linked to the repeated invasions and hardships faced by Israel, which served to purify and strengthen the faith of the people.<p><b>As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled</b><br>The terebinth and oak are strong, resilient trees common in the region, symbolizing endurance and longevity. When these trees are cut down, their stumps remain, suggesting that life can spring forth again. This imagery is used to convey hope and the potential for renewal. In biblical symbolism, trees often represent nations or people (<a href="/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10-12</a>), and the stump signifies the enduring promise of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>so the holy seed will be a stump in the land</b><br>The "holy seed" refers to the faithful remnant that will survive and eventually lead to the restoration of Israel. This concept is prophetic, pointing to the future coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "seed" (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). The stump symbolizes the continuity of God's promise and the eventual flourishing of His people. This imagery is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Jesus is seen as the shoot from the stump of Jesse (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), bringing salvation and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who received the vision and message from God.
