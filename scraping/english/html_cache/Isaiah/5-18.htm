The imagery of "drawing iniquity with cords of deceit" suggests a deliberate and persistent effort to engage in sinful behavior. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, cords and ropes were common tools for labor, symbolizing the intentional and laborious nature of their sin. The deceit mentioned here indicates a willful manipulation of truth, reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This phrase warns against the entanglement in sin that is self-imposed and self-deceptive, echoing the themes of self-deception found in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, where the heart is described as deceitful above all things.<p><b>and pull sin along with cart ropes</b><br>The use of "cart ropes" intensifies the imagery, suggesting a heavy burden of sin being dragged along. This reflects the idea that sin, once embraced, becomes a weighty and consuming force in one's life. In the historical context, carts were used for transporting goods, indicating that the people are not only engaging in sin but are also transporting it, spreading its influence. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which advises believers to lay aside every weight and sin that clings so closely. The phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the effort required to maintain it, contrasting with the freedom offered through repentance and faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Evil-doers are thought of as harnessing themselves as to the chariot of sin. The "cords of vanity"--i.e., of <span class= "ital">emptiness </span>or ungodliness--are the habits by which they are thus bound. The "cart ropes," thicker and stronger than the "cords," represent the extreme stage, when such habits become irresistibly dominant. Probably the words may point to some idolatrous procession, in which the chariot of Baal or Ashtaroth was thus drawn by their worshippers, like that of Demeter or Cybele in Greece, or Juggernath in India.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them</span>, etc. We come here to <span class="accented">the third woe</span>, which is pronounced against those who openly pile up sin upon sin, and scoff at God.
