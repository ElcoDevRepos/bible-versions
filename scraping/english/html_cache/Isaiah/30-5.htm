In the context of <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>, the people of Judah sought help from Egypt against the Assyrian threat, ignoring God's warnings. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on worldly powers leads to disappointment and shame (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>). The shame here is both personal and national, as turning away from God results in public disgrace.<p><b>because of a people useless to them</b><br>Egypt, the nation Judah turned to for help, is described as "useless." Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, but in this instance, it was unable to provide the necessary support. This underscores the futility of trusting in human strength over divine power. The Bible often contrasts the reliability of God with the unreliability of human allies (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>). Egypt's inability to assist Judah serves as a reminder of the limitations of earthly powers.<p><b>They bring neither help nor benefit</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ineffectiveness of Egypt's support. Despite Judah's expectations, Egypt could not deliver any tangible assistance. This mirrors other biblical narratives where reliance on foreign powers leads to failure (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>). The lack of help or benefit from Egypt serves as a cautionary tale about misplaced trust and the importance of seeking God's guidance and provision.<p><b>but only shame and disgrace.&#8221;</b><br>The outcome of Judah's alliance with Egypt is not just shame but also disgrace. This reflects the deeper spiritual and moral failure of turning away from God. The disgrace is not only a result of military failure but also a spiritual consequence of disobedience. This aligns with the biblical principle that true honor and security come from faithfulness to God (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The dual mention of shame and disgrace underscores the severity of the consequences when God's people forsake His counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which sought alliances with foreign nations like Egypt instead of relying on God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful nation at the time, often seen as a potential ally by smaller nations like Judah, but ultimately unable to provide the help and security they promised.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to Judah, warning them against relying on Egypt and urging them to trust in the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during Isaiah's time, who faced the temptation to seek help from Egypt against Assyrian threats.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire threatening Judah, prompting the temptation to seek alliances with other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_misplaced_trust.htm">The Futility of Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>Trusting in human alliances or worldly powers instead of God leads to disappointment and shame.

Instead of turning to the LORD, they dart south to Egypt. The prophet&#8217;s verdict is sweeping: &#8220;everyone&#8221; involved in that misplaced alliance will end up embarrassed.<p>- Earlier in the chapter the LORD warns, &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s protection will become your shame, and refuge in the shadow of Egypt your disgrace&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a>). Shame follows any plan that sidelines God.<p>- The pattern is consistent across Scripture: idols and human strategies disappoint. Compare <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a>&#8212;&#8220;It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man&#8230; princes.&#8221; When we bank on flesh instead of the Almighty, humiliation is inevitable (<a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of a people useless to them</b><p>- &#8220;A people&#8221; points to Egypt, Judah&#8217;s hoped-for ally. To God&#8217;s people, Egypt looked strong&#8212;armies, horses, chariots. To God, that &#8220;people&#8221; was spiritually bankrupt and therefore &#8220;useless.&#8221;<p>- Isaiah has already pictured Egypt as a cracked reed: &#8220;When they leaned on you, you shattered&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>). Judah is repeating history; generations earlier, Israel &#8220;was dismayed and ashamed because of Cush, their hope, and Egypt, their boast&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5</a>).<p>- The takeaway: any relationship that pulls us away from wholehearted trust in the LORD ultimately serves no purpose but pain (<a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They bring neither help nor benefit</b><p>- Human alliances may look profitable on parchment, yet God says they deliver &#8220;neither help nor benefit.&#8221; David learned that lesson on the battlefield: &#8220;Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/60-11.htm">Psalm 60:11</a>).<p>- Notice the doubling&#8212;help and benefit&#8212;both denied. No military victory, no economic gain, no spiritual refreshment will flow from this union. The LORD is the only fountain of real assistance (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-5</a>).<p>- Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Diplomatic strength is hollow without divine blessing.<p>&#8226; Material resources cannot substitute for God&#8217;s favor.<p>&#8226; Spiritual vitality shrivels when we outsource trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But only shame and disgrace</b><p>- The verse closes with a stark reversal: instead of deliverance, Judah will reap &#8220;only shame and disgrace.&#8221; Idolatry and self-reliance don&#8217;t yield neutral outcomes; they boomerang.<p>- Isaiah echoes this later: &#8220;They will all be put to shame and disgraced; the makers of idols will depart together in disgrace&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>).<p>- Jeremiah underscores the same principle: &#8220;The LORD has rejected those in whom you trust&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-37.htm">Jeremiah 2:37</a>). When God rejects, dishonor follows.<p>- For the believing reader today, the warning is positive as well: honor, help, and true benefit are secured by clinging to the LORD alone (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a> is God&#8217;s blunt assessment of Judah&#8217;s rush to lean on Egypt: every participant in that alliance will be humiliated because the partner they chose is powerless to save. Human aid, stripped of God&#8217;s sanction, offers no help or benefit&#8212;only compounded shame. The verse invites us to anchor our confidence exclusively in the LORD, who never fails those who trust in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They were all ashamed . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">are: </span>historic present, as before. The prophet paints the dreary disappointment of the embassy. They found Egypt at once weak and false, without the will or power to help them. So Rabshakeh compares that power to a "broken reed," which does but pierce the hand of him who leans on it. So Sargon (Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyrian Canon, </span>p. 133, quoted by Cheyne), describing the resistance of his foes, says that they <span class= "ital">"</span>carried presents, seeking his alliance, to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, a monarch who could not help them."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were all ashamed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all are ashamed</span>. The reference is not to the ambassadors, who felt no shame in their embassy, and probably returned elated by the promises made them; but to the subsequent feelings of the Jewish nation, when it was discovered by sad experience that no reliance was to be placed on "the strength of Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">A people that could not profit</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. Mr. Cheyne compares, very pertinently, an inscription of Sargon's, where he says of the people of Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, that "they and their evil chiefs, to fight against me, unto Pharaoh, King of Egypt, <span class="accented">a monarch who could not save them</span>, their presents carried, and besought his alliance" (G.
