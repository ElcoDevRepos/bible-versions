The "spirit" here can be understood as an influence or inclination that God places within the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where God influences the hearts and minds of leaders, such as Pharaoh in Exodus. It underscores the belief that God can direct the course of history according to His will.<p><b>so that he will hear a rumor</b><br>The "rumor" refers to a report or news that will cause Sennacherib to change his plans. In the historical context, this could relate to political or military developments that would distract or alarm him. This demonstrates how God uses ordinary events to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other biblical narratives where God orchestrates events through seemingly natural means.<p><b>and return to his own land</b><br>This phrase signifies the retreat of Sennacherib from his campaign against Judah. Historically, this aligns with Assyrian records that suggest Sennacherib faced challenges elsewhere, prompting his return. It highlights God's protection over Jerusalem and His ability to deliver His people without them having to engage in battle, reminiscent of other divine deliverances in Israel's history.<p><b>where I will cause him to fall by the sword.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy foretells the eventual demise of Sennacherib, which is fulfilled in his assassination by his own sons, as recorded in <a href="/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a> and <a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>. This outcome serves as a testament to God's justice and the fulfillment of His word.
