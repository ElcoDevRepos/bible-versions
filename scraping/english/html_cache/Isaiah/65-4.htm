Graves were considered unclean places (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>), and sitting among them indicates a deliberate engagement with impurity. This behavior reflects a departure from the covenantal relationship with God, as the Israelites were called to be separate from pagan practices. The imagery of graves also symbolizes spiritual death and separation from God, contrasting with the life and purity expected of God's people.<p><b>spending nights in secret places</b><br>This phrase implies engaging in occult practices or idolatrous rituals conducted under the cover of darkness. Such activities were often associated with pagan worship, which included secretive rites and ceremonies. The secrecy suggests a willful rebellion against God's commandments, as these actions were hidden from the community but not from God. The Bible frequently contrasts light and darkness, with darkness symbolizing sin and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). This behavior indicates a preference for darkness over the light of God's truth.<p><b>eating the meat of pigs</b><br>Pigs were considered unclean animals according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7-8</a>). Consuming pork was a direct violation of dietary laws given to the Israelites, symbolizing a rejection of God's holiness standards. This act represents a broader disregard for God's commandments and a willingness to adopt Gentile practices. The consumption of unclean food is often used metaphorically in Scripture to illustrate spiritual defilement and rebellion against God (<a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>). It highlights the people's choice to satisfy their desires over obedience to God.<p><b>and polluted broth from their bowls</b><br>This phrase suggests the consumption of ritually impure food, further emphasizing the theme of defilement. The term "polluted" indicates a violation of purity laws, which were central to maintaining a right relationship with God. The use of "bowls" may imply participation in idolatrous feasts or rituals, where such food was offered to idols. This behavior reflects a syncretism, blending pagan practices with the worship of Yahweh, which was condemned throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). It underscores the spiritual corruption and apostasy of the people, who have turned away from God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

God had already forbidden necromancy: &#8220;There shall not be found among you&#8230;a medium or a spiritist or one who consults the dead&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-11</a>).<p>- By choosing tombs over the living presence of God, Judah mirrored the demoniac who &#8220;lived among the tombs&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-2.htm">Mark 5:2-3</a>), illustrating bondage rather than freedom.<p>- The practice was a public rejection of God&#8217;s commands and a blatant embrace of darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spending nights in secret places</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;spending nights in secret places&#8221; hints at clandestine rituals done under cover of darkness (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).<p>- Isaiah&#8217;s contemporaries likely crept into caves or shrines to perform forbidden rites, echoing Saul&#8217;s midnight visit to the medium at Endor (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-8</a>) and the hidden idolatry Ezekiel later saw: elders worshiping images &#8220;in the dark&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7-12</a>).<p>- The secrecy underscores willful rebellion; rather than worshiping God in the light of His temple, they preferred concealed, mystical experiences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eating the meat of pigs</b><p>- God&#8217;s law was clear: &#8220;the pig&#8230;is unclean for you&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). Yet these people openly consumed what was forbidden.<p>- Pig-eating became shorthand for defiant disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>) and a sign of assimilation into pagan worship where pork was common on idolatrous altars.<p>- Their appetite showed their heart: they valued cultural convenience over covenant loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Polluted broth from their bowls</b><p>- The &#8220;polluted broth&#8221; refers to soup or juice left after boiling unclean flesh, ceremonially contaminating all who drank it (<a href="/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>).<p>- Holding it &#8220;in their bowls&#8221; captures the image of savoring what God called abominable, much like those who &#8220;drink wine in the house of their god&#8221; (<a href="/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>).<p>- Instead of the pure offerings God desired (<a href="/leviticus/7-19.htm">Leviticus 7:19-21</a>), they delighted in corrupted fare, flaunting impurity as though it were a feast.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a> exposes a people who intentionally toyed with death, secrecy, and uncleanness&#8212;sitting among graves, hiding in dark places, relishing pork, and slurping defiled stew.

His faithful are called to reject the darkness, choose purity, and live openly in His light.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/65.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Which remain among the graves.</span>--Probably the rock graves of Palestine, which, although they were ceremonially unclean, were not unfrequently used as dwellings (<a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>; <a href="/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:">Mark 5:3</a>). The charge may be one merely of neglecting the precepts of the Law, but possibly also may imply that the graves were frequented, as in <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm" title="And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.">Isaiah 29:4</a>, for necromantic purposes.<p><span class= "bld">Lodge in the monuments . . .</span>--Here, again, the words probably point to practices more or less idolatrous, and common among the heathen of the time.

It may be noted, as against the view that the verse points to the practices of the Babylonian exiles, that no reference to swine has been found in any cuneiform inscriptions. In Egypt, as in Palestine, it was looked upon as unclean (Herod. ii. 47, 48). On the worship of Thammuz, see an article by the Rev. A. H.

Not in mere defiance of the Law, but in sacrificial meals (<a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>) of which swine's flesh formed a part. Swine were sacrificial animals in Egypt (Herod., 2:47, 48), in Phoenicia (Lucian, 'De Dea Syra,' &sect; 54), and with the Greeks and Romans. They do not appear to have been employed for the purpose either by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. It was probably in Palestine that the Jews had eaten "swine's flesh," at sacrifices to Baal or Astarte (Ashtoreth). In later times to do so was regarded as one of the worst abominations (1 Macc. 1:41-64; 2 Macc, 6. and 7.). <span class="cmt_word">Broth of abominable things</span>. Either broth made from swine's flesh, or from the flesh of other unclean animals, as the hare and rabbit (<a href="/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5, 6</a>), or perhaps simply broth made from the flesh of any animals that had been offered to idols (<a href="/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/65-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">sitting</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
