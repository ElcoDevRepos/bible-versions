His story begins in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>, where God calls him to leave his homeland and promises to make him a great nation. Abraham's faith and obedience are highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-12</a>, where he is commended for trusting God's promises despite not seeing their fulfillment in his lifetime. This phrase encourages the Israelites to remember their spiritual heritage and the faith of their forefather, who trusted God against all odds.<p><b>and to Sarah who gave you birth</b><br>Sarah, Abraham's wife, is a key figure in the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. Despite her initial barrenness, God miraculously enabled her to conceive Isaac, as recounted in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. This event is a testament to God's power and faithfulness, serving as a reminder that God's promises often come to fruition in unexpected ways. Sarah's story is also referenced in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where Paul uses her as an allegory for the new covenant of grace.<p><b>When I called him, he was but one</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the humble beginnings of Abraham. When God called him, he was a solitary individual without a nation or descendants. This highlights the miraculous nature of God's work in transforming Abraham into the father of many nations. It underscores the theme of divine election and grace, where God chooses and uses the seemingly insignificant to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>.<p><b>then I blessed him and multiplied him</b><br>God's blessing on Abraham is a central theme in the biblical narrative. The promise of multiplication is first given in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a> and reiterated in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God tells Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars. This multiplication is both physical, through the nation of Israel, and spiritual, as all believers are considered Abraham's offspring through faith (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>). This phrase also points to the fulfillment of God's covenant promises, demonstrating His faithfulness and sovereignty in history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Known as the father of faith, Abraham is a central figure in the Bible. God called him to leave his homeland and promised to make him a great nation, despite his old age and initial childlessness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham, Sarah is significant for her role in the fulfillment of God's promise. She gave birth to Isaac in her old age, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_call.htm">God's Call</a></b><br>The event of God calling Abraham is pivotal. It marks the beginning of the covenant relationship between God and Abraham's descendants, which is foundational to the account of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Abraham and Sarah's account is a testament to the power of faith. Despite their circumstances, they trusted in God's promises, which encourages us to have faith even when situations seem impossible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_timing.htm">God's Sovereignty and Timing</a></b><br>God's timing is perfect, as seen in the birth of Isaac. We are reminded to trust in God's plan and timing, even when it doesn't align with our own expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_one.htm">The Power of One</a></b><br>God can use a single individual to bring about great change. Abraham was one man, yet through him, God established a nation. This encourages us to be open to God's calling, knowing He can use us mightily.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faith.htm">Legacy of Faith</a></b><br>Abraham and Sarah's faith left a legacy that impacted generations.
