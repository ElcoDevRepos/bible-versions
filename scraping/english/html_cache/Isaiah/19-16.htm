In the context of Isaiah, it points to a specific period when God will act decisively. This is a common prophetic expression found throughout the Old Testament, indicating a time when God's purposes will be fulfilled.<p><b>the Egyptians will be like women</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, this phrase implies vulnerability and fear, as women were often seen as less physically powerful in times of conflict. This metaphor highlights the reversal of Egypt's status from a powerful nation to one that is defenseless and afraid. Historically, Egypt was a dominant power, but this prophecy foretells a time of weakness.<p><b>They will tremble with fear</b><br>This indicates a profound sense of terror and helplessness. The imagery suggests a complete loss of confidence and security. The trembling is a response to the overwhelming power of God, which is a common theme in prophetic literature, where nations are often depicted as powerless before the divine will.<p><b>beneath the uplifted hand of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The "uplifted hand" symbolizes God's power and readiness to act in judgment. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority over all heavenly and earthly armies. This imagery is used throughout the Bible to convey God's might and the certainty of His actions.<p><b>when He brandishes it against them</b><br>The act of brandishing suggests a threat of imminent action. It conveys the idea of God preparing to strike, underscoring the seriousness of the impending judgment. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to execute justice against nations that oppose His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians.htm">Egyptians</a></b><br>The people of Egypt, representing a powerful nation often in opposition to Israel in biblical history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_uplifted_hand.htm">The Uplifted Hand</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and judgment, often used to describe His intervention in human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fear_of_the_lord.htm">The Fear of the LORD</a></b><br>The fear of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing reverence and awe.

His plans and purposes extend beyond any single nation, and His will is ultimately accomplished.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>While this passage speaks of judgment, it is important to remember that God's judgments are often a call to repentance and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>The imagery of God's uplifted hand serves as a reminder of His omnipotence.
