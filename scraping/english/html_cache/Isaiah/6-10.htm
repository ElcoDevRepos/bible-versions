The hardening of hearts is a recurring theme in the Bible, often indicating a judicial act of God in response to human obstinacy. In Exodus, Pharaoh's heart was hardened as a demonstration of God's power and sovereignty (<a href="/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>). Similarly, in the New Testament, Paul speaks of a hardening that has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>). This hardening serves as both a consequence of sin and a means to fulfill God's redemptive purposes.<p><b>deafen their ears and close their eyes.</b><br>This imagery of sensory impairment symbolizes spiritual insensitivity and unresponsiveness to God's message. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hearing and seeing were often associated with understanding and obedience. The prophets frequently used these metaphors to describe the people's failure to heed God's word (<a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>). Jesus also referenced this passage in the Gospels to explain why He spoke in parables, indicating that the people's spiritual blindness prevented them from grasping the truth (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>).<p><b>Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears,</b><br>This conditional statement underscores the potential for repentance and restoration if the people were to perceive and understand God's message. The possibility of seeing and hearing implies that the current state of spiritual blindness is not irreversible. Throughout Scripture, God consistently calls His people to repentance, offering forgiveness and healing to those who turn back to Him (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). The use of sensory language here highlights the importance of spiritual perception in the process of conversion.<p><b>understand with their hearts,</b><br>Understanding with the heart signifies a deep, internal comprehension that goes beyond mere intellectual assent. In Hebrew thought, the heart is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. True understanding involves a transformation of the heart, leading to genuine repentance and faith. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul prays for the Ephesians to have the eyes of their hearts enlightened (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>). The transformation of the heart is a key aspect of the new covenant, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>and turn and be healed.&#8221;</b><br>The call to "turn" is a call to repentance, a fundamental theme in the prophetic literature. Repentance involves a change of direction, turning away from sin and towards God. The promise of healing indicates not only physical restoration but also spiritual renewal and reconciliation with God. This healing is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who came to heal the brokenhearted and restore the relationship between God and humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). The prophetic message of Isaiah points forward to the redemptive work of Christ, who offers healing and salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of both judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often warned by prophets like Isaiah about impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who commissions Isaiah to deliver a message that will harden the hearts of the people as a form of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Isaiah's prophecy, who are at risk of becoming spiritually insensitive due to their persistent rebellion against God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_isaiah.htm">The Vision of Isaiah</a></b><br>The event in which Isaiah sees the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and receives his prophetic commission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god_in_judgment.htm">The Sovereignty of God in Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign in His decisions to harden or soften hearts.

Hardening is both consequence and judgment: the people choose rebellion, and God ratifies that choice (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this does not contradict God&#8217;s mercy;

The verse shows both the sobering reality of divine judicial hardening and the hope that, after discipline, those who finally see, hear, and understand will turn and receive the healing God still longs to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Make the heart of this people fat.</span>--The thought is the same as that of the "hardening" of Pharaoh's heart (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>, &c) and that of Sihon (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-30.htm" title="But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as appears this day.">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>).
