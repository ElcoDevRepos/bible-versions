"Shihor" is often identified with the eastern branch of the Nile River, indicating the region of Egypt. The grain from Shihor symbolizes the agricultural wealth of Egypt, a major supplier of grain in the ancient world. The "great waters" highlight the importance of maritime trade routes that connected various civilizations. This trade was crucial for the prosperity of cities like Tyre, which relied on importing goods to maintain its economic power.<p><b>the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre;</b><br>The Nile River was the lifeblood of Egypt, providing fertile soil and abundant harvests. The phrase underscores the economic interdependence between Egypt and Tyre. Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city, was known for its extensive trade networks and served as a hub for distributing Egyptian grain to other regions. This relationship illustrates the interconnectedness of ancient economies and the reliance of Tyre on foreign resources for its wealth. The mention of "revenue" indicates the significant profit Tyre gained from this trade, emphasizing its role as a major commercial center.<p><b>she was the merchant of the nations.</b><br>Tyre's identity as "the merchant of the nations" highlights its status as a leading trading power in the ancient world. The city was renowned for its skilled merchants and extensive trade networks that spanned the Mediterranean and beyond. Tyre's influence extended through its colonies and trade partnerships, making it a central player in the exchange of goods, culture, and ideas. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of the rise and fall of powerful nations, as Tyre's wealth and influence were ultimately subject to divine judgment. The city's role as a merchant can be seen as a type of the worldly systems that prioritize material wealth over spiritual values, contrasting with the eternal kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade.

God&#8217;s word is underscoring Tyre&#8217;s strategic location and dependence on maritime routes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came the grain of Shihor</b><p>&#8220;Shihor&#8221; points to the eastern branch of the Nile near Egypt&#8217;s border. <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a> links the same river with Egypt&#8217;s resources, asking Israel, &#8220;What have you gained by going to Egypt to drink the waters of Shihor?&#8221; Think of barges laden with sacks of grain moving north along the coast. Tyre didn&#8217;t farm that grain; it funneled it. The text stresses the literal arrival of Egyptian produce into Tyrian warehouses, fulfilling <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>&#8217;s mention of &#8220;the Shihor on the east of Egypt.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The harvest of the Nile</b><p>Egypt&#8217;s harvest was legendary. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a> contrasts the fertile Nile valley with Israel&#8217;s land; <a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56-57</a> shows nations flocking to Egypt for food during famine. That same abundance is in view here. God uses the imagery to highlight how much of Tyre&#8217;s prosperity rested on someone else&#8217;s fields&#8212;specifically, the &#8220;harvest of the Nile.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was the revenue of Tyre</b><p>All that grain translated into cash for Tyre. <a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a> lists &#8220;wheat from Minnith and flour&#8221; among the goods Tyre sold. The city thrived as a middleman: buying low, selling high, taxing every transfer. <a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-15</a> later echoes this pattern when it speaks of merchants weeping over a fallen commercial power. Isaiah&#8217;s line tells us plainly that Tyre&#8217;s ledgers were written in Egyptian grain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She was the merchant of the nations</b><p>Tyre wasn&#8217;t satisfied with local trade; she aimed for global reach. Isaiah&#8217;s wording recalls <a href="/ezekiel/27-33.htm">Ezekiel 27:33</a>, &#8220;When your wares went out to sea, you satisfied many nations.&#8221; From Spain&#8217;s silver to Arabia&#8217;s spices, Tyre brokered it all. In doing so she became the archetype of worldly commerce&#8212;so much so that <a href="/bsb/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a> picks up the same language for the end-times Babylon, whose merchants mourn her fall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a> pictures Tyre as the bustling hub of Mediterranean trade. Ships bring Egyptian grain (&#8220;the grain of Shihor,&#8221; &#8220;the harvest of the Nile&#8221;) straight to her harbors. Tyre converts that incoming produce into massive profit, earning the title &#8220;merchant of the nations.&#8221; The verse reminds us that earthly prosperity often rests on fragile foundations; God alone controls the seas, the harvest, and the fortunes of every nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">By great waters the seed of Sihor . . .</span>--Sihor ("the dark river") is as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm" title="And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what have you to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, a Hebrew name for the Nile.
