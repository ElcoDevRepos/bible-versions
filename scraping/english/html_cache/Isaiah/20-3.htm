Throughout the Bible, when the LORD speaks, it signifies the importance and certainty of the message. This is consistent with the prophetic tradition where God directly instructs His prophets.<p><b>&#8220;Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years</b><br>Isaiah is referred to as "My servant," highlighting his role as a faithful messenger of God. The act of going "naked and barefoot" is symbolic, representing humiliation and vulnerability. In the ancient Near East, such actions were often used as prophetic signs to convey a message. The duration of "three years" suggests a period of completeness and divine timing, often seen in biblical narratives (e.g., Jonah in the belly of the fish for three days).<p><b>as a sign and omen</b><br>The terms "sign" and "omen" indicate that Isaiah's actions were meant to serve as a prophetic warning. In biblical context, signs are often used by God to communicate His intentions or to confirm His word (e.g., the rainbow as a sign to Noah). An omen, in this context, suggests a forewarning of impending judgment or events.<p><b>against Egypt and Cush</b><br>Egypt and Cush (modern-day Sudan) were powerful nations during Isaiah's time, often seen as symbols of worldly strength and reliance. Historically, these nations were involved in political alliances and conflicts with Israel and Judah. The prophecy against them signifies God's sovereignty over all nations and serves as a warning against placing trust in human power rather than in God. This aligns with other biblical prophecies where reliance on foreign powers is condemned (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and purposes through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful nation in the ancient Near East, often seen as a symbol of worldly power and reliance on human strength rather than God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>A region south of Egypt, often associated with Ethiopia, representing another nation that Israel might be tempted to rely on instead of trusting in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_years.htm">Three Years</a></b><br>The period during which Isaiah acted out this prophetic sign, symbolizing the impending judgment and humiliation of Egypt and Cush.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_symbolism.htm">Prophetic Symbolism</a></b><br>Isaiah's actions serve as a vivid, living parable.

Isaiah shares this honorable title, "my servant," with a select few among God's saints - with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a>), Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), Caleb (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>), Job (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>; <a href="/job/42-7.htm">Job 42:7, 8</a>), Eliakim (<a href="/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a>), and Zerubbabel (<a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>).

Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130). It has been proposed, by an arbitrary emendation, to cut down the time to "three days;" but a three days' sign of the kind could not have been expected to have any important effect. The supposed "impropriety" of Isaiah's having "gone naked and barefoot" for three years arises from a misconception of the word "naked." which is not to be taken literally (see the comment on ver. 2). The costume adopted would be extraordinary, especially in one of Isaiah's rank and position; but would not be in any degree "improper." It would be simply that of working men during the greater part of the day (see <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26, 27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
