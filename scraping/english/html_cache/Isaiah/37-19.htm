The casting of gods into the fire symbolizes the complete defeat and humiliation of these nations' deities. In the ancient Near East, the destruction of idols was a common practice to demonstrate the superiority of the conqueror's gods. This act also highlights the futility of worshipping man-made objects, as they could not protect themselves or their worshippers. The imagery of fire is significant in the Bible, often representing judgment and purification (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>).<p><b>for they were not gods</b><br>This statement underscores the biblical truth that idols are not true deities. The Bible consistently teaches that there is only one true God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). The false gods of the nations are powerless and cannot save or deliver. This theme is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describes idols as having mouths but not speaking, eyes but not seeing. The impotence of these so-called gods is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing the sovereignty and uniqueness of the God of Israel.<p><b>but only wood and stone</b><br>The materials mentioned here, wood and stone, were commonly used in the construction of idols in the ancient world. These materials are lifeless and perishable, highlighting the absurdity of worshipping them. The prophets often mocked the idea of worshipping objects made from such materials (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the folly of idolatry and the contrast between the living God and lifeless idols.<p><b>the work of human hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that these idols are man-made creations, not divine beings. The work of human hands implies that these gods are subject to human limitations and creativity. This is a direct challenge to the belief systems of the surrounding nations, which attributed divine power to these objects. The Bible frequently contrasts the Creator God, who made the heavens and the earth, with idols made by human hands (<a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24-25</a>). This distinction is crucial in understanding the biblical worldview, which elevates the Creator above all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

The point is historical fact (<a href="/2_kings/19-18.htm">2 Kings 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The Assyrians treated the idols as plunder&#8212;proof that nothing about those statues could protect the cities that trusted in them (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God had long warned His people about such powerless images: &#8220;There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-28.htm">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and destroyed them</b><p>&#8226; The idols not only burned; they were shattered to pieces. That destruction underlines their impotence (<a href="/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast this with Gideon tearing down Baal&#8217;s altar; even a single Israelite could topple a false god (<a href="/judges/6-30.htm">Judges 6:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Meanwhile, the living LORD &#8220;sits enthroned forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>).
