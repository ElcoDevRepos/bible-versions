The phrase "But now" suggests a transition from previous judgments or circumstances to a new declaration of hope and assurance. It highlights God's active involvement in the lives of His people, contrasting with any prior messages of warning or judgment.<p><b>He who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel:</b><br>The use of "created" and "formed" underscores God's intimate involvement in the origin and development of the nation of Israel. "Jacob" and "Israel" refer to the patriarch Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, symbolizing the transformation and covenant relationship with God. This dual reference emphasizes both the individual and collective identity of the people. The language echoes <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27 and 2</a>:7, where God creates and forms humanity, indicating a personal and purposeful act of creation.<p><b>Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;</b><br>The command "Do not fear" is a common biblical reassurance, found in passages like <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, offering comfort and courage. "Redeemed" refers to the act of deliverance or buying back, often used in the context of freeing someone from slavery or bondage. This redemption is both physical, as seen in the Exodus from Egypt, and spiritual, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<p><b>I have called you by your name;</b><br>Calling by name signifies a personal relationship and intimate knowledge. In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing someone's name implied authority and a deep connection. This phrase reflects God's personal care and attention to His people, reminiscent of <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, where Jesus, the Good Shepherd, calls His sheep by name, indicating a personal and protective relationship.<p><b>you are Mine!</b><br>This declaration of possession signifies a covenant relationship, where God claims Israel as His own. It reflects the covenantal language found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>, where God declares Israel to be His treasured possession. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers being God's possession, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, emphasizing belonging and identity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks directly to His people, assuring them of His presence and protection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the patriarch of the Israelites, symbolizing the entire nation of Israel. Jacob's name was changed to Israel, indicating a transformation and a divine purpose.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, formed and redeemed by Him. This term encompasses the collective identity of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation_and_formation.htm">Creation and Formation</a></b><br>Refers to God's sovereign act of bringing Israel into existence and shaping them as His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The act of God saving His people, which in the Old Testament often refers to deliverance from physical or spiritual bondage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_god.htm">Identity in God</a></b><br>Understand that our identity is rooted in being created and formed by God.

Knowing that we are redeemed should empower us to live boldly for Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_relationship.htm">Personal Relationship</a></b><br>Recognize the personal nature of God's call.
