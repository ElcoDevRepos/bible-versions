In the arid climate of the Middle East, water is a precious resource, and its scarcity can lead to severe hardship. Biblically, water often represents life and sustenance (<a href="/genesis/21-14.htm">Genesis 21:14-19</a>, <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>). The imagery of seeking water but finding none underscores the desperation and helplessness of those in need. This can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual thirst, where people seek fulfillment and meaning but find emptiness without God.<p><b>their tongues are parched with thirst.</b><br>The parched tongue is a vivid image of extreme thirst and suffering. This condition reflects the physical reality of dehydration and the spiritual reality of longing for God&#8217;s presence and righteousness (<a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>). In the ancient Near East, such a state would be life-threatening, emphasizing the urgency of divine intervention. This phrase can also be seen as a call to recognize our own spiritual dryness and need for God&#8217;s living water.<p><b>I, the LORD, will answer them;</b><br>Here, the LORD (Yahweh) promises to respond to the cries of the poor and needy. This assurance of divine intervention is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God is depicted as a protector and provider for the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). The use of "I, the LORD" emphasizes God&#8217;s sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant people. It reassures believers that God hears their prayers and is actively involved in their lives.<p><b>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</b><br>This phrase reaffirms God&#8217;s commitment to His chosen people, Israel, and by extension, to all who call upon Him. The promise of not forsaking them echoes throughout the Bible, highlighting God&#8217;s enduring faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>). In a historical context, this assurance would have been particularly comforting during times of exile or oppression. Theologically, it points to the steadfast love of God, who remains with His people through trials and tribulations. This promise also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who embodies God&#8217;s ultimate act of not forsaking humanity (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_and_needy.htm">The Poor and Needy</a></b><br>This refers to those who are physically and spiritually destitute, seeking sustenance and relief.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to provide for and not forsake His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen nation through whom God reveals His character and promises, often representing His people as a whole.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/water.htm">Water</a></b><br>Symbolic of life, sustenance, and spiritual refreshment, often used in Scripture to represent God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thirst.htm">Thirst</a></b><br>Represents a deep need or longing, both physically and spiritually, that only God can satisfy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God promises to answer and not forsake His people, demonstrating His unwavering faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_thirst.htm">Spiritual Thirst</a></b><br>Just as physical thirst needs quenching, our spiritual thirst can only be satisfied by God&#8217;s presence and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Recognize our need to rely on God for both physical and spiritual needs, trusting in His provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_needy.htm">Compassion for the Needy</a></b><br>As God cares for the poor and needy, we are called to reflect His compassion in our actions towards others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_promises.htm">Hope in God's Promises</a></b><br>In times of need, hold onto the hope that God hears and responds to our cries, providing in His perfect timing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_41_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 41:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_41_17_God_s_care_for_needy.htm">How does Isaiah 41:17 demonstrate God's provision for those in need?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_41_17_God_s_care_and_faithfulness.htm">What does Isaiah 41:17 reveal about God's character and faithfulness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_in_tough_times_Isaiah_41_17.htm">How can Isaiah 41:17 encourage us to trust God in difficult times?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_passages_echoing_Isaiah_41_17.htm">Which New Testament passages echo the promise found in Isaiah 41:17?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Isaiah_41_17_to_community_service.htm">How can we apply Isaiah 41:17 to our community service efforts today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_41_17_God_s_promise_to_the_poor.htm">How does Isaiah 41:17 reflect God's promise to provide for the needy and poor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_41_17_context_and_meaning.htm">What historical context surrounds Isaiah 41:17, and how does it influence its interpretation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_41_17_God_s_compassion_shown.htm">How does Isaiah 41:17 demonstrate God's compassion and faithfulness to His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_41.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_oppressing_the_poor_disrespect_god.htm">Does oppressing the poor disrespect their Creator?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_assyria_conquer_israel.htm">Why did Assyria conquer Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_hunger.htm">What does the Bible say about feeding the hungry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_social_gospel_entail.htm">What does the social gospel entail?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 41:17 Mean</div><b>The poor and needy seek water, but there is none</b><p>- The verse opens with people in real, physical distress. They are literally poor and literally thirsty. Scripture frequently identifies God&#8217;s concern for such individuals (<a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>).<p>- Water is essential for life; its absence pictures vulnerability and helplessness. <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a> invites the thirsty to come, showing God&#8217;s consistent heart to satisfy needs.<p>- By specifying &#8220;poor and needy,&#8221; God spotlights those least able to help themselves, underscoring that divine provision is not earned but graciously given (<a href="/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their tongues are parched with thirst</b><p>- The image intensifies: tongues swollen and cracked from drought. <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a> captures the same sensation, &#8220;My flesh faints for You in a dry and weary land.&#8221;<p>- Thirst also portrays spiritual desperation (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>). When material resources dry up, hearts are primed to recognize their deeper need for the living God (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p>- The realism of the scene grounds the promise that follows; God meets actual bodily needs while addressing the soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I, the LORD, will answer them</b><p>- God responds personally. He is not distant; He hears and answers (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a>).<p>- &#8220;Answer&#8221; implies prayer is already rising from the thirsty. Even groans count as petitions (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26-27</a>).<p>- The use of the covenant name &#8220;LORD&#8221; (YHWH) ties the promise to His unchanging character revealed to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>). What He was then, He remains now.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them</b><p>- God anchors the pledge in His covenant with Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). To forsake the needy would contradict His own nature (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p>- &#8220;Not forsake&#8221; reassures both body and spirit. Provision may come through rain, springs, or unexpected means (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>), but the guarantee is Him.<p>- This commitment undergirds later promises of restoration and messianic hope (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15-16</a>), culminating in Christ who embodies God-with-us (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a> paints a vivid scene of people at the end of their resources. God sees their literal thirst, hears their cries, and pledges never to abandon them. The verse showcases His compassion, covenant faithfulness, and readiness to intervene. For believers today, it affirms that the Lord who once satisfied parched tongues still attends to every need&#8212;physical, emotional, and spiritual&#8212;answering those who call on Him and promising never to forsake His own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">When the poor and needy . . .</span>--The promise may perhaps take as its starting-point the succour given to the return of the exiles, but it rises rapidly into the region of a higher poetry, in which earthly things are the parables of heavenly, and does not call for a literal fulfilment any more than "wines of the lees," of <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm" title="And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.">Isaiah 25:6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-20.</span> - The crowning promise is that of spiritual support and refreshment through' the dull and dreary time of the Captivity, during which Israel dwells as it were in a desert, without water, or shade, or the relief to the eye which is furnished by the greenery of trees and shrubs. God was able to make of this "wilderness a standing water, and water-springs of the dry ground" (<a href="/psalms/107-35.htm">Psalm 107:35</a>), and he promises to do so (ver. 18). The soul that longs for him, that thirsts after him, feeling that it dwells "in a barren and dry land, where no water is" (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), shall be relieved and satisfied by a revelation of God's presence, and an outpouring of his grace unusually copious and abundant. God's grace is shadowed out under the two similitudes of water and verdure, as in <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>, and, to some extent, in <a href="/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23-25</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The poor and needy</span>;
