Fire consuming straw is a common biblical metaphor for judgment (e.g., <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). Straw, being lightweight and easily flammable, represents the frailty and vulnerability of those who stand against divine will. This imagery underscores the inevitability and thoroughness of God's judgment.<p><b>and as dry grass shrivels in the flame</b><br>The comparison to dry grass emphasizes the speed and intensity of the destruction. In the arid climate of the ancient Near East, dry grass would quickly ignite and be consumed by fire. This reflects the cultural understanding of fire as a purifying and consuming force. The imagery serves as a warning to the Israelites of the consequences of their disobedience.<p><b>so their roots will decay and their blossoms will blow away like dust</b><br>Roots symbolize stability and life, while blossoms represent beauty and potential. The decay of roots and the scattering of blossoms indicate total ruin and loss of future hope. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral decay of Israel, leading to their eventual exile. The imagery of dust recalls <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where humanity's mortality is highlighted, reinforcing the theme of judgment.<p><b>for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The rejection of divine instruction is a central theme in the prophetic literature. The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts of divine judgment and warfare. This phrase highlights the Israelites' willful disobedience and the serious nature of their rebellion against God's covenant, as seen throughout the history of Israel (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-15</a>).<p><b>and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel</b><br>The title "Holy One of Israel" underscores God's unique and set-apart nature, emphasizing His moral purity and the call for His people to reflect His holiness. Despising God's word indicates a deep-seated contempt and rebellion, which is a recurring issue in Israel's history (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). This rejection is not just of the law but of the relationship and covenant with God, pointing to the need for repentance and foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Christ, who perfectly fulfills the law and prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.

Just as fire instantly consumes straw and shrivels dry grass, so unrepentant people lose both hidden strength and visible beauty. The cause is clear: they rejected God&#8217;s instruction and despised His word. The warning is sobering, yet it also calls us to cherish Scripture, stay rooted in obedience, and trust the Lord who alone preserves life and fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Therefore as the fire devoureth.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the tongue of fire. </span>The scene brought before us is--(1) that of a charred and burnt-up field, horrible and hideous to look upon (comp. <a href="/hebrews/6-8.htm" title="But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.">Hebrews 6:8</a>); (2) that of a tree decayed and loathsome. The double imagery represents the end of the riotous mirth of the unjust judges.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, etc. A general judgment is now pronounced against all the forms of wickedness enumerated - a judgment of ruin or destruction. It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or "combination of two figures," the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. <span class="cmt_word">As the fire devoureth the stubble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a tongue of fire eats up stubble</span>. "<span class="accented">Tongue</span> of fire" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in <a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>. But it well depicts the power of fire to lick up clean all that comes in its way. Isaiah elsewhere notes the analogy, making it the foundation of simile (<a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the flame consumeth the chaff</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and as dry grass sinks down inflame</span>. The withered grass of pastures was burnt by farmers to improve the after-growth (Lucan, 'Pharsal.,' 9:182). <span class="cmt_word">Their root shall be as rottenness</span> (comp. <a href="/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a>). The root is the last thing to decay. When that fails, the case is desperate. Judah's "root" did not utterly fail (see <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>); but the present warning is to individuals and classes (vers. 8, 11, 18, 20-23), not to the nation. <span class="cmt_word">Their blossom shall go up as dust</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their external glory shall crumble and waste away. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have cast away the Law.</span> All the sins of Israel had this one thing in common - they were transgressions of the Law of God as delivered to them by Moses, and enforced upon them by the prophetical order (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Despised the word</span>; or, <span class="accented">the speech</span>. <span class="accented">Imrah</span> is rarely used by Isaiah. It does not refer to the written "Word," but to the declarations of God by the mouth of his prophets (see <a href="/isaiah/28-23.htm">Isaiah 28:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a tongue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
