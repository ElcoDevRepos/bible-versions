The act of offering one's back to be struck signifies submission and willingness to endure suffering. Historically, flogging was a common punishment in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including among the Israelites. This phrase prophetically points to the suffering of Jesus Christ, who was scourged before His crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>, <a href="/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15</a>). The voluntary nature of the suffering highlights the servant's obedience and submission to God's will, paralleling Christ's submission to the Father (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, the beard was a symbol of dignity and respect. To have one's beard torn out was a severe humiliation and a sign of utter disgrace. This act of violence and shame is indicative of the deep humiliation the servant willingly endures. The New Testament does not specifically mention Jesus' beard being plucked, but the overall theme of humiliation and suffering is consistent with the accounts of His passion (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67-68</a>). This phrase underscores the servant's acceptance of shame and dishonor, which is a type of Christ's own experience of mockery and abuse.<p><b>I did not hide My face from scorn and spittle</b><br>Scorn and spitting were expressions of contempt and rejection in biblical times, often used to disgrace someone publicly. The servant's refusal to hide his face signifies his acceptance of this public humiliation. This is fulfilled in the New Testament when Jesus is mocked, spat upon, and scorned by the soldiers and others during His trial and crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67, 27</a>:30, <a href="/mark/14-65.htm">Mark 14:65, 15</a>:19). The servant's endurance of such treatment without retaliation or avoidance is a profound demonstration of meekness and strength, reflecting the character of Christ, who endured the cross, despising the shame (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant_of_the_lord.htm">The Servant of the Lord</a></b><br>This passage is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which prophetically describe the suffering and mission of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
