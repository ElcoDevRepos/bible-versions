Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was often in conflict with Israel. The border signifies the extent of the calamity, reaching the very edges of their territory. This phrase highlights the widespread nature of the suffering, indicating that the entire nation is affected. Historically, Moab was known for its pride and idolatry, which often led to its downfall as prophesied by various prophets, including Isaiah.<p><b>Their wailing reaches Eglaim;</b><br>Eglaim is a location within Moab, though its exact site is uncertain today. The mention of Eglaim emphasizes the depth of the sorrow, as the wailing is not confined to one area but spreads throughout the land. This reflects the comprehensive nature of divine judgment. The wailing signifies a deep mourning, possibly for the loss of life, land, and security. In biblical terms, wailing is often associated with repentance or acknowledgment of sin, though in this context, it may simply reflect despair.<p><b>it is heard in Beer-elim.</b><br>Beer-elim, meaning "well of the mighty ones," is another location in Moab. The sound reaching Beer-elim suggests that the lamentation is so intense that it travels great distances. This could symbolize the far-reaching consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The mention of Beer-elim may also serve as a reminder of God's past provisions and the people's failure to remain faithful. The geographical spread of the wailing underscores the totality of the judgment and the inescapable nature of divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Earlier history shows Moab alternating between hostility and uneasy alliance with Israel (<a href="/bsb/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/bsb/2_kings/3.htm">2 Kings 3</a>). Now the prophet describes ruin so thorough that, in his words, &#8220;Ar in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>). Verse 8 sits in the middle of that lament, spotlighting how far and wide the grief spreads&#8212;an echo of the totality of the judgment God promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> and later echoed in <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Outcry That Carries</b><p>&#8220;For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The &#8220;outcry&#8221; is the collective scream of an entire nation suddenly stripped of security.<p>&#8226; Earlier verses mention weeping in Dibon and wailing in Nebo (<a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2&#8211;3</a>); verse 5 describes Moab&#8217;s heart &#8220;crying out&#8221; as fugitives flee.
