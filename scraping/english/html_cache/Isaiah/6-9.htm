It reflects the prophetic nature of Isaiah's mission, where God communicates His will directly to the prophet. This is a common theme in the prophetic books, where God often speaks directly to His chosen messengers.<p><b>Go and tell this people:</b><br>The command to "go" signifies the active role of the prophet as God's messenger. "This people" refers specifically to the Israelites, emphasizing their identity as God's chosen nation. Historically, this period was marked by spiritual decline and political turmoil in Judah, necessitating a prophetic call to repentance and awareness.<p><b>&#8216;Be ever hearing, but never understanding;</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual dullness and obstinacy of the people. Despite having access to God's word and prophets, they fail to grasp the deeper spiritual truths. This condition is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus uses similar language to describe those who hear His parables but do not understand (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). It highlights the theme of spiritual blindness and the need for divine intervention to truly understand God's message.<p><b>be ever seeing, but never perceiving.&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of sensory verbs "hearing" and "seeing" emphasizes the people's persistent failure to comprehend God's revelations. This reflects a hardened heart and a refusal to acknowledge God's works and warnings. The concept of seeing without perceiving is also found in the Gospels, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their lack of spiritual insight (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).

Ardent dreams of reformation and revival, the nation renewing its strength like the eagle, were scattered to the winds; and he had to face the prospect of a fruitless labour, of feeling that he did but increase the evil against which he strove. It was the very opposite mission of that to which St. Paul was sent, to "open men's eyes, and turn them from darkness to light" (<a href="/acts/26-18.htm" title="To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.">Acts 26:18</a>). It is significant that the words that followed were quoted both by the Christ (<a href="/context/matthew/13-14.htm" title="And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which said, By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive:">Matthew 13:14-15</a>; <a href="/mark/4-12.htm" title="That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.">Mark 4:12</a>), by St. John (<a href="/john/12-40.htm" title="He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.">John 12:40</a>), and by St. Paul (<a href="/context/acts/28-26.htm" title="Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:">Acts 28:26-27</a>), as finding their fulfilment in their own work and the analogous circumstances of their own time. History was repeating itself. To Isaiah, as with greater clearness to St. Paul (Romans 9-11), there was given the support of the thought that the failure which he saw was not total, that even then a "remnant should be saved;" that though his people had "stumbled," they had not "fallen" irretrievably; that the ideal Israel should one day be realised. The words point at once to the guilt of "this people "--we note the touch of scorn ("populus <span class= "ital">iste"</span>) in the manner in which they are mentioned (<a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-11.htm" title="For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.">Isaiah 28:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-14.htm" title="Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 28:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-3.htm" title="And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.">Matthew 9:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>)--and to its punishment. All was outward with them. Words did not enter into their minds ("heart," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"understanding," rather than "feeling"). Events that were "signs of the times," calls to repentance or to action, were taken as things of course. For such a state, after a certain stage, there is but one treatment. It must run its course and "dree its weird," partly as a righteous retribution, partly as the only remedial process possible. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye indeed... see ye indeed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">hearing hear</span>... <span class="accented">in seeing see -</span> with the force of "Listen and bear; look and see;" "Attend, "that is," with the outward souse, and catch all that sense can catch, but without perception of the inward meaning" (see <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>, etc.).
