The act of sprinkling signifies purification and atonement, indicating that the Servant's work will extend beyond Israel to include many nations. This foreshadows the universal scope of Christ's atonement, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>). The imagery also connects to the Great Commission, where the message of salvation is to be spread to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>Kings will shut their mouths because of Him.</b><br>This indicates awe and reverence from the world's leaders, who will be silenced by the Servant's work and message. Historically, kings were often seen as the ultimate authority, but here they are depicted as being humbled. This can be linked to <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Christ. The phrase suggests a future recognition of the Servant's authority and the truth of His message, which was initially hidden or misunderstood.<p><b>For they will see what they have not been told,</b><br>This implies a revelation of truth that was previously unknown or unrecognized by the nations. It suggests that the Servant's work will bring new understanding and insight, fulfilling prophecies that were not fully comprehended before. This can be connected to the mystery of the Gospel being revealed to the Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>), highlighting the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and they will understand what they have not heard.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the transformative power of the Servant's message, leading to a deep comprehension that goes beyond mere hearing. It suggests a spiritual awakening and enlightenment among the nations, aligning with the theme of revelation found in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-26</a>.

The "sprinkling" is that of the priest who cleanses the leper (<a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-17.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the veil.">Leviticus 4:17</a>), and this was to be done by Him who was Himself counted as a leper "smitten of God" (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a>). We may probably trace an echo of the words in the "sprinkling clean water" of <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, in the "blood of sprinkling," of <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>.
