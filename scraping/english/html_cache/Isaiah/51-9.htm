In biblical literature, the "arm" often symbolizes strength and deliverance (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>). The repetition of "awake" emphasizes urgency and a plea for God to act as He has in the past. This reflects the Israelites' desire for God to demonstrate His power as He did during the Exodus, a foundational event in their history.<p><b>Wake up as in days past, as in generations of old.</b><br>Here, the speaker is urging God to act as He did in previous generations, recalling the mighty acts of deliverance and salvation. This reflects a common biblical theme of remembering God's past faithfulness as a basis for hope in present circumstances (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>). The reference to "days past" and "generations of old" suggests a longing for the miraculous interventions seen in the history of Israel, such as the deliverance from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>Was it not You who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced through the dragon?</b><br>"Rahab" in this context is a symbolic name for Egypt, representing chaos and opposition to God's people (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>). The imagery of cutting Rahab to pieces and piercing the dragon evokes God's victory over chaotic forces, reminiscent of the Exodus narrative where God defeated Pharaoh's army. The "dragon" is often associated with evil and chaos in biblical literature (<a href="/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12-13</a>, <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>).

(1) The redeemed and ideal Israel, or (2) the Servant of the Lord, or (3) the prophet, or (4) Jehovah, as in self-communing, after the manner of men, like that of Deborah in <a href="/judges/5-12.htm" title="Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, you son of Abinoam.">Judges 5:12</a>. On the whole the first seems the preferable view; but the loftiness of poetry, perhaps, transcends all such distinctions. The appeal is, in any case, to the great deeds of God in the past, as the pledge and earnest of yet greater in the future. "Rahab," as in <a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm" title="For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.">Isaiah 30:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm" title="You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; you have scattered your enemies with your strong arm.">Psalm 89:10</a>, is Egypt; and the "dragon," like "leviathan" in <a href="/psalms/74-13.htm" title="You did divide the sea by your strength: you brake the heads of the dragons in the waters.">Psalm 74:13</a>, stands for Pharaoh.

There has been much doubt as to the utterer of this "splendid apostrophe." Zion, the prophet, the angels, Jehovah, and God the Son pleading with God the Father, have been suggested. To us it seems simplest and best to assign the passage to the prophet. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Awake, awake</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-23.htm">Psalm 35:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>). When God neglects the prayers and supplications of his people, he is spoken of as "asleep," and needing to be awoke by a loud cry. The anthropomorphism is obvious, and <span class="accented">of course</span> not to be taken literally (see <a href="/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Put on strength</span>. Gird the strength to thee (<a href="/psalms/93-1.htm">Psalm 93:1</a>) which thou hadst laid aside while thou wept asleep<span class="cmt_word">. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab?</span> rather, <span class="accented">was it not thou that didst cleave Rahab in pieces?</span> Here, as in <a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a> and Psalm 89:10, "Rahab" would seem to be a symbolical expression for Egypt. "<span class="accented">Rahab"</span> is literally "<span class="accented">pride</span>," or "the proud one." The event alluded to, both here and in <a href="/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>, is the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea (see ver. 10<span class="cmt_word">). And wounded the dragon</span>. "The dragon" is another symbol of the Egyptian power (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, "Pharaoh, King of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers"). Originally designating God's great enemy, Satan (<a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>), it is a term which comes to be applied to the adversaries of the Almighty generally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/51-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Awaken,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#363;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">awaken,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#363;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">put on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3847.htm">Strong's 3847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrap around, to put on a, garment, clothe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">strength,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1494;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5797.htm">Strong's 5797: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, might</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O arm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2220.htm">Strong's 2220: </a> </span><span class="str2">The arm, the foreleg, force</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Wake up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1434;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#363;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as in days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
