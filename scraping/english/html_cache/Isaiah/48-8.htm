Despite God's continuous communication through prophets, the people failed to truly listen. This echoes the broader biblical theme of Israel's stubbornness, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>, where the people's ears are described as uncircumcised, unable to hear God's word. The failure to hear is not due to a lack of opportunity but a willful neglect of God's voice.<p><b>you have never understood;</b><br>Understanding in the biblical sense often involves not just intellectual comprehension but a heart response. The Israelites' lack of understanding is a recurring issue, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where God tells Isaiah that the people will hear but not understand. This reflects a spiritual blindness and hardness of heart, which Jesus also addresses in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>).<p><b>for a long time your ears have not been open.</b><br>This phrase suggests a prolonged period of spiritual insensitivity. The imagery of closed ears is used throughout Scripture to describe a refusal to heed God's commands (<a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>). The duration implies a deep-seated rebellion and resistance to God's guidance, which has historical roots in Israel's repeated cycles of disobedience and repentance.<p><b>For I knew how deceitful you are;</b><br>God's omniscience is emphasized here, as He is fully aware of Israel's deceitful nature. This deceit is not just in actions but in their hearts, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful above all things. The deceitfulness of Israel is a reflection of their unfaithfulness to the covenant, often turning to idolatry and false worship.<p><b>you have been called a rebel from birth.</b><br>This phrase underscores the inherent rebellious nature of Israel, tracing back to their origins. The term "rebel" indicates a deliberate opposition to God's authority. This rebellion is evident from the time of the Exodus, where despite witnessing God's miracles, the people frequently complained and disobeyed (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>). The concept of being rebellious from birth also points to the doctrine of original sin, suggesting an innate tendency towards sinfulness that requires divine intervention for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
