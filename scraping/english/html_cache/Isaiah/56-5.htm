The speaker is God, who is making a commitment to bestow something significant upon a particular group. In the context of <a href="/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>, this promise is directed towards foreigners and eunuchs who join themselves to the Lord, emphasizing God's inclusive nature and His willingness to extend blessings beyond the traditional boundaries of Israel.<p><b>in My house and within My walls</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple, the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people. "Within My walls" suggests a place of security and belonging. This promise indicates that those who were once considered outsiders will be granted a place of honor and acceptance within the community of God's people, reflecting the temple's role as a house of prayer for all nations (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>).<p><b>a memorial and a name</b><br>A "memorial" signifies remembrance and honor, while a "name" represents identity and legacy. In ancient cultures, having a name that is remembered was a significant aspect of one's legacy. This promise assures that those who might have been forgotten or marginalized will be given a lasting place of honor and recognition by God Himself.<p><b>better than that of sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase highlights the superiority of the promised blessing. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, having sons and daughters was crucial for continuing one's family line and legacy. However, God promises something even greater than familial ties, suggesting a spiritual legacy and identity that surpasses earthly relationships.<p><b>I will give them an everlasting name</b><br>The promise of an "everlasting name" indicates a perpetual and unbreakable covenant. This is a profound assurance of eternal significance and identity, contrasting with the temporal nature of human achievements and relationships. It echoes the biblical theme of God's eternal covenant with His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>.<p><b>that will not be cut off</b><br>This final phrase underscores the permanence and security of God's promise. In a world where names and legacies can be easily forgotten or erased, God assures that His promise will endure. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the eternal nature of His covenant, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>, where God promises an everlasting covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, promising blessings and an everlasting name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners_and_eunuchs.htm">Foreigners and Eunuchs</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a> includes these groups, who were often marginalized in Israelite society.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_god.htm">The House of God</a></b><br>Refers to the temple, symbolizing God's presence and acceptance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Isaiah prophesied, representing God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_inclusive_promise.htm">God's Inclusive Promise</a></b><br>God's promise extends beyond ethnic and social boundaries, offering hope and inclusion to all who seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/everlasting_identity_in_christ.htm">Everlasting Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Our identity in Christ is secure and eternal, surpassing any earthly status or relationship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_spiritual_heritage.htm">The Value of Spiritual Heritage</a></b><br>Spiritual heritage and identity in God's family are more valuable than biological lineage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God's promises are trustworthy and everlasting, providing assurance and hope to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_part_of_god's_household.htm">Living as Part of God's Household</a></b><br>As members of God's household, we are called to live in a way that reflects our eternal identity and honors God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_56_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 56:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_56_5_God_s_promise_to_faithful.htm">How does Isaiah 56:5 emphasize God's promise to the faithful?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_everlasting_name_in_Isa_56_5.htm">What does "an everlasting name" signify in Isaiah 56:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_56_5_s_role_in_church_inclusivity.htm">How can Isaiah 56:5 encourage inclusivity within the church community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_56_5_to_NT_spiritual_inheritance.htm">Connect Isaiah 56:5 with New Testament teachings on spiritual inheritance.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Isaiah_56_5_daily.htm">How can believers apply the promise of Isaiah 56:5 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_a_name_better_than_sons.htm">What does Isaiah 56:5 mean by "a name better than sons and daughters"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_56_5_and_Gentile_inclusion.htm">How does Isaiah 56:5 relate to the inclusion of Gentiles in God's covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Isaiah_56_5_important_for_eunuchs.htm">Why is the promise in Isaiah 56:5 significant for eunuchs in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_56.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 56?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_eunuchs.htm">What does the Bible say about eunuchs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_view_eunuchs_in_modern_gender_terms.htm">How should we understand Jesus&#8217;s mention of eunuchs (Matthew 19:12) in light of modern biology and gender concepts?
