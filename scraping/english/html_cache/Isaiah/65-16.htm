The act of invoking a blessing suggests a return to a covenant relationship with God, reminiscent of the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The land, often a reference to the Promised Land, signifies a place of divine promise and fulfillment. This reflects a restoration of the people to a state of righteousness and divine favor.<p><b>will do so by the God of truth</b><br>The "God of truth" emphasizes God's faithfulness and reliability. In Hebrew, the word for truth is "emet," which conveys firmness and stability. This phrase underscores the idea that blessings are grounded in the unchanging nature of God. It contrasts with the false gods and idols that were often worshipped in Israel's history, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>. The invocation of blessings by the God of truth signifies a rejection of idolatry and a return to worshiping the one true God.<p><b>and whoever takes an oath in the land</b><br>Taking an oath is a solemn act that involves invoking God's name as a witness to the truth of one's words. In biblical times, oaths were serious commitments, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>. This phrase suggests a society where truthfulness and integrity are paramount, reflecting a community living in accordance with God's laws.<p><b>will swear by the God of truth</b><br>Swearing by the God of truth reinforces the idea that God is the ultimate standard of truth and justice. This practice is rooted in the understanding that God is omniscient and omnipotent, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>, where God swears by Himself because there is no higher authority. It indicates a future where God's truth is acknowledged and upheld in all aspects of life.<p><b>For the former troubles will be forgotten</b><br>This phrase speaks to a time of renewal and redemption, where past afflictions and sins are no longer remembered. It echoes the promise of a new covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to forgive iniquity and remember sin no more. The forgetting of former troubles signifies a complete transformation and healing of the nation.<p><b>and hidden from My sight</b><br>The idea of troubles being hidden from God's sight suggests divine forgiveness and the removal of sin. In biblical theology, sin separates humanity from God, but through repentance and divine grace, sins are blotted out, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>. This phrase points to a future where God's people are fully reconciled to Him, living in peace and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_truth.htm">God of Truth</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's nature as faithful and reliable.

In Isaiah&#8217;s restored kingdom, every promise, contract, or courtroom testimony will be uttered with full awareness that God hears and judges (<a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical picture: society&#8217;s entire legal and relational fabric is rewoven with integrity, because truth is defined by the One who never lies (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the former troubles will be forgotten</b><p>&#8226; The motivation behind this purified speech is a healed past. &#8220;Former troubles&#8221; include exile, idolatry, and personal sorrows.

Perhaps it is recant that God will call them <span class="accented">by his own Name</span> (<a href="/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>) - "the people of God" (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a>); and thence it will become natural for them to use no other name, either when they call for a blessing on themselves, or have to confirm a covenant with others. <span class="cmt_word">In the God of truth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the God of the Amen</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the God who keeps covenant and promise, to which the strongest formula of consent was the word "Amen" (see <a href="/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>, etc.). Similarly, St. John calls our Lord "the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness" (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because the former troubles are forgotten</span>. When the blessed time has come wherein men call themselves by the Name of the Lord, and know of only one God as the Source of blessing and the confirmation of an oath, then the former state of human affairs, with all its "troubles," will have passed away, and the new era will be inaugurated, which the prophet proceeds to describe at length (vers. 17-25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/65-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">invokes a blessing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1461;&#1436;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7791;&#183;b&#257;&#183;r&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
