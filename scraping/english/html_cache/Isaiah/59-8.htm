Biblically, "peace" (shalom) signifies wholeness, harmony, and well-being, not just the absence of conflict. The Israelites' ignorance of this way reflects their estrangement from God, who is the source of true peace. Historically, Israel often sought peace through alliances with pagan nations rather than trusting in God (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). This failure to know the way of peace is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul cites this verse in <a href="/romans/3-17.htm">Romans 3:17</a> to describe humanity's universal sinfulness.<p><b>and there is no justice in their tracks.</b><br>Justice, a central theme in the Bible, is often associated with righteousness and fairness. The absence of justice in their paths indicates a society where God's laws are ignored, leading to corruption and oppression. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, justice was a covenantal obligation, reflecting God's character (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a>). The prophets frequently condemned the lack of justice as a sign of Israel's rebellion (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). This phrase underscores the moral decay and societal breakdown resulting from turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>They have turned them into crooked paths;</b><br>The imagery of "crooked paths" suggests deliberate deviation from God's righteous ways. In biblical symbolism, a straight path represents obedience and alignment with God's will (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The choice to create crooked paths indicates intentional sin and rebellion. This reflects the historical pattern of Israel's disobedience, as seen in their idolatry and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a>). Theologically, it points to the human tendency to distort God's truth, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<p><b>no one who treads on them will know peace.</b><br>This final phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of sin. Those who follow these crooked paths will not experience the peace that comes from a right relationship with God. This aligns with the biblical principle that peace is a result of righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>). The lack of peace is both a present reality and a future judgment for those who persist in sin. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is presented as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), offering reconciliation with God and true peace to those who follow Him (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.
