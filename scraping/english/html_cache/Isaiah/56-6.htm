In the Old Testament, foreigners were often seen as outsiders, but here they are invited to join the community of believers. This foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The Hebrew term for "join" implies a strong commitment, akin to a covenant relationship, similar to Ruth's declaration to Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>).<p><b>to minister to Him</b><br>The role of ministering to God was traditionally reserved for the Levites, but this passage opens it to foreigners, indicating a shift towards a more inclusive worship. This anticipates the New Testament priesthood of all believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Ministering involves acts of worship, service, and devotion, reflecting a heart committed to God.<p><b>to love the name of the LORD</b><br>Loving God's name signifies reverence and devotion. In Hebrew culture, a name represents one's character and essence. Loving God's name means embracing His nature and commandments. This aligns with the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>and to be His servants</b><br>Being a servant of God implies obedience and dedication. This echoes the call to servanthood seen throughout Scripture, where true greatness is found in serving others (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>). It also reflects the life of Jesus, the ultimate servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Keeping it holy was a demonstration of faithfulness and trust in God's provision. For foreigners to observe the Sabbath signifies their full integration into the covenant community. This also points to the rest found in Christ, who is the Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>).<p><b>and who hold fast to My covenant</b><br>Holding fast to the covenant involves faithfulness and adherence to God's laws. This phrase emphasizes the importance of commitment and loyalty to God's promises. It connects to the New Covenant established through Jesus' sacrifice, which is open to all who believe (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). The call to hold fast is a recurring theme, urging believers to remain steadfast in their faith (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites who choose to follow the God of Israel.

It is to Him that the foreigners are joining themselves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship, instituted by God as a sign of His covenant with Israel.
