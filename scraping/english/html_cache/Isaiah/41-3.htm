In the context of <a href="/isaiah/41.htm">Isaiah 41</a>, it refers to a conqueror, often interpreted as Cyrus the Great, who God uses to fulfill His purposes. Historically, Cyrus was known for his swift and effective military campaigns. Biblically, this pursuit can be seen as God's sovereignty in using nations and leaders to accomplish His divine plans, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, where God calls Nebuchadnezzar "My servant" to execute judgment.<p><b>going on safely</b><br>The safety in this context implies divine protection and assurance of success. This reflects the biblical theme that God grants victory and protection to those He chooses to use for His purposes. In the broader narrative of Isaiah, God reassures Israel of His protection and deliverance, paralleling the safety granted to the conqueror. This can be connected to the promise of safety and guidance found in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, where God leads His people through the "valley of the shadow of death."<p><b>hardly touching the path with his feet</b><br>This imagery conveys speed and ease, suggesting that the conqueror's progress is unhindered and swift. It reflects the idea of divine empowerment, where obstacles are removed, and the path is made smooth. This can be compared to <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who wait on the Lord "will run and not grow weary." The phrase also evokes the miraculous nature of God's intervention, reminiscent of how Jesus walked on water in <a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>, symbolizing authority over natural laws and obstacles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant_of_the_lord.htm">The Servant of the Lord</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/41.htm">Isaiah 41</a>, the "he" in verse 3 is often interpreted as a reference to a servant or a chosen one of God, possibly Cyrus the Great, who is used by God to fulfill His purposes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The nations are those being pursued. They represent the obstacles or challenges that stand against God's plans and His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path.htm">The Path</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the journey or mission that God has set before His servant.
