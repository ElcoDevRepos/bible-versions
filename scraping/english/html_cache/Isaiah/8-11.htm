The "strong hand" suggests a forceful and compelling communication, indicating the seriousness of the message. In biblical context, God's hand often symbolizes power and control (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). This divine intervention underscores the importance of the prophet's role as a mouthpiece for God, ensuring that the message is delivered with clarity and authority.<p><b>instructing me not to walk in the way of this people</b><br>Here, "this people" refers to the Israelites who were living in disobedience and rebellion against God. The instruction not to "walk in the way" signifies a call to separate from the prevailing cultural and spiritual practices that were contrary to God's will. This echoes the biblical theme of holiness and separation found throughout Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). The historical context involves the political and social pressures of the time, as Judah faced threats from surrounding nations and was tempted to rely on alliances rather than trust in God. This directive to Isaiah serves as a reminder of the need for faithfulness and reliance on God alone, foreshadowing the ultimate example of obedience and separation from sin found in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the recipient of God's message.

Having declared his absolute confidence, not only that the attack of Pekah and Rezin will fail (vers. 1-4), but that Assyria also (ver. 8), nay, that all the nations of the earth (ver. 9) will fail, and bring destruction upon themselves, if they "devise devices" against God's true people, the prophet explains the ground of his confidence by relating a special "instruction" which he had received from God some time previously, he had been bidden to separate himself from the mass of his countrymen in thought and feeling, and to cling only to Jehovah, who would "be for a Sanctuary" (ver. 14) to his own, but "for a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offence" to all others. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord.</span> Mr. Cheyne regards this passage as "a short oracle, complete in itself," and entirely unconnected with what has preceded.

He was not to entertain their suspicions, or to hope their hopes, or to fear their fears.
