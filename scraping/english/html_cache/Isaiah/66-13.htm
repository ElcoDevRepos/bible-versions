In ancient Israel, the family unit was central, and the mother's role was crucial in providing emotional and physical support. This imagery is used to convey God's deep love and personal involvement with His people. The metaphor of God as a nurturing figure is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a>, where the psalmist describes his soul as being like a weaned child with its mother, indicating peace and contentment.<p><b>so will I comfort you</b><br>Here, God promises to provide the same level of comfort and reassurance to His people as a mother does to her child. This reflects God's commitment to His covenant with Israel, offering solace and restoration. The context of <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66</a> is one of hope and renewal after judgment, where God reassures the faithful remnant of His presence and support. This promise of comfort is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of sending the Holy Spirit as the Comforter (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>), indicating the ongoing presence of God with His people.<p><b>and you will be consoled over Jerusalem.</b><br>This phrase addresses the specific context of Jerusalem, which had experienced destruction and exile. The promise of consolation over Jerusalem signifies the restoration and renewal of the city, both physically and spiritually. Jerusalem holds a central place in biblical prophecy as the city of God, and its restoration is a recurring theme in the prophets. This consolation is not only for the physical city but also for the people of God, who are to find peace and hope in God's redemptive plan. The ultimate fulfillment of this promise is seen in the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where God dwells with His people, wiping away every tear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

The love which Zion <span class= "ital">gives, </span>the love which her children receive from the nations, are both but shadows of the infinite tenderness of Jehovah. In this instance the object of the mother's love that comforts is not the child at the breast, but the full-grown man, returning, like the prodigal, to his home after long years of exile. The words are characteristic at once of the special tie which unites the son to the mother, almost more than to the father, in most Eastern nations, and, perhaps also, of the prophet's personal memories of his own mother's love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As one</span>;
