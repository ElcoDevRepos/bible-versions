In ancient Israel, the harvest was a time of joy and thanksgiving to God for His provision. The removal of joy and gladness signifies divine judgment and desolation. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic theme of God's judgment against Moab, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a>. The orchard, a place of fruitfulness, becomes a symbol of barrenness and loss.<p><b>no one sings or shouts in the vineyards.</b><br>Vineyards were central to the agricultural economy and social life in ancient Israel and surrounding regions. Singing and shouting during the grape harvest were expressions of communal joy and gratitude. The absence of these sounds underscores the severity of the judgment. This silence can be compared to the lamentations found in <a href="/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, which also speaks of the cessation of joy in Moab's vineyards, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the prophecy.<p><b>No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses;</b><br>The winepress is a place where grapes are crushed to produce wine, a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet and a symbol of blessing and abundance. The lack of activity in the winepresses indicates a halt in production and prosperity. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>, to depict judgment and destruction. The absence of grape trampling signifies the end of economic and social vitality.<p><b>I have put an end to the cheering.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the judgment. God Himself declares the cessation of joy and celebration. The cheering, often associated with successful harvests and God's favor, is silenced by His decree. This reflects the sovereignty of God over nations and His ability to bring about both blessing and judgment. The prophetic voice here serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's ways, as seen throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this chapter.

Those who have heard the vintage-songs in the north of Italy and elsewhere will appreciate the sadness of this silence. <span class="cmt_word">The treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses</span>. Wine-presses were in or near the vineyards. They consisted of two vats, or two reservoirs cut in the rock, one above the other, with a passage of communication between them. The grapes were placed in the upper vat or reservoir, and were crushed by the naked feet of the vintagers. Sometimes as many as seven persons "trod the wine-press" together (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 45). It was usual for them to sing as they trod (<a href="/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</span> The prophet is the mouthpiece of God.
