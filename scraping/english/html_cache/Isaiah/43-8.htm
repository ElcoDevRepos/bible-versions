Historically, the Israelites were often called out by God for a purpose, such as being His chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). This calling out can also be seen as a summons to witness or testify, a common theme in Isaiah where God calls His people to be witnesses to His power and faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>).<p><b>who have eyes but are blind</b><br>The reference to having eyes but being blind is a metaphor for spiritual blindness. Despite having the ability to see physically, the people are unable to perceive or understand God's truth and works. This blindness is often attributed to idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus frequently addressed spiritual blindness, particularly among the Pharisees (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>), highlighting the need for spiritual insight and understanding.<p><b>and who have ears but are deaf</b><br>Similar to the previous phrase, this refers to spiritual deafness. The people have the ability to hear but fail to listen to God's voice and commandments. This deafness is a recurring issue in the Old Testament, where the Israelites often ignored the prophets' warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus often used the phrase "He who has ears, let him hear" (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>) to emphasize the importance of truly listening and understanding His teachings. This phrase underscores the need for a responsive and obedient heart to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Think of Israel&#8217;s earlier &#8220;coming out&#8221; of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and the future regathering from exile (<a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-7</a>).
