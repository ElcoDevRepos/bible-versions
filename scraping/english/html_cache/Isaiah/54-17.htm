In the historical context, Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations. The promise here is that any weapon or strategy devised against God's people will ultimately fail. This reflects God's sovereignty and His role as a protector, similar to His deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The imagery of weapons suggests both physical and spiritual battles, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare.<p><b>and you will refute every tongue that accuses you</b><br>This part highlights the power given to God's people to overcome false accusations and slander. In ancient times, legal disputes and verbal accusations were common, and a good reputation was highly valued. The assurance here is that God will provide the wisdom and strength to counter any false claims, reminiscent of Jesus' promise in <a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19-20</a> that the Spirit will provide words in times of trial. This also points to the ultimate vindication of believers at the final judgment.<p><b>This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD</b><br>The term "heritage" indicates an inheritance or legacy, suggesting that this promise is a lasting possession for those who serve God. It connects to the covenantal promises given to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a>), emphasizing that God's protection and vindication are part of the spiritual inheritance of His people. This heritage is not earned but given by grace, reflecting the unchanging nature of God's promises.<p><b>and their vindication is from Me,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores that the source of vindication and justice is God Himself. It assures believers that their righteousness and justification come from the Lord, not from their own efforts. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33-34</a>, where Paul speaks of God as the one who justifies. The declaration by the LORD affirms His authority and commitment to His people, providing comfort and confidence in His ultimate justice and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
