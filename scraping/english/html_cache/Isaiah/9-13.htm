In the context of Isaiah, the Northern Kingdom of Israel faced Assyrian aggression as a form of God's judgment for their idolatry and disobedience. The "Him who struck them" refers to God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment. This concept is consistent with the covenantal relationship outlined in Deuteronomy, where blessings and curses are contingent on Israel's obedience. The people's lack of repentance is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing human stubbornness and the need for genuine contrition.<p><b>they did not seek the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, reflecting His ultimate authority and power. The failure to seek God indicates a spiritual blindness and self-reliance, contrasting with the call to seek God found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> and <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament call to repentance and faith in Christ, who embodies the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.
