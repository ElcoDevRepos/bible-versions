In the context of Isaiah, "far off" can refer to the nations surrounding Israel, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all peoples, not just Israel. Historically, this reflects the period when the Assyrian Empire was a dominant force, and God's actions were meant to be a testimony to all nations. Biblically, this echoes the call to the Gentiles, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where God&#8217;s salvation is extended to the ends of the earth. It foreshadows the New Testament mission to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-47.htm">Acts 13:47</a>.<p><b>you who are near, acknowledge My might.&#8221;</b><br>"Near" refers to the people of Israel, who are in close covenant relationship with God. This is a call for them to recognize and affirm God's power and authority, especially in light of His deliverance and judgment. The historical context involves the immediate threat of Assyrian invasion, where God&#8217;s might was demonstrated in the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-37</a>). Culturally, this is a reminder of the covenantal obligations of Israel to worship and trust in God alone. Theologically, it points to the need for personal acknowledgment of God's power, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>. This also typifies the call to recognize Jesus Christ's authority and divinity, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee shall bow and every tongue confess His lordship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
