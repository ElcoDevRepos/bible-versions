In biblical times, dogs were often seen as unclean animals, scavengers that roamed the streets. The imagery of "ravenous dogs" suggests leaders who are driven by their own appetites, never content with what they have. This reflects a broader biblical theme of warning against greed and self-indulgence, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-16</a>, which speaks of things that are never satisfied. The metaphor underscores the moral and spiritual decay of those who should be guiding the people.<p><b>They are shepherds with no discernment;</b><br>Shepherds in the Bible are often symbolic of leaders or those in positions of spiritual authority, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd. The lack of discernment indicates a failure to understand or care for the needs of the people they are supposed to lead. This failure is a stark contrast to the ideal shepherd who knows and tends to his flock. The absence of discernment suggests a spiritual blindness and a neglect of duty, which is condemned throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-10</a>, where God rebukes the shepherds of Israel for their negligence.<p><b>they all turn to their own way,</b><br>This phrase highlights the self-centeredness and rebellion against God's path. Turning to one's own way is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with sin and disobedience, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, which states, "We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way." This turning away from God's guidance leads to moral and spiritual chaos, emphasizing the need for repentance and alignment with God's will.<p><b>each one seeking his own gain:</b><br>The pursuit of personal gain at the expense of others is a direct violation of the biblical principle of selflessness and service. This behavior is condemned in various scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>, which encourages believers to consider others above themselves. The leaders' focus on personal profit reflects a corruption of their role and a betrayal of their responsibility to serve the community. This self-serving attitude is antithetical to the example set by Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>In this context, the shepherds symbolize leaders or those in positions of spiritual authority who are failing in their duties.
