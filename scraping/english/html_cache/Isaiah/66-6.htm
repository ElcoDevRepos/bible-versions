In the context of Isaiah, Jerusalem often serves as a focal point for God's dealings with His people. The uproar could symbolize the tumultuous events surrounding God's judgment or the anticipation of His intervention. Historically, Jerusalem has been a center of both divine blessing and judgment, reflecting the spiritual state of its inhabitants.<p><b>listen to the voice from the temple!</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The mention of the temple indicates that the voice is authoritative and divine. This voice represents God's direct communication, emphasizing the sacredness and seriousness of the message. The temple's role as a place of sacrifice and atonement also underscores the gravity of the situation, as it is from here that God pronounces His judgments.<p><b>It is the voice of the LORD,</b><br>The identification of the voice as the LORD's confirms the divine origin of the message. In the Old Testament, the LORD (Yahweh) is the covenant God of Israel, whose voice carries ultimate authority and power. This phrase assures the audience that the message is not from a human source but from God Himself, demanding attention and reverence.<p><b>repaying His enemies what they deserve!</b><br>This phrase highlights the theme of divine retribution, a common motif in prophetic literature. God's justice involves repaying His enemies according to their deeds, reflecting His holiness and righteousness. The concept of retribution is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God promises to vindicate His people and judge those who oppose Him. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, where God's enemies will face His wrath, and His justice will be fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and the location of the temple.
