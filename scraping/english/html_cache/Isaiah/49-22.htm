It is a common prophetic formula that underscores the message as coming directly from God, not from human origin. This sets the stage for the importance and certainty of the following promises.<p><b>Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations:</b><br>The imagery of God lifting His hand signifies an act of power and authority. In ancient times, raising a hand was a gesture used to command attention or to signal an action. Here, it indicates God's intention to intervene in the affairs of the nations, suggesting a divine orchestration of events on a global scale. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and raise My banner to the peoples:</b><br>A banner in biblical times was a rallying point for troops or a symbol of identity and purpose. By raising His banner, God is calling the peoples of the world to recognize His sovereignty and to gather under His authority. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, aligning with the New Testament revelation of the gospel being for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>They will bring your sons in their arms:</b><br>This phrase depicts a tender and protective action, where the nations are seen as caretakers of Israel's children. It suggests a reversal of fortunes where those who were once oppressors or distant are now acting as nurturers. This can be connected to the return of the exiles to Jerusalem, as well as a broader eschatological vision of the restoration of Israel.<p><b>and carry your daughters on their shoulders:</b><br>Carrying daughters on shoulders is an image of honor and care, indicating a position of safety and prominence. This reflects a cultural practice where children were carried on shoulders as a sign of affection and protection. It symbolizes the high regard and support that the nations will show towards Israel, fulfilling prophecies of restoration and favor (<a href="/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>). This also typifies the ultimate care and elevation that believers receive through Christ, who carries His people and grants them a place of honor in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks and acts with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_peoples.htm">Nations and Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations outside of Israel, indicating a global scope of God's plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>Symbolic of the people of Israel, representing the future generations and the continuity of God's promise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/banner.htm">Banner</a></b><br>A signal or standard raised to gather people, symbolizing God's call and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arms_and_shoulders.htm">Arms and Shoulders</a></b><br>Represents care, support, and the act of carrying, indicating the Gentiles' role in assisting Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is in control of history and fulfills His promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_nations.htm">The Role of the Nations</a></b><br>God uses the nations to accomplish His purposes, showing that His plan includes all people, not just Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_hope.htm">Restoration and Hope</a></b><br>The imagery of sons and daughters being carried signifies hope and restoration for the future, encouraging believers to trust in God's redemptive plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan demonstrates the unity and diversity within the body of Christ, calling believers to embrace and celebrate this diversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation_in_god's_mission.htm">Active Participation in God's Mission</a></b><br>Believers are called to be active participants in God's mission, raising His banner and being a light to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_49_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 49:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_49_22_God_s_gathering_promise.htm">How does Isaiah 49:22 illustrate God's promise to gather His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_nations_peoples_in_Isaiah_49_22.htm">What role do "nations" and "peoples" play in Isaiah 49:22's prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_49_22_Faith_in_God_s_sovereignty.htm">How can Isaiah 49:22 inspire our faith in God's sovereignty today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_49_22_to_NT_on_inclusivity.htm">Connect Isaiah 49:22 with New Testament teachings on God's inclusivity.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_join_God_s_mission_in_Isaiah_49_22.htm">How can we participate in God's mission as described in Isaiah 49:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_49_22_and_nations_gathering.htm">How does Isaiah 49:22 relate to the gathering of nations in biblical prophecy?

The verse looks back to real historical returns, speaks to present movements of God&#8217;s people, and points forward to the ultimate gathering under Messiah&#8217;s banner, when every promise will stand fulfilled exactly as spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">The Gentiles . . . the people . . .</span>--Both words are used of the heathen.
