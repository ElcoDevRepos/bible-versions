In the context of <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66</a>, it follows a description of God's final judgment and the establishment of a new order. The imagery of "going forth" can be seen as a transition from the old world to the new, reflecting the eschatological themes present in the latter chapters of Isaiah.<p><b>they will see the corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the consequences of rebellion against God. The "corpses" symbolize the ultimate fate of those who oppose God's will. Historically, this can be linked to the fate of the Assyrians and Babylonians, who were judged for their oppression of Israel. Theologically, it serves as a warning of the final judgment, where those who reject God face eternal separation. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-21</a>, where the defeat of God's enemies is depicted.<p><b>for their worm will never die</b><br>The "worm" is often interpreted as a symbol of ongoing decay and corruption. This phrase is a vivid depiction of eternal punishment, suggesting a state of perpetual suffering. It is reminiscent of Jesus' words in <a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>, where He describes hell as a place "where their worm does not die." This connection underscores the seriousness of rejecting God's authority and the eternal nature of divine judgment.<p><b>their fire will never be quenched</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol for judgment and purification. In this context, it represents the unending nature of God's judgment on the wicked. The imagery of unquenchable fire is also found in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a> and <a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>, reinforcing the concept of eternal punishment for those who oppose God.<p><b>and they will be a horror to all mankind</b><br>This phrase indicates the universal recognition of God's judgment. The sight of the corpses serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of rebellion, instilling fear and awe in all who witness it. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's justice being evident to all nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/28-19.htm">Ezekiel 28:19</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10-11</a>.

The verse answers doubters of eternal judgment, assures believers of God&#8217;s final victory, and magnifies the grace that rescues all who trust in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/66.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And they shall go forth . . .</span>--As at the close of Isaiah 48, 57, each ending a great section of the volume, so here, the vision of restoration and blessedness is balanced by that of the righteous condemnation of the wicked. The outward imagery is suggested, as in <a href="/joel/3-12.htm" title="Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.">Joel 3:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-12.htm" title="And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.">Zechariah 14:12</a>, by that of the great battle of the Lord (<a href="/context/isaiah/66-15.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>). Those who are slain in that battle are thought of as filling the valleys round about Jerusalem, especially the valley of Jehoshaphat ("Jehovah judges "), devoured by worms, or given to the flames. Taken strictly, therefore, the words do not speak of the punishment of the souls of men after death, but of the defeat and destruction upon earth of the enemies of Jehovah. The words that tell us that "the worm shall not die" and that "the fire shall not be quenched" point, however, to something more than this, to be read between the lines. And so those words became the starting-point of the thoughts of later Judaism as to Gehenna (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/8-17.htm" title="Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel.">Ecclesiasticus 8:17</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/judith/16-17.htm" title="Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.">Judith 16:17</a>, and the Targum on this passage), of the words in which our Lord Himself gave utterance to what, at least, seemed to express those thoughts (<a href="/context/mark/9-44.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:44-48</a>), of the dominant eschatology of Christendom. Even so taken, however, with this wider range, it is still a question whether the words are to be taken literally or figuratively (though this, perhaps, is hardly a question), whether the bodies, which represent souls, are thought of as not destroyed, but only tormented, or as consumed to nothing, by the fire and by the worm, whether those two agents represent sufferings of sense or spirit. The one aspect of the future life which they tend to exclude is that which presents the idea of a suffering that may be purifying. That idea is not without apparent support in other passages of Scripture (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/context/romans/5-17.htm" title="For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)">Romans 5:17-21</a>; <a href="/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>); but we cannot say that it entered into the prophet's thoughts here. What he emphasises is the eternal antagonism between the righteousness of God and man's unrighteousness, and this involves the punishment of the latter as long as it exists. In any case there is a strange solemnity in this being the last word of the prophet's book of revelation, even as there is a like awfulness in the picture of the final judgment, which appears in <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>, at all but the close of our Lord's public teaching. Cheyne quotes a singular rubric of the Jewish ritual, that when this chapter, or Ecclesiastes 12, or Malachi 3, was read in the synagogue, the last verse but one should be repeated after the last, so that mercy might appear as in the end triumphant after and over judgment. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/66.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases</span>, etc. Here is more imagery, which it is impossible to understand literally. The carcases could not remain always to be looked at, nor while they remained could the sight of them be otherwise than loathsome to God's redeemed saints. Again, they could not be at the same time burnt with fire and eaten by worms. "The prophet, by the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility of our conceiving of the thing set forth as realized in any material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state, but <span class="accented">in figures</span> drawn from the present world" (Delitzsch). Does he mean more than this - that the redeemed shall have in their thoughts, at any rate from time to time, the fact that, while they have by God's great mercy been saved and brought into His kingdom, there are those who have not been saved, but lie for ever under the awful sentence of God's wrath? This is a knowledge which the redeemed must have, and which may well produce a salutary effect on them, intensifying their gratitude and maintaining in them a spirit of reverent fear<span class="cmt_word">. Their worm shall not die, neither shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">their fire be quenched</span> (comp. <a href="/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44, 46, 48</a>). It cannot be by chance that the evangelical prophet concludes his glorious prophecy with this terrible note of warning. Either he was divinely directed thus to terminate his teaching, or he felt the need that there was of his emphasizing all the many warnings dispersed throughout his "book" by a final, never-to-be-forgotten picture. The undying worm and the quenchless fire - images introduced by him - became appropriated thenceforth to the final condition of impenitent sinners (Jud. 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17), and were even adopted by our Lord himself in the same connection (<a href="/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>.). The incongruity of the two images shows that they are not to be understood literally; but both alike imply everlasting continuance, and are incompatible with either of the two modern heresies of universalism or annihilationism. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh</span> (comp. <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, where the word <span class="accented">deraon</span> is rendered "contempt"). The Jewish rabbis regarded it as anomalous that any portion of Scripture should conclude with words of ill omen. When, therefore, this chapter was read in the synagogue, or the last of Ecclesiastes, or Lamentations, or Malachi, they directed that after the reading of the last verse, the last verse but one should he repeated, to correct the sad impression that would otherwise have been left upon the mind. But Isaiah thought it salutary to leave this sad impression (comp. <a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/66-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;As they go forth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
