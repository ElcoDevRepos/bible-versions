The concept of God existing from eternity is foundational in Scripture, affirming His self-existence and sovereignty. This echoes God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," highlighting His eternal presence and unchanging nature. The eternal aspect of God is also seen in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "from everlasting to everlasting, you are God," underscoring His timeless existence and authority over creation.<p><b>and none can deliver out of My hand</b><br>This statement asserts God's supreme power and authority. The imagery of God's hand is often used in Scripture to symbolize His power and protection (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>). It conveys the idea that once God has determined to act, no force can thwart His will. This is a reassurance of His omnipotence and the security of those who are in His care. The phrase also reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He is their ultimate protector and deliverer.<p><b>When I act, who can reverse it?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the irrevocability of God's actions. It highlights His sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will. The idea that no one can reverse God's actions is a theme found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, where Job acknowledges that no purpose of God can be thwarted. This underscores the certainty and reliability of God's promises and judgments. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of His plans, including the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, whose redemptive work cannot be undone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
