The rejection of these waters signifies a rejection of God's protection and guidance. Historically, the waters of Shiloah were a vital source for the city, representing stability and sustenance. This phrase highlights the people's preference for political alliances over divine reliance. Theologically, it can be seen as a metaphor for rejecting the Messiah, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).<p><b>and rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah</b><br>Rezin was the king of Aram (Syria), and the "son of Remaliah" refers to Pekah, the king of Israel. This phrase indicates that the people of Judah were placing their trust in foreign alliances rather than in God. Historically, this was during the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Rezin and Pekah formed a coalition against Judah. The rejoicing in these leaders shows a misplaced trust in human power and political strategies. This rejection of divine protection in favor of human alliances is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, contrasting with the call to trust in God alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book and is delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloah.htm">Shiloah</a></b><br>A reference to the gently flowing waters of the Siloam pool in Jerusalem, symbolizing God's provision and peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who formed an alliance with the Northern Kingdom of Israel against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_remaliah.htm">Son of Remaliah</a></b><br>Pekah, the king of Israel, who allied with Rezin against Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The Southern Kingdom, which is being warned by Isaiah for its lack of trust in God and its political alliances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The "gently flowing waters of Shiloah" symbolize God's quiet and steady provision.

Later verses show that, because of this choice, the mighty flood of Assyria would overflow them (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>).

Judah chose the latter, rejecting the LORD&#8217;s gentle care symbolized by Shiloah and placing false confidence in Rezin and Pekah. Scripture records this not as ancient trivia but as a timeless warning&#8212;true security flows from trusting God&#8217;s steady faithfulness, never from the shifting currents of human power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah . . .</span>--Grammatically, the words "this people" might seem to refer to Judah, and suggest the thought that the tyranny of Ahaz had made him so unpopular that his subjects welcomed the invaders. On this view Ahaz sought the alliance with Tiglath-pilneser as against his own subjects no less than against Syria or Ephraim. He was as a Ferdinand of Naples falling back on Austria to protect him against Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel. What line was the prophet to take? Was he to take the side of the king, or that of his rebellious subjects who were ready to sacrifice their independence? As it is, he sides with neither, and has a warning for each. Each is running blindly into destruction. The prophet could hardly have blamed the people of Syria and Israel for following their own kings; but it was for him a strange and monstrous thing that Judah should follow their example. We must remember, too, that in spite of the weakness and wickedness of Ahaz, the prophet's hopes rested on the house of David (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>), and that Hezekiah was already old enough to justify that hope. The "waters of Shiloah that go softly," issuing from the slope between Moriah and Zion, "fast by the oracles of God" (<a href="/psalms/46-4.htm" title="There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>), presenting so striking a contrast to the great rivers, Nile, Euphrates, Hiddekel (Tigris), on which stood the capitals of great empires, or even to the Abana and Pharpar of Syria, and the Jordan of Ephraim, were a natural symbol of the ideal polity and religion of Judah. (Comp. <a href="/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1-5</a>.) In acting as they did the people were practically apostatising as much as "that king Ahaz" of <a href="/2_chronicles/28-22.htm" title="And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.">2Chronicles 28:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as this people.</span> It is a question which people is intended, Judah or Israel. Ewald supposes Judah, and draws the conclusion that there was a strong party in Jerusalem which favored "the son of Tabeal." Dr. Kay does the same, but understands the charge against Judah to be, not that it sympathized with Rezin, but that it fell into the same sins. Other commentators suggest that Israel is the people intended (as in <a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>), the sense being carried on from ver. 4, where the word "Samaria" is suggestive of the Israelite people. <span class="cmt_word">Refuseth the waters of Shiloah</span>. The "pool of Siloah" (<a href="/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>) was the tank or reservoir at the southwestern foot of Ophel, which is supplied with water by a narrow conduit cut through the limestone rock for a distance of 1750 feet from the "Pool of the Virgin" on the opposite side of Ophel, in the Kedron valley. This pool itself is fed from reservoirs under the temple area, which have not yet been fully explored. It is probable that Isaiah uses the expression "waters of Shiloah" in a general sense for the streams, springs, reservoirs, conduits, which supplied the temple, and were connected with its service. "Refusing the waters of Shiloah" would then be, without any violent metaphor, refusing the temple service and worship, which was exactly what the Israelites had done from the time of Jeroboam. <span class="cmt_word">That go softly</span>.
