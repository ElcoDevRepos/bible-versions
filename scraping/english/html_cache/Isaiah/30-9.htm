Historically, the Israelites often turned away from God, seeking alliances with foreign nations like Egypt, which God had explicitly warned against. This rebellion is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to their covenant with God. The rebellion is not just a physical turning away but a spiritual defiance against God's authority and guidance.<p><b>Deceitful children</b><br>"Deceitful" indicates a lack of integrity and honesty in their relationship with God. The Israelites are described as children, emphasizing their immaturity and dependency, yet they choose deceit over truth. This deceit is evident in their false worship and insincere repentance. The term "children" also reflects their status as God's chosen people, who are expected to live in truth and righteousness. This deceit is contrasted with the call to be like children in faith, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of childlike faith and honesty.<p><b>Children unwilling to obey the LORD&#8217;s instruction</b><br>The phrase underscores the Israelites' refusal to listen to and follow God's teachings. The "LORD's instruction" refers to the Torah, the law given to Moses, which was meant to guide the Israelites in living a life pleasing to God. Their unwillingness to obey is a direct rejection of God's authority and wisdom. This disobedience is a central issue in the prophetic books, where prophets like Isaiah call the people back to faithfulness. The New Testament echoes this call to obedience, with Jesus fulfilling the law and urging His followers to live according to God's will. The Israelites' disobedience serves as a warning and lesson for future generations about the consequences of turning away from God's path.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

They do not drift from God; they push back against Him, much like the generation described in <a href="/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9-11</a> that refused to enter the land.<p>- The passage highlights that rebellion is first a heart issue. <a href="/proverbs/28-14.htm">Proverbs 28:14</a> warns, &#8220;Blessed is the man who always fears the LORD, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.&#8221; Israel has chosen the opposite path, hardening itself against divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Deceitful children</b><p>- &#8220;Deceitful&#8221; (or &#8220;lying&#8221;) stresses dishonesty toward both God and neighbor. Like <a href="/hosea/11-12.htm">Hosea 11:12</a> says, &#8220;Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit.&#8221;<p>- Their deceit shows up in religious hypocrisy&#8212;offering sacrifices while planning alliances with Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). This mirrors Jesus&#8217; indictment in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>, &#8220;This people honors Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s people are called to truthfulness because God Himself &#8220;does not lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). When His children live in deceit, they deny His character.<p>- Practical takeaway: lies always accompany rebellion. If we detect habitual dishonesty, it signals a deeper refusal to submit to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Children unwilling to obey the LORD&#8217;s instruction</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;unwilling to obey&#8221; shows an obstinate refusal to hear. Compare <a href="/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>, where watchmen cry, &#8220;Listen to the sound of the trumpet!&#8221; yet the people reply, &#8220;We will not listen.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Instruction&#8221; (torah) is God&#8217;s gracious guidance. To reject it is self-destructive, as <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a> states: &#8220;He who despises instruction will pay the penalty.&#8221;<p>- Their deafness is willful. <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a> predicts a similar future posture: people &#8220;will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires.&#8221; Israel is already doing this, demanding &#8220;pleasant words&#8221; rather than truth (<a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10-11</a>).<p>- The verse underscores covenant responsibility. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-7</a> called parents to teach God&#8217;s words diligently to their children. Refusal to listen breaks that chain and endangers the next generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a> paints a sober portrait: God&#8217;s covenant people are actively rebellious, habitually deceitful, and stubbornly unwilling to heed His life-giving instruction. The verse warns that rebellion breeds deception and deafness to truth, severing the blessings tied to obedience. For every believer today, the call is clear&#8212;submit to God&#8217;s authority, walk in truth, and keep ears and heart open to His Word, lest we repeat Israel&#8217;s tragic pattern.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">That this is a rebellious people.</span>--The words that follow were those which were thus written on the tablet.
