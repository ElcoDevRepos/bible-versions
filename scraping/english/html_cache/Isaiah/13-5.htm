Historically, this refers to the Medes and Persians who conquered Babylon. The mention of "faraway lands" emphasizes the vast reach of God's sovereignty, as He orchestrates events beyond Israel's immediate surroundings. This also reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of empires and their expansive territories.<p><b>from the ends of the heavens</b><br>This expression underscores the divine orchestration of the events, as "the ends of the heavens" implies a cosmic scale. It suggests that the impending judgment is not merely a human endeavor but one that involves the entire created order. This phrase can be connected to other biblical passages that speak of God's universal dominion, such as <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>, which declares the heavens as proclaiming God's glory.<p><b>the LORD and the weapons of His wrath</b><br>Here, the LORD is depicted as a divine warrior, a common motif in the Old Testament. The "weapons of His wrath" symbolize the instruments through which God executes judgment. This can be seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/50-25.htm">Jeremiah 50:25</a>, where God opens His armory against Babylon. Theologically, this highlights God's justice and His active role in history, using nations as instruments of His will.<p><b>to destroy the whole country</b><br>The phrase indicates the totality of the impending destruction, which in the historical context refers to Babylon. This destruction is both a literal and symbolic act of divine judgment. It serves as a warning to other nations and a reminder of God's ultimate authority over all kingdoms. This can be paralleled with the eschatological themes in Revelation, where God's final judgment is depicted as comprehensive and all-encompassing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, representing God's sovereignty and power.

This is no vague possibility; it is a certain event. &#8226; In Scripture God often speaks of future acts as though they are already happening (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>), underscoring His sovereignty. &#8226; Like the flood in <a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11&#8211;12</a>, judgment does not wait for human readiness; it arrives on God&#8217;s timetable. The present-tense urgency invites hearers to wake up spiritually before it is too late (<a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from faraway lands</b><p>Distance emphasizes both the reach of God&#8217;s rule and the surprise element of His judgment. &#8226; He can summon nations &#8220;from the north&#8221; against Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14&#8211;15</a>) or &#8220;from a distant land&#8221; against Babylon itself (<a href="/jeremiah/50-41.htm">Jeremiah 50:41</a>). &#8226; No empire is beyond His ability to mobilize; even unlikely instruments become tools in His hand (<a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). The phrase also hints that the invaders are not local skirmishers but a vast, organized coalition that Judah could never repel alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the ends of the heavens</b><p>This poetic picture stretches the mind: heaven&#8217;s outer edge meeting earth&#8217;s battlefield. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-32.htm">Deuteronomy 4:32</a> speaks of God&#8217;s acts being considered &#8220;from one end of the heavens to the other,&#8221; underlining universal scope. &#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a> shows the same imagery to portray infinite greatness. Isaiah uses it here to say, &#8220;Expect a judgment as wide as creation itself.&#8221; Nothing escapes God&#8217;s summons; His authority spans the cosmos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD and the weapons of His wrath</b><p>A startling pairing: the Lord Himself alongside lifeless weapons. &#8226; Scripture consistently shows that armies are merely extensions of God&#8217;s arm (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). &#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a> affirms that even a brutal nation can be &#8220;raised up&#8221; by God for His purposes. &#8226; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a> portrays Christ wielding the sword of judgment. The verse reminds us that judgment is not ultimately Babylon&#8217;s doing, Persia&#8217;s doing, or any human doing&#8212;it is the direct action of the LORD. He personally directs the outcome, guaranteeing both its timing and its effectiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to destroy the whole country</b><p>The goal is total devastation, not a warning shot. &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1&#8211;3</a> describes a similar sweeping ruin, where the earth is &#8220;emptied and laid waste.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/51-29.htm">Jeremiah 51:29</a> prophesies that Babylon itself will become a desolation. God&#8217;s judgments are thorough, matching the gravity of the sin they address. Yet behind the severity lies redemptive intent: removing evil so that righteousness can flourish (<a href="/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a> presents a vivid, literal picture of God summoning distant armies as &#8220;weapons of His wrath&#8221; to accomplish complete judgment. The verse underscores four truths: God&#8217;s sovereign control over world events, His limitless reach, His personal involvement in justice, and the comprehensive nature of His judgments. Believers are called to trust this righteous Lord who rules history and to align their lives with His holiness while there is still time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They come from a far country . . .</span>--The same phrase is used of Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm" title="Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yes, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.">Isaiah 46:11</a>, and in <a href="/isaiah/39-3.htm" title="Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from where came they to you?

The "end of heaven" represents the thoughts of Isaiah's time, the earth as an extended plain, and the skies rising like a great vault above. The phrase represents (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/19-6.htm" title="His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.">Psalm 19:6</a>), as it were, the <span class= "ital">ultima Thule </span>of discovery. For the "whole land," the Hebrew noun hovers, as often elsewhere, between the meanings of "earth," or "country." The LXX. favours the former meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They come from a far country</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>). Both Media and Persia were "far countries" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, "from the end of heaven" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">The weapons</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:25; 51:20). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy the whole land.</span> Many critics would render <span class="accented">ha-arets</span> by "the earth" here.
