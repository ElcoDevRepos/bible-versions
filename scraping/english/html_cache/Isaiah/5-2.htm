In ancient Palestine, vineyards required significant labor to remove stones and prepare the soil, indicating God's meticulous care and provision. The removal of stones can also symbolize the removal of obstacles or impurities, aligning with God's desire for Israel to be a holy nation. This imagery is reminiscent of God's covenant with Israel, where He promised to nurture and protect them if they remained faithful.<p><b>and planted the finest vines</b><br>The "finest vines" represent the people of Israel, chosen by God to be His special possession. This choice is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a holy people set apart by God. The use of "finest" suggests that God provided Israel with every advantage and blessing necessary to thrive spiritually and morally. This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, the true vine, as mentioned in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>, where believers are called to abide in Him to bear fruit.<p><b>He built a watchtower in the middle</b><br>The watchtower signifies God's protection and vigilance over Israel. In ancient vineyards, a watchtower was used to guard against thieves and wild animals, symbolizing God's constant watchfulness and care. This imagery can be connected to <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, which assures that God neither slumbers nor sleeps in His guardianship over His people. The central location of the watchtower emphasizes God's presence among His people, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and dug out a winepress as well</b><br>The winepress represents the expectation of a fruitful harvest, symbolizing the righteous deeds and spiritual fruit God anticipated from Israel. In biblical times, a winepress was essential for processing grapes into wine, a symbol of joy and blessing. This expectation is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are called to produce the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The winepress also foreshadows the judgment that comes when God's people fail to produce the expected fruit, as seen in <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19-20</a>.<p><b>He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes</b><br>This phrase highlights God's patience and long-suffering nature, as He gave Israel time to produce righteousness and justice. The expectation of "good grapes" reflects God's desire for His people to live according to His commandments and to be a light to the nations. This expectation is echoed in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God requires His people to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. The waiting period signifies God's grace, allowing time for repentance and growth.<p><b>but the fruit it produced was sour!</b><br>The sour fruit symbolizes Israel's failure to live up to God's expectations, producing injustice and unrighteousness instead of the desired righteousness. This outcome is a lament over Israel's spiritual decline and moral corruption, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. The sour fruit serves as a warning to all believers about the consequences of disobedience and unfaithfulness. This imagery is paralleled in the New Testament, where Jesus warns of the consequences of not bearing good fruit (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-19</a>). The sour fruit ultimately points to the need for redemption through Christ, who enables believers to produce the fruit of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard_owner.htm">The Vineyard Owner</a></b><br>Represents God, who carefully prepares and tends to His people, expecting them to bear good fruit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, who were given every opportunity to thrive spiritually.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_watchtower.htm">The Watchtower</a></b><br>A structure built for protection and oversight, indicating God's provision and vigilance over His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_winepress.htm">The Winepress</a></b><br>Represents the expectation of fruitful results from the vineyard, symbolizing the spiritual fruit God desires from His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/worthless_grapes.htm">Worthless Grapes</a></b><br>The disappointing outcome, symbolizing Israel's failure to live up to God's expectations despite His care and provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_care.htm">God's Provision and Care</a></b><br>Just as the vineyard owner provided everything necessary for the vineyard to thrive, God provides for us spiritually, equipping us to bear fruit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expectation_of_fruitfulness.htm">Expectation of Fruitfulness</a></b><br>God expects His people to produce good fruit, reflecting His character and fulfilling His purposes in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_unfruitfulness.htm">Consequences of Unfruitfulness</a></b><br>The production of worthless grapes serves as a warning of the consequences of failing to live according to God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers are called to examine their lives to ensure they are producing the fruit of the Spirit, as evidence of their relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_christ.htm">Dependence on Christ</a></b><br>True fruitfulness comes from abiding in Christ, the true vine, and relying on His strength and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_5_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 5:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_5_2_God_s_care_expectations.htm">How does Isaiah 5:2 illustrate God's care and expectations for His people?

Ii. 1; <a href="/context/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5-8</a>); in the "winepress," the temple in which the fruits of righteousness were to issue in the wine of joy and adoration (<a href="/zechariah/9-17.htm" title="For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.">Zechariah 9:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>). It was, we may note, one of the maxims of the Rabbis that the duty of a scribe was "to set a fence around the law" (<span class= "ital">Pirke Aboth, </span>i. 1). In the last clause of the verse the pleasant song suddenly changes its tone, and the "wild grapes (sour and hard, and not larger than bilberries) are types of deeds of harsh and cruel injustice on which the prophet proceeds to dwell.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He fenced it.</span> So the LXX., the Vulgate, Aben Ezra, Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lowth, Kay. Gesenius, Knobel, and Mr. Cheyne prefer to translate, "he dug it over;" while the Revisers of 1885 have suggested, "he made a trench about it." The word occurs only in this place, and has no cognates in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered out the stones</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In the stony soil of Palestine, to collect the surface stones into heaps, or build them into walls, is of primary necessity for the improvement of the land. Conversely the stones were put back, and scattered over the land, by those who wished to "mar" it (<a href="/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Planted it with the choicest vine</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>). The <span class="accented">sorek</span> seems to have been a particular kind of vine, reckoned superior to others. The etymology of the word indicates that it was of a deep red color. <span class="cmt_word">Built a tower</span> (comp. <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). Towers had to be built in gardens, orchards, and vineyards, that watch might be kept from them against thieves and marauders (see <a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Made a wine-press</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dug a winepress</span>. The excavation was made to contain a vat, above which was the "press," worked by men, who wrung the liquor out of a great bag containing the grapes. (See the Egyptian rock-paintings, passim, where the operation is represented repeatedly.) <span class="cmt_word">It brought forth wild grapes.</span> The natural, not the cultivated fruit, a worthless product. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He dug it up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#8216;az&#183;z&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
