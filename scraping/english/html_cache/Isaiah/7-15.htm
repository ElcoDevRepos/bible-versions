In the context of <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, this prophecy is given to King Ahaz as a sign from God. The child mentioned is often interpreted as a reference to the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ, who would embody perfect moral discernment. The ability to "reject evil and choose good" is a hallmark of wisdom and maturity, and in the case of Jesus, it signifies His sinless nature. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of moral choice and accountability, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where God sets before the Israelites life and death, blessings and curses, urging them to choose life.<p><b>He will be eating curds and honey</b><br>Curds and honey were common foods in ancient Israel, often associated with abundance and prosperity. However, in the context of <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, they also symbolize a time of hardship and simplicity. The land would be desolate due to the Assyrian invasion, and agriculture would be disrupted, leaving only basic foods like curds and honey. This reflects the historical context of the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Judah faced threats from surrounding nations. Theologically, this phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite His divine nature, lived a humble and simple life on earth. The reference to curds and honey also connects to the Promised Land described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating both sustenance and the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Verse 15 sits between promise and fulfillment, describing that child&#8217;s early life in a vivid, concrete way.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;By the time&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase marks a countdown. God ties His promise to a measurable point in the child&#8217;s development, underscoring that His word can be verified in real time (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights divine control over history; events on the political stage will move within the time span God states, not a moment later (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He knows enough to reject evil and choose good&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Scripture treats moral awareness as a real, observable milestone (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not abstract philosophy; it is a marker of practical discernment&#8212;when a child can recognize right from wrong in daily choices (cf. <a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p>&#8226; By referencing moral capacity, God ties national deliverance to the growth of an innocent child, contrasting Judah&#8217;s fearful unbelief with the trust of a little one (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He will be eating curds and honey&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Curds and honey were simple, readily available foods in a land recovering from war (<a href="/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The diet signals two realities:<p>&#8211; Plenty: even the most basic foods will not fail, showing God&#8217;s sustaining mercy (<a href="/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8211; Humility: the promised child will not live in royal luxury but in ordinary conditions, foreshadowing the lowly advent of Jesus (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene mirrors God&#8217;s care for His people in past wilderness seasons, where He supplied manna and quail (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4, 13</a>), reminding Judah that He will provide again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Immediate historical fulfillment</b><p>&#8226; Within a few short years&#8212;before the child of <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14&#8211;16</a> could reach moral discernment&#8212;Syria and Israel fell (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29&#8211;30</a>; 16:9).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s own son Maher-shalal-hash-baz, born in the next chapter, reinforces this rapid timetable (<a href="/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God proves faithful: the political threats vanish exactly as the prophecy schedules.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ultimate fulfillment in Christ</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22&#8211;23</a> cites <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, identifying Jesus as the virgin-born &#8220;Immanuel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; early life fits the pattern: humble surroundings (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>), divine provision despite danger (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13&#8211;15</a>), and a steady growth in wisdom and moral discernment (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<p>&#8226; The ordinary diet foretells the extraordinary mission: the Holy One sharing our common life so He can redeem it (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14&#8211;18</a>; 4:15).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical takeaways</b><p>&#8226; God links cosmic plans to family moments; He cares about diapers and dinner tables as much as He does about kingdoms (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Moral maturity is a threshold God honors; cultivating discernment in children matters for the unfolding of His purposes (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Provision often arrives in simple packages&#8212;curds and honey rather than lavish banquets&#8212;teaching contentment and trust (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a> anchors God&#8217;s promise in a child&#8217;s early years: before the boy can clearly choose good over evil, he will live on basic yet sufficient food, and Judah&#8217;s enemies will be gone. Historically, that clock started ticking the moment the prophecy was spoken; politically, it ran out exactly on schedule. Prophetically, the verse sets the tone for the Messiah&#8212;humble, dependent, yet central to God&#8217;s plan. The Lord&#8217;s faithfulness is tasted in simple meals, measured in a child&#8217;s milestones, and fulfilled in Jesus, the true Immanuel who shared our bread so we could share His salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">till he know, </span>or, <span class= "ital">when he shall know<span class= "bld">. . .</span> .</span>--By a strange inversion of the familiar associations of the phrase (<a href="/exodus/3-17.htm" title="And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm" title="For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>), probably, as the prophet spoke them, not without a certain touch of the irony of paradox, the words describe a time, not of plenty, but of scarcity.
