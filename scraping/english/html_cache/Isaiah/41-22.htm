In the ancient Near Eastern context, prophecy and divination were common practices, and the ability to foretell events was seen as a sign of divine power. This challenge highlights the impotence of idols compared to the omniscience of the God of Israel. The phrase underscores the biblical theme that only the true God knows the future, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<p><b>Tell the former things, so that we may reflect on them and know the outcome.</b><br>Here, the call is for the idols to recount past events accurately, which would allow people to understand their significance and outcomes. This reflects the importance of history in the biblical narrative, where past events are often recounted to reveal God's hand in guiding and shaping history. The ability to interpret past events is linked to wisdom and understanding, as seen in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. This phrase also emphasizes the continuity of God's plan throughout history.<p><b>Or announce to us what is coming.</b><br>This reiterates the challenge for idols to predict future events, further emphasizing their inability to do so. The prophetic tradition in Israel, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel, often involved foretelling future events as a demonstration of God's sovereignty and control over history. This phrase points to the unique role of biblical prophecy in revealing God's purposes and plans, ultimately culminating in the coming of Jesus Christ, who fulfills many Old Testament prophecies. The call to announce future events also foreshadows the eschatological themes found in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Can the false gods predict them as the pledge and earnest of predictions that go farther? Can they see a single year before them? We note that the challenge exactly corresponds to Isaiah's own method of giving "signs" that his words are not idly spoken (<a href="/context/isaiah/7-10.htm" title="Moreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,">Isaiah 7:10-14</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/38-7.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken;">Isaiah 38:7-8</a>). The other meaning is maintained, however, by some critics as more in harmony with <a href="/isaiah/43-18.htm" title="Remember you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.">Isaiah 43:18</a>. The things "for to come" lie, as it were, in the middle future, the "hereafter" of <a href="/isaiah/41-23.htm" title="Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.">Isaiah 41:23</a>, in the more remote.

God claims that the power of predicting the future is his own inalienable prerogative. He defies the idol-gods and their votaries to give any clear prediction of future events. No doubt the claim to possess the power was made very generally among the idolatrous nations, who almost universally practised divination, and in many case<span class="accented">s</span> possessed oracles. But it was a false claim, based upon fraud and cunning, which deceived men as often as dependence was placed upon it (Herod., 1:53, 91) and landed them in misfortune. <span class="cmt_word">The former things... things for to come.</span> Some commentators regard "the former things" as things actually past - "the beginnings of history, for instance, which to the heathen nations were wrapped in darkness" (Kay); but it seems better, on the whole, to understand (with Vitringa, Stier, Hahn, Cheyne, and Delitzsch) by "the former things" those in the immediate future, by "things for to come" those about to happen in remoter times. The former are, of course, much the easier to predict, since they fall to some extent within the domain of human foresight; the latter are more difficult; but the idol-gods are challenged to produce either the one or the other. <span class="cmt_word">What they be</span>.
