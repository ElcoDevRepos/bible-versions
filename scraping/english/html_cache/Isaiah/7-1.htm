He was known for his lack of faithfulness to God, unlike his predecessors Jotham and Uzziah, who were more righteous. Ahaz's reign was marked by idolatry and political alliances that were contrary to God's commands. The mention of his lineage highlights the contrast between his unfaithfulness and the more godly reigns of his father and grandfather. This period was one of political turmoil and spiritual decline in Judah.<p><b>Rezin king of Aram marched up to wage war against Jerusalem</b><br>Rezin was the king of Aram, also known as Syria, with its capital in Damascus. The Arameans were a significant power in the region and often in conflict with Israel and Judah. The phrase indicates a military campaign against Jerusalem, the capital of Judah. This was part of the Syro-Ephraimite War, where Rezin allied with Pekah, king of Israel, to pressure Ahaz into joining their coalition against the Assyrian Empire. The historical context shows the geopolitical tensions of the time, with smaller nations trying to resist the growing Assyrian threat.<p><b>He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel</b><br>Pekah was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, reigning from around 752 to 732 BC. His alliance with Rezin was an attempt to strengthen their position against Assyria. This coalition was also a threat to Judah, as they sought to force Ahaz into their alliance. The division between Israel and Judah, once a united kingdom under David and Solomon, is evident here, with Israel now acting as an adversary to Judah. This internal strife among God's people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>but he could not overpower the city</b><br>Despite the combined forces of Rezin and Pekah, Jerusalem was not captured. This outcome is significant, as it demonstrates God's protection over Judah, even during a time of unfaithfulness under Ahaz. The inability to conquer Jerusalem foreshadows the prophetic assurance given later in <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, where God promises deliverance to Ahaz through the sign of Immanuel.

In Kings the alliance between Rezin and Pekah is distinctly declared, as also the fact that they conjointly besieged Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>). From Chronicles we learn that, before the siege, Ahaz was twice defeated with great loss, once by the Syrians (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>), and once by the Israelites (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>). He was probably, therefore, reduced to great straits at the time when Isaiah received directions to seek an interview with him, and communicate to him a comforting message from Jehovah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Ahaz.</span> The reign of Ahaz covered, probably, the space between <span class="date">B.C. 743</span> and in <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>. The march on Jerusalem appears to have fallen somewhat late in his reign (about <span class="date">B.C. 733</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Rezin the King of Syria.</span> Rezin is mentioned as King of Damascus by Tiglath-Pfieser II. in several of his inscriptions. In one, which seems to belong to <span class="date">B.C. 732</span> or 731, he states that he defeated Rezin and slew him. <span class="cmt_word">Pekah the son of Remaliah</span> (see <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). Pekah had been an officer under Pekahiah, the son and successor of Menahem; but had revolted, put Pekahiah to death in his palace, and seized the crown. It is probable that he and Rezin were anxious to form a confederacy for the purpose of resisting the advance of the Assyrian power, and, distrusting Ahaz, desired to place on the throne of Judah a person on whom they could thoroughly depend (see ver. 6). It was not their design to conquer the Jewish kingdom, but only to change the sovereign. <span class="cmt_word">Toward Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to Jerusalem</span>. The allies reached the city and commenced the siege (<a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Could not prevail against it</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">prevailed not in fighting against it</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
