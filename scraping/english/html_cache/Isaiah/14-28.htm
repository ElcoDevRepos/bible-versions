King Ahaz was a ruler of Judah known for his idolatry and alliance with Assyria, which led to spiritual and political decline. His death marks a significant transition in Judah's history, as his son Hezekiah, who was more faithful to God, would succeed him. This period is crucial as it reflects a shift from a time of judgment to one of potential renewal and reform.<p><b>this burden was received:</b><br>The term "burden" refers to a prophetic oracle, often one of judgment or impending doom. In the context of Isaiah, burdens are messages from God delivered through the prophet, often concerning nations surrounding Israel and Judah. This particular burden is directed towards Philistia, a perennial enemy of Israel. The use of "received" indicates that the message is divinely inspired, emphasizing the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God's will. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God communicating His plans and judgments through chosen individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>Ahaz was the king of Judah, known for his idolatry and lack of faith in God.

Ahaz&#8217;s passing alters political dynamics, but above all it demonstrates that earthly thrones rise and fall under God&#8217;s rule. The &#8220;burden&#8221; Isaiah receives immediately turns to Philistia, warning them not to gloat over Judah&#8217;s change in leadership. For readers today, the verse underscores God&#8217;s perfect timing, His sovereignty over nations, and the reliability of His prophetic word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.</span>--The prophecies against Babylon and Assyria are naturally followed by a series of like predictions, dealing with other nations which played their part in the great drama of the time. The date of that which comes next in order is obviously specified, either by Isaiah himself or by the compiler of his prophecies, that it might be seen that it was not a prophecy after the event. The death-year of Ahaz was B.C. 727. It was natural that the prophet's thoughts should be much exercised then, as in the year of Uzziah's death (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>), on the uncertainties of the coming future, and the "burden" was the answer to his searchings of heart. It was probably delivered <span class= "ital">before </span>the king's death. (See Note on <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28-32.</span> - THE BURDEN OF PHILISTIA. The Philistines had suffered grievously at the hands of Judah in the reign of Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), and had retaliated in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). It would seem that after this they were invaded by Tiglath-Pileser, who penetrated as far as Gaza, which lie took ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 51) and made tributary, as he also did Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 399). Tiglath-Pileser died shortly before Ahaz, and the present "burden" seems to have been uttered in connection with his death. Isaiah warns Philistia (equivalent to "<span class="accented">Palestina"</span>) that her rejoicing is premature; Tiglath-Pileser will have successors as powerful and as cruel as himself, and these successors will carry destruction and ravage over the whole land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden</span>.
