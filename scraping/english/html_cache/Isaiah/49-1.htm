It indicates the universal scope of the message, suggesting that the prophecy is not just for Israel but for all nations. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all the earth, as seen in Psalms 97:1 and <a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>, where the coastlands wait for God's law.<p><b>pay attention, O distant peoples:</b><br>"Distant peoples" reinforces the idea of a global audience. This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of God's message and His concern for all humanity. It aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, highlighting the continuity of God's plan for salvation history.<p><b>The LORD called Me from the womb;</b><br>This indicates a divine calling and purpose established before birth, similar to the callings of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>) and Paul (<a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). It underscores the concept of predestination and God's foreknowledge.

The mention of being named from the mother's body suggests a specific and intentional role designated by God. This is reminiscent of Jesus being named before His birth (<a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>), indicating His mission as Savior.
