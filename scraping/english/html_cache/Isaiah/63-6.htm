The act of trampling signifies complete domination and destruction, often used in prophetic literature to describe God's judgment against sin and rebellion. The nations represent those who oppose God's will, and this imagery is consistent with other biblical passages such as <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where Christ is depicted as treading the winepress of God's wrath. Historically, this reflects the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions, where God used foreign nations as instruments of judgment against Israel and other nations.<p><b>in My wrath I made them drunk</b><br>The metaphor of making the nations drunk with wrath suggests overwhelming them with divine judgment, leading to confusion and downfall. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-16</a>, where the nations drink the cup of God's wrath and stagger. The concept of divine retribution is central here, emphasizing that God's judgment is both righteous and inevitable. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often associated drunkenness with loss of control and impending doom, reinforcing the severity of God's actions.<p><b>and poured out their blood on the ground.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase signifies the complete and utter defeat of the nations, with their blood symbolizing life being violently taken away. The pouring out of blood on the ground is a vivid depiction of death and destruction, reminiscent of sacrificial imagery where blood is poured out as an offering. In the context of Isaiah, it underscores the seriousness of God's judgment against sin. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as seen in <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>, where the blood flows from the winepress of God's wrath. Theologically, it foreshadows the sacrificial death of Christ, whose blood was poured out for the redemption of humanity, contrasting the judgment here with the grace offered through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, representing divine judgment and wrath against the nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations that opposed God and His people, symbolizing those who are against God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message to the people of Israel, providing both warnings and hope.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/63.htm">Isaiah 63</a> includes Edom as a symbol of God's enemies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_vengeance.htm">The Day of Vengeance</a></b><br>A prophetic event where God executes judgment on His enemies, demonstrating His justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_wrath.htm">Understanding Divine Wrath</a></b><br>God's wrath is a response to sin and rebellion.

The verse foreshadows Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/bsb/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>), assures believers of God&#8217;s ultimate victory, and warns every soul that refusing His grace results in inevitable, literal judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/63.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">I will tread down . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I trod; </span>and so throughout the verse.<p><span class= "bld">Make them drunk, </span>implies a change of imagery from that of the battle to that of the cup of wrath, as in <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15</a>. The section which thus closes has often been applied (as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the Prayer-Book Epistle for the Monday before Easter) to the passion of our Lord. In that agony and death it has been said He was alone, and none was with Him. He trod the winepress of the wrath of God. It is obvious, however, that this, though we may legitimately apply some of Isaiah's phrases to it, is not an interpretation of this passage, which paints a victory, and not a passion. The true analogue in the New Testament is that of the victory of the triumphant Christ in <a href="/context/revelation/19-11.htm" title="And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war.">Revelation 19:11-13</a>; but it may be conceded that, from one point of view, the agony and the cross were themselves a conflict with the powers of evil (<a href="/context/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31-32</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>), and that as He came out of that conflict as a conqueror, the words in which Isaiah paints the victor over Edom may, though in a much remoter analogy, be applicable to Him in that conflict also. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will tread down... make drunk ... bring down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I trode down</span>... <span class="accented">made drunk</span>... <span class="accented">brought down.</span> See the comment on ver. 3.
