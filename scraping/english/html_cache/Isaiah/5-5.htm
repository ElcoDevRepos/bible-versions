The vineyard represents the house of Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>. The imagery of a vineyard is common in Scripture, symbolizing God's people and His care for them (<a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>). The owner of the vineyard, God, is about to take action due to the unfruitfulness and rebellion of His people.<p><b>I will take away its hedge,</b><br>The hedge symbolizes protection and divine favor. In ancient times, vineyards were often surrounded by hedges or walls to protect them from animals and thieves. Removing the hedge indicates the withdrawal of God's protection, leaving the vineyard vulnerable. This reflects the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness.<p><b>and it will be consumed;</b><br>The consumption of the vineyard signifies destruction and desolation. This can be seen as a prophetic warning of the coming invasions and exiles that Israel would face, particularly by the Assyrians and Babylonians. The imagery of consumption also points to the spiritual decay and moral corruption that had overtaken the nation, leading to its downfall.<p><b>I will tear down its wall,</b><br>The wall, like the hedge, represents security and separation from external threats. Tearing down the wall indicates a complete exposure to danger and judgment. This act is reminiscent of the destruction of Jerusalem and its walls by the Babylonians in 586 BC, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>. It serves as a metaphor for the removal of divine protection due to persistent sin.<p><b>and it will be trampled.</b><br>Trampling suggests utter devastation and humiliation. This imagery is consistent with the fate of a neglected vineyard, overrun and destroyed. It also foreshadows the trampling of Jerusalem by foreign powers, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a> and fulfilled in various historical invasions. The trampling is a consequence of Israel's failure to uphold their covenant with God, highlighting the seriousness of their spiritual apostasy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book and serves as God's messenger to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of the nation of Israel, the vineyard represents God's chosen people whom He has nurtured and protected.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, God is depicted as the owner of the vineyard, expressing His judgment and disappointment over Israel's unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, representing the southern kingdom of Israel during a time of moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hedge_and_wall.htm">The Hedge and Wall</a></b><br>Metaphors for God's protection and provision for Israel, which He threatens to remove due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_expectation_of_fruitfulness.htm">God's Expectation of Fruitfulness</a></b><br>God expects His people to bear spiritual fruit, reflecting His character and purposes.

The &#8220;vineyard&#8221; is plainly identified in <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a> as &#8220;the house of Israel,&#8221; and Jesus echoes this imagery in <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>. The announcement underscores that privilege brings accountability (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>). Just as <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-11</a> celebrates God&#8217;s past care for His vine, the present verse prepares the listener for the sober reality that protection is not unconditional.<p>&#8226; The personal pronoun &#8220;My&#8221; reminds Israel of covenant ownership (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;What I am about to do&#8221; reveals imminent, purposeful action; God&#8217;s judgments never stem from caprice (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The coming steps are disciplinary, yet still aimed at driving repentance, echoing <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will take away its hedge, and it will be consumed;</b><p>A hedge was a thick living barrier guarding a vineyard (<a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>). Removing it means lifting divine protection so that external forces can reach the vine unchecked. <a href="/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a> laments, &#8220;Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?&#8221; The language is literal: invading armies would indeed devour the land, as Assyria did to the Northern Kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>) and Babylon later did to Judah (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Without the hedge, grazing animals and marauders freely &#8220;consume,&#8221; picturing total loss (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice allows consequences to run their course (<a href="/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>), yet His sovereignty still frames the process (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The thought carries forward into New-Covenant warnings that persistent unfruitfulness invites pruning (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will tear down its wall, and it will be trampled.</b><p>Beyond the hedge, vineyards often had a stone wall (<a href="/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>). Tearing it down means dismantling every remaining safeguard, ensuring the land is &#8220;trampled&#8221; under hostile feet (<a href="/lamentations/1-10.htm">Lamentations 1:10</a>). In history, Jerusalem&#8217;s walls fell to Babylon in 586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>). In prophecy, this anticipates yet-future judgments as well (<a href="/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Trampled&#8221; conveys humiliation and ruin (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>), reversing Israel&#8217;s high calling to be &#8220;a crown of beauty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/62-3.htm">Isaiah 62:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture parallels <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-26</a>, where God &#8220;gives over&#8221; those who resist Him.<p>&#8226; Still, God leaves room for restoration; Nehemiah&#8217;s rebuilding of Jerusalem&#8217;s walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>) shows that chastisement is not His final word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a> presents a three-step judgment: God announces His action, removes protective hedges, and dismantles defensive walls, leaving His vineyard to destructive trampling. The verse teaches that divine privilege demands fruitfulness; when God&#8217;s people persist in rebellion, He literally withdraws protection so consequences can awaken repentance. Yet even in judgment, His goal remains redemptive, pointing forward to restoration for all who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">I will take away the hedge . . .</span>--This involved the throwing open of the vineyard to be as grazing land which all the wild bulls of Bashan--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>all the enemies of Zion--might trample on (<a href="/ezekiel/34-18.htm" title="Seems it a small thing to you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?">Ezekiel 34:18</a>). The interpretation of the parable implies that there was to be the obliteration, at least for some time and in some measure, of the distinctness and independence of the nation's life. (Comp. <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>, for a like sentence in another form.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now go to; I will tell you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and now</span>, <span class="accented">I pray you</span>, <span class="accented">let me tell yon</span>. The address is still smooth and persuasive up to the word "vineyard." Then there is a sudden change; the style becomes abrupt, the tone fierce and menacing. "Let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: break down its hedge, that it be grazed on; destroy its wall, that it be trampled underfoot," etc. <span class="cmt_word">The hedge... the wall</span>. Vine-yards were usually protected either by a hedge of thorns, commonly of the prickly pear, or else by a wall; but the rabbis say that in some cases, for additional security, they were surrounded by both.
