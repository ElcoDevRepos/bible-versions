"In that day" is a common prophetic term used throughout the Old Testament to denote a future time when God will act decisively. The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority and power, often associated with His role as a divine warrior leading heavenly armies. This sets the stage for a significant event orchestrated by God.<p><b>the peg driven into a firm place will give way;</b><br>The imagery of a "peg" suggests stability and security, often used metaphorically for leaders or key figures in a community. In ancient Near Eastern culture, tents were secured with pegs, symbolizing something or someone that holds a structure together. The prophecy indicates that what was once considered stable and reliable will fail. This can be seen as a warning against placing trust in human leaders or institutions rather than in God.<p><b>it will be sheared off and fall,</b><br>The action of being "sheared off" and falling suggests a sudden and complete removal. This could symbolize the downfall of a leader or a collapse of a system that was once thought to be unshakeable. Historically, this may refer to the fall of Shebna, a steward in King Hezekiah's court, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/isaiah/22.htm">Isaiah 22</a>. The imagery underscores the fragility of human power when it stands against divine will.<p><b>and the load upon it will be cut down.&#8221;</b><br>The "load" represents the responsibilities, burdens, or people dependent on the peg. When the peg falls, everything relying on it is also affected. This highlights the interconnectedness of leadership and those they lead. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of misplaced trust and the inevitable failure of human systems without God's support.<p><b>Indeed, the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This final phrase affirms the certainty and authority of the prophecy. When God speaks, His words are definitive and unchangeable. It reassures the reader of the truth and reliability of the message, emphasizing that the events described are not merely predictions but are decreed by God Himself. This underscores the theme of divine sovereignty throughout the passage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

Here, as in the case of Shebna, we have no record of the fulfilment of the prediction, but it is a natural inference, from its remaining in the collected prophecies of Isaiah, either that it was fulfilled, or that it did its work as a warning, and that the penalty was averted by a timely reformation.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - SEQUEL OF THE PROPHECY CONCERNING ELIAKIM. This verse has been truly called "an enigma" (Kay). It is impossible to understand it of Shebna. "The nail that was fastened in a sure place" can only refer to the nail said to have been so fastened in ver. 23. Are we, then, to understand that Eliakim too will experience a reverse of fortune? But then all the force of the contrast between him and Shebna would be gone. Is it not possible that the prophet, seeing in Eliakim a type of the Messiah, and becoming more and more Messianic in his utterances, has ended by forgetting the type altogether, and being absorbed in the thought of the antitype? He, the nail, so surely fixed in his eternal place, would nevertheless be "removed" for a time, and then "he cut down and fall" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>).
