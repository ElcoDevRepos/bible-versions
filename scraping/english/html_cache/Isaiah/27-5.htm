In the context of Isaiah, this is a call to the people of Israel to turn back to God amidst their trials and tribulations. Historically, Israel often found itself surrounded by hostile nations, and God's protection was a recurring theme in their survival. This invitation echoes the covenant relationship God established with Israel, where He promised to be their protector if they remained faithful (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate protection offered through Jesus Christ, who provides spiritual protection and salvation to believers (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<p><b>let them make peace with Me&#8212;</b><br>The call to make peace with God implies a need for reconciliation due to estrangement caused by sin. In the historical context of Isaiah, Israel's disobedience and idolatry had led to a broken relationship with God. Making peace involves repentance and returning to God's ways. This concept is consistent throughout the Bible, where peace with God is achieved through repentance and faith (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). In the New Testament, this peace is fully realized through Jesus Christ, who reconciles humanity to God (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><b>yes, let them make peace with Me.&#8221;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the importance and urgency of reconciliation with God. It underscores God's desire for His people to return to Him and the assurance that peace is possible. This reflects God's character as patient and merciful, willing to forgive and restore those who seek Him (<a href="/psalms/86-5.htm">Psalm 86:5</a>). Theologically, this points to the New Covenant established through Jesus, where peace with God is accessible to all who believe (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-18</a>). The double mention of making peace highlights the certainty and sincerity of God's offer of reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, offering protection and peace to those who seek Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Isaiah's prophecy, often depicted as a vineyard in this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>Implicit in the context, those who oppose God's people and need to seek peace with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet delivering God's message, calling for reconciliation and peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of Israel, representing God's people and His care for them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/invitation_to_reconciliation.htm">Invitation to Reconciliation</a></b><br>God extends an invitation to all to seek His protection and make peace with Him.

There is another alternative. If the "thorns and the briars" are not prepared to contend in battle against God, let them adopt a different course. Let them "lay hold of God's strength," place themselves under his protection, and make their appeal to him, and see if they cannot "make their peace with him." A truly evangelical invitation! The enemies of God are entreated to cease from striving against him, and are taught that the door of repentance is still open to them. God is willing to be reconciled even to his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Let them make peace with him, make peace with him</span>. The reiteration constitutes an appeal of extreme earnestness and tenderness, which none could reject but the utterly impenitent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/27-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Or</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1434;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let them lay claim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2388.htm">Strong's 2388: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fasten upon, to seize, be strong, obstinate, to bind, restrain, conquer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to My protection;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;z&#183;z&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
