In the Hebrew context, "wait" implies an active hope and expectation. The Israelites, during their Babylonian exile, were encouraged to trust in God's timing for deliverance. This concept is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, which encourages believers to wait for the Lord with courage. The idea of waiting on the Lord is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, highlighting the virtue of faith and reliance on God's promises.<p><b>will renew their strength;</b><br>The promise of renewed strength is significant for those who feel weary and burdened. In the historical context, the Israelites were physically and spiritually exhausted from exile. The renewal of strength is not just physical but also spiritual, symbolizing a restoration of hope and vigor. This renewal is a divine gift, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>, where the inner self is renewed day by day. It reflects the transformative power of God's presence in the lives of believers.<p><b>they will mount up with wings like eagles;</b><br>Eagles are known for their strength and ability to soar high above the earth, symbolizing freedom and perspective. In the ancient Near East, the eagle was a symbol of power and might. This imagery suggests that those who trust in the Lord will rise above their circumstances with divine assistance. The metaphor of the eagle is also used in <a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>, where God describes carrying the Israelites on eagles' wings, signifying deliverance and protection.<p><b>they will run and not grow weary,</b><br>Running without growing weary signifies endurance and perseverance. In the cultural context, running was often associated with messengers or warriors who needed stamina to complete their tasks. This promise assures believers that God will provide the necessary strength to endure life's challenges. <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a> encourages believers to run with perseverance the race marked out for them, fixing their eyes on Jesus, the ultimate source of strength.<p><b>they will walk and not faint.</b><br>Walking without fainting represents steady progress and continual faithfulness. In biblical times, walking was the primary mode of transportation, requiring endurance over long distances. This phrase assures believers that God will sustain them in their daily walk, providing the strength needed for life's journey. <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> echoes this sentiment, urging believers not to grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time, they will reap a harvest if they do not give up.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
