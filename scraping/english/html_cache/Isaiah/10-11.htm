The Assyrians, under King Sargon II, destroyed the city and exiled its inhabitants. Samaria's downfall was attributed to its idolatry and abandonment of the covenant with Yahweh. The reference to "idols" highlights the spiritual apostasy that led to its destruction. This serves as a warning to Judah, emphasizing that idolatry leads to divine judgment. The historical context underscores the Assyrian policy of deportation and resettlement, which aimed to prevent rebellion by mixing populations.<p><b>will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols?&#8221;</b><br>Here, the speaker, representing Assyria, arrogantly assumes that Jerusalem will suffer the same fate as Samaria. This reflects the Assyrian belief in their invincibility and the power of their gods over the God of Israel. However, this statement is also prophetic, as it foreshadows the eventual Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC due to similar sins of idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. The mention of "idols" in Jerusalem indicates that Judah, like Israel, had fallen into idolatry, despite the presence of the temple. This phrase serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. Theologically, it points to the need for a faithful remnant and the ultimate hope of restoration through the Messiah, who would purify and restore true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire used by God as an instrument of judgment against Israel and Judah.

He treats his earlier conquests as proof that future ones are inevitable. Scripture records the same arrogant spirit in <a href="/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>, where the Assyrian envoy taunts Judah: &#8220;Has the god of any nation delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?&#8221; The literal history in <a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a> confirms that Assyria had already swept through the region, so the boast is grounded in real events&#8212;even while revealing pride that God will soon judge (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Samaria</b><p>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. In 722 BC it fell to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The statement reminds Judah that their northern relatives, once confident in their fortified hill and rich culture, were powerless against the Assyrian machine. By citing Samaria, the king presents a chilling precedent: &#8220;If your sister city couldn&#8217;t stand, why do you think you will?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its idols,</b><p>The northern kingdom was steeped in idolatry from its founding (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a> with Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves). <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16-18</a> lists their carved images, astral worship, child sacrifice, and sorcery, ending with God&#8217;s verdict: &#8220;So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from His presence.&#8221; Assyria assumes victory was proof that Samaria&#8217;s gods were weak, but Isaiah lets us see the deeper truth: the LORD used Assyria to discipline a people who had forsaken Him (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will I not also do</b><p>This is a rhetorical question dripping with overconfidence. The king treats all nations&#8212;and their deities&#8212;as interchangeable trophies. His logic: past conquest guarantees future conquest. Yet the very breath he uses to boast is under God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). <a href="/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26-27</a> later records the LORD confronting this mindset: &#8220;Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it.&#8221; Assyria is merely a tool; God alone decides how far the axe may swing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jerusalem</b><p>Jerusalem, center of the southern kingdom of Judah, is now in the crosshairs. In 701 BC Sennacherib surrounded the city (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36&#8211;37</a>), but God intervened, sending the angel of the LORD to strike down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>). The boast in chapter 10 therefore stands as both a threat and a test: will Jerusalem trust in political maneuvering, or in the covenant-keeping God who &#8220;dwells between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and her idols?</b><p>Although Judah retained the temple, idolatry still infected the land (<a href="/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1-9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-5.htm">Ezekiel 8:5-12</a>). The Assyrian king assumes Judah&#8217;s gods are no better than Samaria&#8217;s. Ironically, this taunt exposes Judah&#8217;s hidden compromise: statues remained in high places, and many citizens blended pagan rituals with temple worship (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30-31</a>). God would spare Jerusalem from Assyria, yet a century later Babylon would burn the city because the people clung to those very idols (<a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a> captures an Assyrian king boasting that Jerusalem will fall just as Samaria did. He points to his past destruction of an idolatrous city as proof of future triumph. Yet Isaiah shows that:<p>&#8226; Assyria&#8217;s success was ordained by God, not its own strength.<p>&#8226; Samaria fell because of idolatry, fulfilling God&#8217;s warnings.<p>&#8226; Jerusalem faced the same danger: trust idols and perish, or trust the LORD and live.<p>The verse stands as a sober reminder: God&#8217;s Word is historically accurate, morally absolute, and personally urgent. When prideful powers threaten, the decisive factor is never their might but our fidelity to the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Shall I not, as I have done . . .</span>--The verse gives the occasion of Isaiah's utterance. Sargon was threatening Jerusalem, probably in the early years of Hezekiah's reign. The inscriptions show, as <a href="/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1</a> also does, that he made war against Philistia and besieged Ashdod (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, vii.</span> 40).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I not... so do to Jerusalem and her idols</span>? The speaker ignores the fact of any difference in kind between the religion of Judaea and that of the neighboring countries. He speaks as if he knew nothing of any religion without idols. No doubt Assyrian ideas on the subject of the religion of the Jews were at this time, as they were even later (<a href="/2_kings/18-22.htm">2 Kings 18:22</a>), exceedingly vague and incorrect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
