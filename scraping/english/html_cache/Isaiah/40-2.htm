Jerusalem, representing the people of Israel, is addressed with compassion. The use of "tenderly" suggests a deep, heartfelt communication, reflecting God's love and mercy. Historically, Jerusalem had faced destruction and exile, but this message promises restoration. The city is often personified in Scripture, symbolizing the spiritual state of the nation (<a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>, <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>).<p><b>and proclaim to her that her forced labor has been completed;</b><br>The "forced labor" refers to the period of exile and suffering experienced by the Israelites, particularly during the Babylonian captivity. This phrase signifies the end of their punishment and the beginning of a new era of freedom. Theologically, it points to God's sovereignty in determining the duration of discipline and His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>).<p><b>her iniquity has been pardoned.</b><br>This declaration of pardon indicates a divine act of forgiveness. In the Old Testament, iniquity often required atonement through sacrifice, but here it is freely pardoned by God. This foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness through Jesus Christ, who provides atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). The concept of pardon is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>).<p><b>For she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.</b><br>The phrase "double for all her sins" can be understood as receiving a full measure of punishment, emphasizing the completeness of God's justice. It also suggests that the punishment was sufficient and that restoration is now possible. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>) and highlights God's righteousness. The "hand of the LORD" signifies His direct involvement and control over the events, underscoring His authority and the certainty of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, often representing the people of God.

After long seasons of judgment, He does not wait for Israel to find the right words; He supplies them. Compare <a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>, &#8220;Comfort, comfort My people...&#8221; and <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>, where the LORD answers the angel &#8220;with gracious and comforting words.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Tenderly&#8221; points to the heart, recalling <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>, where God allures His wayward people into the wilderness to &#8220;speak comfort&#8221; to them.<p>&#8226; The tone previews Christ&#8217;s own gentleness (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). Just as Jesus calls the weary to rest, the prophetic voice calls the exiles home.<p>&#8226; Application: whenever God&#8217;s people have felt disciplined or distant, His first word back is still comfort&#8212;never condemnation without hope (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Proclaim to her that her forced labor has been completed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and proclaim to her that her forced labor has been completed&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forced labor&#8221; pictures the seventy-year Babylonian exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). The hard service is over; the prison doors are open (<a href="/lamentations/4-22.htm">Lamentations 4:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This literally happened when Cyrus permitted the Jews to return (<a href="/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). The prophecy is history.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it foreshadows the greater emancipation announced by Jesus: &#8220;He has sent Me to proclaim liberty to the captives&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God keeps exact accounts. When the time of discipline ends, it ends&#8212;no extra day is added (<a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her iniquity has been pardoned</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;her iniquity has been pardoned.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pardon means the debt is cancelled, not merely reduced.

God never overlooks sin; He covers it (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For every believer, this finds its climax at the cross: &#8220;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the order: God removes the burden (labor) and erases the record (iniquity). He deals with both consequence and cause.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins</b><p>&#8220;For she has received from the hand of the LORD double for all her sins.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Double&#8221; echoes the Old Testament principle of restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4</a>).

He speaks gently, declares the exile finished, pardons guilt, and acknowledges that just discipline has run its full course. Historically fulfilled in the return from Babylon, the verse also foreshadows the gospel&#8212;where Jesus ends our slavery to sin, secures full forgiveness, and turns divine indignation into lasting comfort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Speak ye comfortably . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Speak ye to the heart. </span>The command is addressed to the prophets whom Isaiah contemplates as working towards the close of the exile, and carrying on his work. In <a href="/haggai/1-13.htm" title="Then spoke Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.">Haggai 1:13</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm" title="The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.">Haggai 2:9</a>, and <a href="/zechariah/1-13.htm" title="And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.">Zechariah 1:13</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/2-5.htm" title="For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.">Zechariah 2:5-10</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9-12</a>, we may rightly trace the influence of the words as working out their own fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">That her warfare is accomplished.</span>--The time of war, with all its suffering, becomes the symbol of sufferings apart from actual war. The exile was one long campaign with enemies who were worse than the Babylonian conquerors. In <a href="/job/7-1.htm" title="Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?">Job 7:1</a>; <a href="/job/14-14.htm" title="If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.">Job 14:14</a>, the word is applied (rendered by "appointed time") to the battle of life from its beginning to its end. This, too, may be noted as one of the many parallelisms between Isaiah and Job. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem</span>; literally, <span class="accented">speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem.</span> Address her inmost feelings, her very spirit and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Her warfare is accomplished... is pardoned... hath received</span>. These perfects can only be viewed as "perfects of prophetic certainty." According to every theory of the authorship of <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-46</a>, they were written before the close of the Captivity, when Israel's warfare was not yet accomplished, her iniquity not yet fully pardoned. Isaiah, however, sees all as already accomplished in the Divine counsels, and so announces it to the people. Israel's warfare, her long term of hard service (comp. <a href="/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>), will assuredly come to an end; she will thoroughly turn to God, and then her iniquity will be pardoned, she will be considered to have suffered enough. Double. "It was the ordinary rule under the Law that 'for all manner of trespass' a man condemned by the judges should pay double" (Kay; comp. <a href="/exodus/22-9.htm">Exodus 22:9</a>). Heathen legislators adopted the same rule for certain offences (Arist, 'Eth. Nic.,' 3:5, &sect; 8). It is not here intended to assert that the law of Divine judgment is to exact double; but only to assure Israel that, having been amply punished, she need fear no further vengeance (comp. <a href="/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/40-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tenderly to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jerusalem,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1460;&#1433;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and proclaim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
