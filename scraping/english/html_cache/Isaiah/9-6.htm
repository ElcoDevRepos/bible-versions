It connects to the prophecy of a virgin birth in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, where a child named Immanuel is foretold. The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem fulfills this prophecy, as recorded in <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22-23</a>. The phrase underscores the incarnation, where God takes on human flesh, a central tenet of Christian theology.<p><b>unto us a son is given</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the divine nature of the Messiah, as a "son" given by God. It reflects the concept of Jesus as the Son of God, a gift to humanity. <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> echoes this sentiment, highlighting God's love in giving His only Son. The dual nature of Christ, both human and divine, is a cornerstone of Christian belief.<p><b>and the government will be upon His shoulders</b><br>This phrase indicates the Messiah's role as a ruler and king. It suggests a future time when He will establish His reign, bringing justice and peace. The imagery of bearing the government on His shoulders signifies authority and responsibility. This connects to the Davidic Covenant in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises an everlasting kingdom through David's lineage, fulfilled in Jesus.<p><b>And He will be called Wonderful Counselor</b><br>The title "Wonderful Counselor" suggests wisdom and guidance beyond human understanding. It implies that the Messiah will provide divine counsel and direction. In the New Testament, Jesus is often depicted as a teacher and guide, offering wisdom through His parables and teachings. This title reflects His role in providing spiritual guidance and insight.<p><b>Mighty God</b><br>This title affirms the deity of the Messiah, identifying Him as God Himself. It aligns with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, where Jesus is recognized as fully God. The term "Mighty" conveys strength and power, attributes of God seen throughout the Old Testament. This title underscores the belief in Jesus' divine authority and power.<p><b>Everlasting Father</b><br>This title can be understood as the Messiah's eternal nature and His role as a fatherly figure to His people. It does not imply that the Son is the Father in the Trinitarian sense but rather highlights His care, protection, and eternal existence. The concept of God as a father is prevalent in scripture, offering comfort and assurance of His unending presence.<p><b>Prince of Peace</b><br>The title "Prince of Peace" signifies the Messiah's role in bringing peace to the world. It reflects the peace that Jesus offers through reconciliation with God, as seen in <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>. This peace is both spiritual and eschatological, pointing to a future time when Christ will establish His kingdom of peace on earth, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's prophecies often pointed to the coming of the Messiah and the future hope for Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child/son.htm">The Child/Son</a></b><br>This refers to the prophesied Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is both fully human ("a child is born") and fully divine ("a son is given").<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_government.htm">The Government</a></b><br>Symbolizes the authority and rule that the Messiah will have, indicating a kingdom characterized by justice and peace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonderful_counselor.htm">Wonderful Counselor</a></b><br>A title for the Messiah, emphasizing His wisdom and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_god,_everlasting_father,_prince_of_peace.htm">Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace</a></b><br>Titles that reflect the divine nature and eternal reign of the Messiah, highlighting His power, care, and the peace He brings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dual_nature_of_christ.htm">The Dual Nature of Christ</a></b><br>Recognize the significance of Jesus being both fully human and fully divine, which is essential for His role as Savior.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_jesus_as_counselor.htm">The Role of Jesus as Counselor</a></b><br>Seek Jesus' wisdom and guidance in daily life, trusting in His perfect counsel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_authority.htm">Understanding Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>Acknowledge Jesus' sovereign rule over all aspects of life and submit to His leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/experiencing_peace_through_christ.htm">Experiencing Peace through Christ</a></b><br>Embrace the peace that Jesus offers, which surpasses all understanding, especially in times of turmoil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Remember that Jesus' reign is everlasting, providing hope and assurance for the future.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_9_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 9:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_6_Jesus_divinity_kingship.htm">How does Isaiah 9:6 reveal Jesus' divine nature and eternal kingship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_9_6_titles_on_Jesus_character.htm">What do the titles in Isaiah 9:6 teach about Jesus' character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Prince_of_Peace_to_conflicts.htm">How can we apply "Prince of Peace" to our daily conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Isaiah_9_6_to_Jesus_birth_mission.htm">Connect Isaiah 9:6 with New Testament references to Jesus' birth and mission.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Wonderful_Counselor_guide_us.htm">How does "Wonderful Counselor" guide us in making godly decisions today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_9_6_foretell_Jesus.htm">How does Isaiah 9:6 predict the coming of Jesus as the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_child_in_Isaiah_9_6_called_God.htm">Why is the child in Isaiah 9:6 called "Mighty God" and "Everlasting Father"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Isaiah_9_6.htm">What historical context surrounds the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_you_truly_the_son_of_god.htm">Are you truly the Son of God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_isaiah_9_imply_jesus'_prophecy.htm">What evidence exists that Isaiah 9 uniquely prophesies Jesus, given that the text never names him explicitly?

Every title answers a human need, and every need drives us back to Him. Trust the Child given, submit to the King enthroned, and walk in the peace only He supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">For unto us a child is born.</span>--The picture of a kingdom of peace could not be complete without the manifestation of a king. In the description of that king Isaiah is led to use words which cannot find a complete fulfilment in any child of man. The loftiness of thought, rising here as to its highest point, is obviously connected with the words which told that Jehovah had spoken to the prophet "with a strong hand." His condition was one more ecstatic and therefore more apocalyptic than before, and there flashes on him, as it were, the thought that the future deliverer of Israel must bear a name that should be above every name that men had before honoured. And yet here also there was a law of continuity, and the form of the prediction was developed from the materials supplied by earlier prophets. In Psalms 110 he had found the thought of the king-priest after the order of Melchizedek, whom Jehovah addressed as Adonai. In Psalms 2, though it did not foretell an actual incarnation, the anointed King was addressed by Jehovah as His Son. The throne of that righteous king was as a throne of God (<a href="/psalms/45-6.htm" title="Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of your kingdom is a right scepter.">Psalm 45:6</a>). Nor had the prophet's personal experience been less fruitfully suggestive. He had given his own children mysterious names. That of the earthly Immanuel, as the prophet brooded over it, might well lead on to the thought of One who should, in a yet higher sense than as being the pledge of Divine protection, be as "God with us." Even the earthly surroundings of the prophet's life may not have been without their share of suggestiveness. The kings of Egypt and Assyria with whom his nation had been brought into contact delighted in long lists of epithetic names (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>"the great king, the king unrivalled, the protector of the just, the noble warrior." Inscription of, Sennacherib in <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, i.</span> p. 25), describing their greatness and their glory. It was natural that the prophet should see in the king of whom he thought as the future conqueror of all the world-powers that were founded on might and not on right, One who should bear a name formed, it might be, after that fashion, but full of a greater majesty and glory.<p><span class= "bld">His name shall be called Wonderful.</span>--It is noticeable that that which follows is given not as many names, but one. Consisting as it does of eight words, of which the last six obviously fall into three couplets, it is probable that the first two should also be taken together, and that we have four elements of the compound name: (1) <span class= "ital">Wonderful-Counsellor, </span>(2) <span class= "ital">God-the-Mighty-One, </span>(3) <span class= "ital">Father of Eternity, </span>(4) <span class= "ital">Prince of Peace. </span>Each element of the Name has its special significance. (1) The first embodies the thought of the wisdom of the future Messiah. Men should not simply praise it as they praise their fellows, but should adore and wonder at it as they wonder at the wisdom of God (<a href="/judges/13-18.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?">Judges 13:18</a>, where the Hebrew for the "secret" of the Authorised version is the same as that for "wonderful;" <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm" title="I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember your wonders of old.">Psalm 77:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-11.htm" title="And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.">Psalm 78:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm" title="This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.">Isaiah 28:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.">Isaiah 29:14</a>). The name contains the germ afterwards developed in the picture of the wisdom of the true king in <a href="/context/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2-4</a>. The LXX. renders the Hebrew as "the angel of great counsel," and in the Vatican text the description ends there. (2) It is significant that the word for "God" is not Elohim, which may be used in a lower sense for those who are representatives of God, as in <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.">Exodus 7:1</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/28-13.htm" title="And the king said to her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.">1Samuel 28:13</a>, but <span class= "ital">El, </span>which is never used by Isaiah, or any other Old Testament writer, in any lower sense than that of absolute Deity, and which, we may note, had been specially brought before the prophet's thoughts in the name Immanuel. The name appears again as applied directly to Jehovah in <a href="/isaiah/10-21.htm" title="The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.">Isaiah 10:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm" title="For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm" title="You show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-32.htm" title="Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keep covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.">Nehemiah 9:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm" title="Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.">Psalm 24:8</a>; and the adjective in <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm" title="The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.">Isaiah 42:13</a>. (3) In "Father of Eternity," (LXX. Alex. and Vulg., "Father of the age to come ") we have a name which seems at first to clash with the formalised developments of Christian theology, which teach us, lest we should "confound the persons," not to deal with the names of the Father and the Son as interchangeable. Those developments, however, were obviously not within Isaiah's ken, and he uses the name of "Father" because none other expressed so well the true idea of loving and protecting government (<a href="/job/29-16.htm" title="I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.">Job 29:16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/22-21.htm" title="And I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your girdle, and I will commit your government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.">Isaiah 22:21</a>). And if the kingdom was to be "for ever and ever," then in some very real sense he would be, in that attribute of Fatherly government, a sharer in the eternity of Jehovah. Another rendering of the name, adopted by some critics, "Father (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Giver) of booty," has little to recommend it, and is entirely out of harmony with the majesty of the context. (4) "Prince of Peace." The prophet clings, as all prophets before him had done, to the thought that peace, and not war, belonged to the ideal Kingdom of the Messiah. That hope had been embodied by David in the name of Absalom (" father of peace ") and Solomon. It had been uttered in the prayer of <a href="/psalms/72-3.htm" title="The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.">Psalm 72:3</a>, and by Isaiah's contemporary, Micah (<a href="/micah/5-5.htm" title="And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.">Micah 5:5</a>). Earth-powers, like Assyria and Egypt, might rest in war and conquest as an end, but the true king, though warfare might be needed to subdue his foes (<a href="/psalms/45-5.htm" title="Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under you.">Psalm 45:5</a>), was to be a "Prince of Peace" (<a href="/context/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9-10</a>). It must be noted as remarkable, looking to the grandeur of the prophecy, and its apparently direct testimony to the true nature of the Christ, that it is nowhere cited in the New Testament as fulfilled in Him; and this, though <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm" title="Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.">Isaiah 9:1</a> is, as we have seen, quoted by St. Matthew and <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm" title="Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.">Isaiah 9:7</a>, finds at least an allusive reference in <a href="/context/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32-33</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto us a child is born</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14-16</a>, where the promise of "a child," "a son," is first made - a child who was, like this Child, to be "God with us"). <span class="cmt_word">The government shall be upon his shoulder.</span> The word translated "government" (<span class="accented">misrah</span>) occurs only here and in ver. 7. It is probably to be connected with <span class="accented">sat</span>, "prince," and Israel. Government was regarded as a burden, to be born on the back or shoulders, and was sometimes symbolized by a key laid upon the shoulder (<a href="/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a>). Vizier means "burdened." The Latin writers often speak of the civil power as borne on the shoulders of magistrates (Cic., 'Orat. pro Flacc,' &sect; 95; Plin., 'Paneg.,' &sect; 10). As God, our Lord governed all things from the beginning; as man, he set up a "kingdom" which he still governs - upon the earth. <span class="cmt_word">His name shall be called.</span> It is perhaps not very important whether we view what follows as one name or several. Isaiah does not really mean that the "Child" should bear <span class="accented">as</span> a name, or names, any of the expressions, but only that they should be truly applicable to him. <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful, Counselor</span>. It has been proposed to unite these two expressions and translate, "Wondrous Counselor" (compare "wonderful in counsel," <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>). But Dr. Kay is probably right in saying that, if this had been the meaning, it would have been expressed differently. Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, and Vance Smith agree with Dr. Kay in taking the words separately. <span class="accented">Wonderful</span>. The Messiah would be "wonderful" in his nature as God-Man; in his teaching, which "astonished" those who heard it (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>); in his doings (<a href="/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>); in the circumstances of his birth and death; in his resurrection, and in his ascension. "Wonder" would be the first sentiment which his manifestation would provoke, and hence this descriptive epithet is placed first. As the Word, as Wisdom itself, as he who says, "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am Understanding" (<a href="/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>), he is well named "Counselor." None will ever seek his counsel in vain, much less repent of following it. <span class="cmt_word">The mighty God</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">Mighty God</span>; but the difference is not great, since <span class="accented">El</span>, God, contains within itself the notion of singularity, which is given to ordinary nouns by the article. The term <span class="accented">El</span>, God, had been previously applied to the Messiah only in <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. It denotes in Isaiah always (as Mr. Cheyne observes) "divinity in an absolute sense; it is never used hyperbolically or metaphorically." <span class="cmt_word">The Everlasting Father</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Everlasting</span> or <span class="accented">Eternal Father</span>. But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal? If the term "Father," applied to our Lord, grates on our ears, we must remember that the distinction of Persons in the Godhead had not yet been revealed. <span class="cmt_word">The Prince of Peace</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Prince of Peace</span>. A "Prince of Peace" had been long shadowed forth, as in Melchizedek, "King of Salem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of Peace;" and again in Solomon, "the peaceful one;" and Isaiah himself had already prophesied the peacefulness of the Messiah's kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Compare the song of the angels at our Lord's birth (<a href="/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). If the peacefulness has not vet very clearly shown itself, the reason would seem to be that our Lord's kingdom has yet to come into the hearts of most men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">unto us</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
