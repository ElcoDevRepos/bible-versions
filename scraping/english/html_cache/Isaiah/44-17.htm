In the ancient Near Eastern context, idol-making was common, with craftsmen fashioning gods from wood, stone, or metal. The irony is that the same material used for mundane purposes is also used to create something deemed divine. This reflects the futility and deception of idol worship, as emphasized in <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, where idols are described as having mouths but cannot speak, eyes but cannot see. The act of creating a god from leftover material underscores the foolishness of attributing divine power to something man-made.<p><b>He bows down to it and worships;</b><br>Bowing down signifies submission and reverence, actions that should be reserved for the true God. In biblical times, bowing was a physical act of worship, indicating the worshiper's acknowledgment of the deity's authority. This phrase illustrates the misplaced devotion of idolaters, who offer the worship due to God alone to lifeless objects. The act of worshiping a graven image is a direct violation of the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), which prohibit the worship of other gods and the making of idols. This misplaced worship is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where prophets like Isaiah call the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>he prays to it and says, &#8220;Save me, for you are my god.&#8221;</b><br>Prayer is a form of communication with the divine, seeking intervention or assistance. The futility of praying to an idol is evident, as it lacks the power to save or respond. This reflects the spiritual blindness and desperation of idolaters, who turn to powerless objects for salvation. The plea for salvation is central to the biblical narrative, where true deliverance is found in God alone. In contrast, the New Testament reveals Jesus Christ as the Savior, fulfilling the prophecies of deliverance and offering salvation to all who believe in Him (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). The irony of seeking salvation from a graven image highlights the need for true faith in the living God, who alone can save.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

With the scrap that remains, he carves an object and promotes it to divine status. By doing so, he transfers value from the Creator to created matter, reversing the order set out in <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> and violating the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This scene echoes the satire in <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-20</a> and <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, where idols are described as powerless works of human hands. The phrase &#8220;graven image&#8221; also links to <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>, underscoring how seriously God forbids any physical representation meant to rival Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He bows down to it and worships</b><p>What began as leftover lumber becomes the focus of heartfelt devotion. The craftsman&#8217;s posture&#8212;bowing&#8212;signals surrender and allegiance (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>). Scripture consistently warns that the act of worship shapes the worshiper; those who fashion idols become &#8220;like them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/135-18.htm">Psalm 135:18</a>). Isaiah exposes the irrationality: the same man who earlier scattered wood shavings on the floor now kneels before those shavings reshaped. The irony is intended to jolt readers into realizing that idolatry is not merely incorrect but absurd (<a href="/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>). Genuine worship belongs solely to the living God, who alone is worthy (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He prays to it and says, &#8220;Save me, for you are my god.&#8221;</b><p>Here the tragedy deepens. The idol-maker seeks salvation&#8212;from hunger, danger, emptiness&#8212;from a block of wood. In doing so he redirects prayers that should rise to the Lord, &#8220;a very present help in trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>), toward a lifeless object that &#8220;cannot answer or save&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27-28</a>). Isaiah contrasts this futility with the Lord&#8217;s unique power: &#8220;Apart from Me there is no savior&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>). The plea &#8220;Save me&#8221; laid at the feet of an idol exposes the heart&#8217;s misplaced trust and magnifies the need for repentance and faith in the one true God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226;
