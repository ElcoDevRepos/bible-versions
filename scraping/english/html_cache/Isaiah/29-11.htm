In biblical times, scrolls were common for recording important documents, and a sealed scroll indicated that its contents were not accessible to everyone, often reserved for those with authority or understanding. This imagery highlights the people's inability to grasp God's message because of their disobedience and lack of faith. The sealed scroll also foreshadows the book of Revelation, where a sealed scroll is opened by the Lamb, symbolizing Christ's unique authority to reveal God's ultimate plan (<a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5:1-5</a>).<p><b>If it is handed to someone to read,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the act of attempting to understand or interpret the vision. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, literacy was not widespread, and reading was often a task for scribes or those educated in the Scriptures. The act of handing the scroll to someone signifies the desire for understanding and the seeking of wisdom, which is a recurring theme in the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-6</a>).<p><b>he will say, &#8220;I cannot, because it is sealed.&#8221;</b><br>The response of the person indicates the futility of trying to comprehend divine revelation without spiritual insight. The sealed nature of the scroll symbolizes the hiddenness of God's wisdom to those who are not spiritually attuned. This echoes the New Testament teaching that spiritual truths are discerned through the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). The inability to read the sealed scroll serves as a metaphor for the spiritual condition of the people, who are unable to perceive God's truth due to their rebellion and lack of repentance. This also points to the necessity of divine intervention for true understanding, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who opens the Scriptures to His followers (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Isaiah likens the prophetic message to that kind of document&#8212;present, complete, but inaccessible.<p>- Daniel heard a similar command: &#8220;seal the words until the time of the end&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4, 9</a>).<p>- <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1&#8211;2</a> echoes the image and points to Christ as the only One worthy to open the seals.<p>- For Judah, the seal lay not on the scroll but on their hearts (<a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If it is handed to someone to read</b><p>- Even the educated&#8212;priests, scribes, leaders&#8212;are offered the scroll. Jeremiah tried this with the nobles of Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/36-14.htm">Jeremiah 36:14&#8211;19</a>).<p>- Jesus later marvels that Nicodemus, &#8220;the teacher of Israel,&#8221; still did not understand heavenly things (<a href="/john/3-10.htm">John 3:10</a>).<p>- Intellectual ability is not the issue; spiritual receptivity is (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will say, &#8220;I cannot, because it is sealed.&#8221;</b><p>- The excuse sounds reasonable, yet it exposes a deeper problem: unwillingness. <a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11&#8211;12</a> describes hearts that &#8220;stopped their ears.&#8221;<p>- God responds by allowing the blindness they insist upon (<a href="/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>, quoting <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24&#8211;28</a> warns that persistent refusal eventually leads to a point where people &#8220;will call on Me, but I will not answer.&#8221;<p>- Still, grace remains available: Jesus invites Laodicea to buy &#8220;salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11</a> pictures God&#8217;s full, true revelation sitting right in front of His people, yet they treat it as a sealed scroll. The problem is not the clarity of God&#8217;s Word but the hardness of human hearts. When people resist, God allows a judicial blindness; when they humble themselves, He gladly opens the seals. Ultimately, the Lamb of God (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>) breaks every barrier, making the once&#8211;sealed message of judgment and hope plain to all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The vision of all . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the whole vision, i.e., </span>the entire substance of Isaiah's teaching. The words perhaps imply that this had been committed to writing, but that to the unbelievers they were as "the roll of a sealed book." The same imagery meets us in <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm" title="And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?">Revelation 5:2</a>. The wise of this world treated its dark sayings as seals, which forbade their making any attempt to study it.

Written documents were often sealed up to secure secrecy, the sealing being done in various ways.
