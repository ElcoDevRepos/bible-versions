The "he" likely refers to Jacob or Israel personified, seeing the fulfillment of God's promises through his descendants. This imagery of children surrounding a patriarch is reminiscent of the blessings promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where their descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). It signifies a time of peace and prosperity, contrasting with the earlier judgments pronounced in Isaiah.<p><b>the work of My hands</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and creative power. The children of Israel are not just biological descendants but are shaped and formed by God's divine intervention and purpose. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, where God is described as the potter and His people as the clay. It underscores the idea that Israel's restoration is not due to their merit but is a result of God's gracious work.<p><b>they will honor My name</b><br>Honoring God's name involves recognizing His holiness, authority, and character. In the biblical context, a name represents the essence of a person. This phrase indicates a return to true worship and reverence for God, fulfilling the commandment to not take the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). It reflects a transformation in the hearts of the people, aligning with the prophetic vision of a renewed covenant relationship.<p><b>they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob</b><br>Sanctifying the Holy One means setting God apart as holy and acknowledging His unique position as the God of Israel. The title "Holy One of Jacob" connects to the covenantal relationship established with the patriarchs. This sanctification is a response to God's redemptive acts and is a theme throughout Isaiah, where God's holiness is a central attribute (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p><b>and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel</b><br>Standing in awe implies a deep reverence and fear of the Lord, recognizing His majesty and power. This response is often seen in theophanies and divine encounters throughout Scripture, such as Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>). The phrase "God of Israel" reaffirms God's special relationship with His chosen people, highlighting His faithfulness to His promises despite their unfaithfulness. This awe is a result of witnessing God's mighty acts and serves as a call to worship and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry was primarily to the Kingdom of Judah.
