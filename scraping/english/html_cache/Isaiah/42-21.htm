In the context of Isaiah, it reflects God's sovereign will and purpose. The pleasure of the LORD is often associated with His plans and purposes being fulfilled (<a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>). It underscores the idea that God's actions are not arbitrary but are rooted in His divine pleasure and purpose.<p><b>for the sake of His righteousness</b><br>God's righteousness is a central theme throughout the Bible, representing His moral perfection and justice. In Isaiah, God's righteousness often involves His faithfulness to His covenant and His commitment to justice and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/46-13.htm">Isaiah 46:13</a>). This phrase suggests that God's actions are motivated by His inherent righteousness, ensuring that His law and purposes align with His holy nature.<p><b>to magnify His law</b><br>The law here refers to God's commandments and instructions given to His people. To "magnify" the law means to elevate its importance and make it more widely understood and respected. This can be seen in the context of the coming of Christ, who fulfilled the law and expanded its understanding (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The magnification of the law also points to the prophetic role of the Messiah, who would embody and teach God's perfect law.<p><b>and make it glorious</b><br>Making the law glorious implies revealing its true beauty and worth. In the biblical context, the law was not just a set of rules but a reflection of God's character and a guide for righteous living. The glory of the law is fully realized in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, who exemplifies and fulfills the law's intent (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-11</a>). This transformation from the written code to the living Word highlights the law's ultimate purpose in leading people to a deeper relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is righteous and just.
