The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's supreme command over the armies of heaven, highlighting His power and authority. The concept of a "remnant" is significant throughout Scripture, indicating God's preservation of a faithful group despite widespread judgment. This remnant theology is seen in other passages such as <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27-29</a>, where Paul references Isaiah to explain God's mercy in preserving a remnant of Israel. Historically, the survival of a remnant was crucial for the continuation of God's covenant promises, ultimately leading to the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>we would have become like Sodom</b><br>Sodom is a symbol of extreme wickedness and divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The comparison to Sodom underscores the severity of Judah's sin and the impending judgment they faced. This allusion serves as a warning, reminding the people of the total destruction that befell Sodom due to its unrepentant sinfulness. The mention of Sodom also foreshadows the New Testament warnings about judgment, such as in <a href="/luke/17-28.htm">Luke 17:28-30</a>, where Jesus compares the days of His return to the days of Sodom.<p><b>we would have resembled Gomorrah</b><br>Gomorrah, like Sodom, represents utter destruction due to sin. The parallelism in this phrase reinforces the gravity of Judah's situation and the mercy of God in sparing them from complete annihilation. The destruction of Gomorrah, alongside Sodom, serves as a historical and moral lesson throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>, which warns of the consequences of immorality and rebellion against God. The preservation of a remnant from becoming like Gomorrah highlights God's grace and the hope of redemption, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers salvation from judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly armies.

Though the nation had rebelled (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2&#8211;4</a>), God remained true to His promises to Abraham and David (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;a few survivors</b><p>- &#8220;A few&#8221; points to a remnant&#8212;small, but real.

Without that mercy, the nation would have been wiped out like Sodom and Gomorrah. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty, the reality of judgment, and the hope found in a preserved remnant&#8212;a timeless reminder that every believer and every nation lives by the Lord&#8217;s steadfast grace alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Except the Lord of hosts </span>. . .--This name also had been stamped on the prophet's mind at the time of his call (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The God of the hosts (or <span class= "ital">armies</span>) of heaven (sun, moon and stars, angels and archangels) and of earth had not been unmindful of the people. The idea of the "remnant" left when the rest of the people perished is closely connected with the leading thought of <a href="/context/isaiah/6-12.htm" title="And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the middle of the land.">Isaiah 6:12-13</a>. It had, perhaps, been impressed on the prophet's mind by the "remnant" of Israel that had escaped from Tiglath-pileser or Sargon (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-6.htm" title="So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.">2Chronicles 30:6</a>; comp. <a href="/micah/5-7.htm" title="And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the middle of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers on the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men.">Micah 5:7</a>).<p><span class= "bld">We should have been as Sodom </span>. . .--Here the prophet, continuing perhaps the thought of <a href="/isaiah/1-7.htm" title="Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.">Isaiah 1:7</a>, speaks of the destruction, in the next verse of the guilt, of the cities of the plain. Both had passed into a proverb. So Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/16-46.htm" title="And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.">Ezekiel 16:46-56</a>) works out the parallelism; so our Lord speaks of the guilt of Sodom as being lighter than that of Capernaum (<a href="/matthew/11-23.htm" title="And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.">Matthew 11:23</a>); so the tradition has condensed itself in the Arabic proverb, quoted by Cheyne, "More unjust than a <span class= "ital">kadi </span>of Sodom." (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm" title="The show of their countenance does witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe to their soul! for they have rewarded evil to themselves.">Isaiah 3:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm" title="For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom.</span> Lowth and Cheyne prefer to divide the two clauses differently, and to translate, "Except the Lord of hosts had left us a remnant, within a little we should have been like Sodom." The "remnant" is that of the few godly men who still inhabit Jerusalem. The comparison of Jerusalem with Sodom is made again in <a href="/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>, and is carried out at some length by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/16-44.htm">Ezekiel 16:44-57</a>).
