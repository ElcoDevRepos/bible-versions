The term "witness" suggests a role of testifying to God's truth and character. In the context of Isaiah, this can be seen as a reference to the coming Messiah, who would reveal God's will to all nations, not just Israel. The use of "nations" indicates a universal scope, aligning with the Abrahamic promise that through his seed all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). This anticipates the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, fulfilling the role of a witness to the world.<p><b>a leader and commander of the peoples</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to authority and governance. The terms "leader" and "commander" imply not only guidance but also the power to direct and govern. Historically, this reflects the Davidic covenant, where God promised David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" and is seen as the eternal King. The "peoples" suggests a broader audience beyond Israel, indicating the inclusion of Gentiles into God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>, where Paul speaks of the unity of Jews and Gentiles in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry was primarily to the Kingdom of Judah.

By ordinary rules of grammar, the pronoun "him" should refer to David; and so the passage is understood by Gesenius, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne. But, as Isaiah frequently sets aside ordinary grammatical rules, and as the position to the person here spoken of seems too high for the historical David, a large number of commentators, including Vitringa, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Dr. Kay, consider that the Messiah is intended. It is certainly difficult to see how the historical David could be, at this time and in the future, a "leader and commander to the peoples" who were about to flock into the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">witness... a leader and commander.</span> Christ was all these.

He "feeds and leads" his people (<a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>), and is the "Commander" under whose banner they serve (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>).
