Fasting, a practice meant for humility and seeking God, had become a source of conflict and division. In biblical context, fasting was often associated with repentance and seeking divine intervention (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>). However, the Israelites were using it as a means to assert superiority or to engage in disputes, contrary to the intended purpose. This reflects a broader theme in Scripture where God desires mercy and justice over ritualistic observance (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p><b>to strike viciously with your fist</b><br>The imagery of striking with a fist suggests aggression and violence, which is antithetical to the spirit of fasting. This behavior indicates a heart condition that is far from God&#8217;s desires. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, physical violence was a serious breach of the covenant community's ethics. The prophets often condemned such behavior as evidence of a society that had turned away from God (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). This phrase underscores the hypocrisy of engaging in religious practices while harboring malice and aggression.<p><b>You cannot fast as you do today</b><br>This statement serves as a rebuke and a call to self-examination. The Israelites' current manner of fasting was ineffective and unacceptable to God. It suggests that their religious practices were superficial and lacked genuine repentance or transformation. The historical context shows that during times of crisis, such as impending invasion or famine, fasting was a common response. However, without a change of heart, these actions were meaningless (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>).<p><b>and have your voice be heard on high</b><br>The phrase implies that God does not respond to insincere worship. The "voice" here represents prayers and petitions that accompany fasting. In biblical theology, God hears the cries of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>), but He is distant from those who practice iniquity (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). This serves as a reminder that God values the condition of the heart over external rituals. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>, emphasizes the importance of sincerity and humility in fasting, aligning with the teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Fasting had become a stage for arguments, not an act of humility (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links acceptable worship to a right heart: &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>); &#8220;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine fasting subdues self and seeks God&#8217;s face; a combative spirit exposes self-interest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To strike viciously with your fist</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to strike viciously with your fist.&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>)<p>&#8226; The verse pictures fasting that actually fuels violence&#8212;an irony Isaiah highlights. Religious exercise was supposed to restrain the flesh (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13&#8211;15</a>), yet it was empowering aggression.<p>&#8226; This echoes the oppression condemned in the surrounding verses: unjust labor (<a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>), yokes and chains (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>), pointing fingers (<a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm">Isaiah 58:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God measures devotion not by the rigor of a ritual but by the righteousness it produces (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You cannot fast as you do today</b><p>&#8220;You cannot fast as you do today&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>)<p>&#8226; The Lord flatly rejects the current pattern. Merely repeating religious motions does not obligate God to respond (<a href="/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God calls His people to repent of form without substance (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21&#8211;24</a>; <a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; A true fast aligns the heart with God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;loosing bonds, sharing bread, sheltering the poor (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And have your voice be heard on high</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and expect your voice to be heard on high.&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a>)<p>&#8226; Heaven is not indifferent, but it is holy.

He links reward to authenticity, not publicity or coercion.<p>&#8226; Therefore, unanswered prayer may expose a deeper issue: unresolved sin or broken relationships (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4</a> teaches that fasting detached from love, justice, and humility offends God rather than pleases Him.

Delitzsch explains, "When fasting, they are doubly irritable and ill tempered; and this leads to quarrelling and strife, even to striking with angry fists." This is quite a possible explanation. Or there may have been two parties, one for, the other against, fasting; and those who practised fasting may have done it, as some preached Christ, "of envy and strife" (<a href="/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>) - to provoke the opposite side. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "ye must not fast as ye do at present, if ye would have your voices heard in heaven."
