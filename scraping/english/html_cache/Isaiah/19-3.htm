Historically, Egypt was known for its strong national identity and pride, often seen in its monumental architecture and military prowess. The "spirit" here refers to the collective morale and cultural vitality. This emptying out can be seen as a divine judgment, similar to how God dealt with other nations in the Old Testament, such as Babylon and Assyria. Theologically, it reflects the idea that God can humble even the most powerful nations.<p><b>and I will frustrate their plans</b><br>This suggests divine intervention in the political and social strategies of Egypt. Throughout the Bible, God is depicted as sovereign over the affairs of nations, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, which states, "Many are the plans in a person&#8217;s heart, but it is the LORD&#8217;s purpose that prevails." Historically, Egypt was a center of wisdom and strategy, often relying on its advisors and magicians. The frustration of their plans indicates a direct challenge to their reliance on human wisdom over divine guidance.<p><b>so that they will resort to idols and spirits of the dead</b><br>This phrase highlights a return to idolatry and necromancy, practices that were common in ancient Egypt. The Egyptians worshiped a pantheon of gods and often sought guidance from the dead, as seen in their elaborate burial practices and the Book of the Dead. Biblically, this is a sign of spiritual decline, as turning to idols and the dead is condemned in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>. It underscores the futility of seeking help from sources other than God.<p><b>to mediums and spiritists</b><br>Mediums and spiritists were individuals who claimed to communicate with the spiritual realm, often for guidance or prophecy. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, such practices were intertwined with their religious beliefs. However, the Bible consistently warns against these practices, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a> and <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>, emphasizing reliance on God alone.
