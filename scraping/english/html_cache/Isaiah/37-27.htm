Historically, the Assyrian Empire was known for its military might and brutal conquests, leaving the inhabitants of defeated cities powerless. Theologically, this can be seen as a demonstration of God's sovereignty over nations, where human strength is insufficient without divine support. This aligns with the biblical theme that true power comes from God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>.<p><b>are dismayed and ashamed.</b><br>The emotional state of dismay and shame reflects the humiliation and fear experienced by those who have been defeated. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, defeat often brought disgrace not only to the people but also to their gods, as military victories were seen as a reflection of divine favor. This phrase underscores the futility of relying on human strength and the inevitable shame that follows when God is not acknowledged as the source of true power.<p><b>They are like plants in the field,</b><br>This simile draws on agricultural imagery common in the Bible, symbolizing vulnerability and transience. Plants in the field are subject to the elements and can be easily destroyed, much like the inhabitants who are defenseless against the Assyrian onslaught. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compare human life to grass that flourishes and then fades.<p><b>tender green shoots,</b><br>The mention of "tender green shoots" emphasizes the fragility and early stage of growth, suggesting that the inhabitants are not only vulnerable but also lacking in maturity and strength. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual immaturity or a lack of preparedness in the face of adversity. The Bible often uses agricultural metaphors to describe spiritual growth and maturity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/2-2.htm">1 Peter 2:2</a>.<p><b>grass on the rooftops,</b><br>Grass growing on rooftops is an image of futility and impermanence, as such grass lacks deep roots and is easily scorched by the sun. In the historical context, flat roofs in ancient Israel were often covered with a thin layer of soil where grass might sprout, but it would not last long. This imagery is used in <a href="/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a> to describe the fleeting success of the wicked, reinforcing the idea that without a strong foundation, prosperity is short-lived.<p><b>scorched before it is grown.</b><br>This final phrase highlights the inevitability of destruction before maturity is reached. It serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and self-reliance, as well as a reminder of the judgment that comes from God. The scorching heat can be seen as a metaphor for divine judgment, similar to the refining fire mentioned in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>. This imagery also points to the ultimate futility of human efforts apart from God's blessing and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
