In the context of Isaiah, it serves as a warning to the people of Judah who have strayed from God's commandments. The phrase "heroes in drinking wine" uses irony, as the term "heroes" typically denotes valor and strength, yet here it is applied to those who excel in indulgence and excess. This reflects a cultural context where social gatherings and feasting were common, but the excessive consumption of wine was seen as a moral failing. The Bible frequently warns against drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>), highlighting the loss of self-control and the potential for moral decay.<p><b>and champions in mixing strong drink</b><br>The word "champions" further emphasizes the irony, as it suggests mastery and skill, yet it is applied to those who take pride in their ability to mix and consume strong drink. This phrase indicates not just consumption but also the preparation and celebration of intoxicating beverages, which were prevalent in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The mixing of strong drink could refer to the practice of diluting wine with spices or other substances to enhance its potency. This behavior is condemned as it leads to moral and spiritual decline, distracting individuals from their responsibilities and relationship with God. The Bible consistently associates sobriety with wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, <a href="/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>), contrasting it with the folly of drunkenness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The verse exposes a tragic inversion: men hailed as &#8220;heroes&#8221; and &#8220;champions&#8221; are, in fact, enslaved weaklings. Their celebration of intoxication numbs conscience, distorts judgment, and helps unravel society. The Lord&#8217;s warning stands: revelry that ignores His holiness invites His judgment, while those who walk in sobriety and reverence find true honor and lasting joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Woe unto them that are mighty to drink. . . . strong drink.</span>--The words in part reproduce the "woe" of <a href="/context/isaiah/5-11.htm" title="Woe to them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>, but with the distinctive feature that there the revellers were simply of the careless self-indulgent type, while here they are identified with the unjust and corrupt rulers.

The sixth woe may be considered to be pronounced rather upon their corruption than upon their drinking, and so to be really quite distinct from the second (comp. <a href="/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4, 5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/5-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1429;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah!
