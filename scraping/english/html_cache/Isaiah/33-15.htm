In the biblical context, walking is often used metaphorically to describe one's conduct or way of life (e.g., <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). Righteousness in the Old Testament is closely tied to adherence to God's laws and commands. The righteous person is one who aligns their life with God's standards, reflecting His character. This is a call to live in a way that is pleasing to God, echoing the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and speaks with sincerity</b><br>Sincerity in speech is a hallmark of a person of integrity. The Bible frequently warns against deceitful speech (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>; <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-10</a>). In a historical context, truthful speech was vital for maintaining justice and community trust. This phrase underscores the importance of honesty and transparency, reflecting God's truthfulness. Jesus, who is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), exemplifies this sincerity.<p><b>who refuses gain from extortion</b><br>This phrase condemns the practice of gaining wealth through unjust means. Extortion, or the use of power to obtain money or goods unfairly, was a common issue in ancient societies, including Israel. The Law of Moses explicitly forbade such practices (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). This reflects God's concern for justice and fairness, and His desire for His people to act justly (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>whose hand never takes a bribe</b><br>Bribery undermines justice and is repeatedly condemned in Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). In ancient Israel, judges and leaders were expected to be impartial and fair, reflecting God's justice. This phrase highlights the importance of integrity in leadership and decision-making. It also points to the ultimate Judge, Jesus Christ, who judges with righteousness and fairness (<a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>).<p><b>who stops his ears against murderous plots</b><br>This phrase speaks to the rejection of violence and complicity in evil schemes. Murder and violence are condemned throughout the Bible (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>). In a cultural context, refusing to listen to such plots demonstrates a commitment to peace and the sanctity of life. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who calls His followers to be peacemakers (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>and shuts his eyes tightly against evil&#8212;</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the active rejection of evil in all its forms. The imagery of shutting one's eyes suggests a deliberate choice to avoid sin and temptation. In biblical teaching, believers are called to be holy and separate from sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). This reflects the call to live a life that is set apart for God, resisting the influence of a fallen world. Jesus, who was without sin, serves as the ultimate example of living a life free from evil (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry was primarily to the Kingdom of Judah.
