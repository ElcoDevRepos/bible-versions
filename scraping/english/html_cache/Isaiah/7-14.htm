In the context of <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, King Ahaz of Judah is facing the threat of invasion from Israel and Syria. Despite Ahaz's reluctance to ask for a sign, God offers one to demonstrate His sovereignty and faithfulness. This sign is not just for Ahaz but for the house of David, emphasizing God's commitment to His covenant with David's lineage.<p><b>Behold, the virgin will be with child:</b><br>The term "virgin" is significant, traditionally understood as a young woman of marriageable age. In the New Testament, <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a> cites this prophecy, applying it to the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, highlighting the miraculous nature of His conception. This aligns with the Christian belief in the incarnation, where Jesus is both fully God and fully man. The Hebrew word "almah" can mean young woman, but the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, uses "parthenos," meaning virgin, reinforcing the miraculous aspect.<p><b>and give birth to a son:</b><br>The birth of a son signifies the continuation of a lineage and the fulfillment of God's promises. In the immediate context, this could refer to a child born during Isaiah's time, symbolizing hope and God's presence with His people. In the broader biblical narrative, it points to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whose birth is central to the Christian faith.<p><b>and will call Him Immanuel:</b><br>"Immanuel" means "God with us," encapsulating the essence of the prophecy. In the historical context, it reassures the people of Judah of God's presence amidst their political turmoil. In the New Testament, this name is directly associated with Jesus, affirming His divine nature and His role as God dwelling among humanity. This concept is foundational to Christian theology, emphasizing God's intimate involvement in human history and His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
