In biblical context, the heart is often seen as the center of thought and emotion. This introspection suggests a moment of revelation or understanding, possibly inspired by divine intervention. It reflects a personal and profound moment of realization, often seen in prophetic literature where God reveals His plans to His people.<p><b>&#8216;Who has begotten these for me?</b><br>The question implies surprise and wonder at unexpected blessings. In the historical context of Israel, this could refer to the return of the exiles or the growth of the nation despite previous desolation. The imagery of childbirth is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing new beginnings or the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in the stories of Sarah and Hannah.<p><b>I was bereaved and barren;</b><br>This phrase highlights a state of loss and hopelessness. Bereavement and barrenness were particularly devastating in ancient cultures, where lineage and inheritance were crucial. This reflects Israel's condition during the Babylonian exile, feeling abandoned and without future. Theologically, it underscores human helplessness without divine intervention.<p><b>I was exiled and rejected.</b><br>Exile and rejection describe Israel's historical experience during the Babylonian captivity. This period was marked by a sense of abandonment by God and loss of identity. Theologically, it represents the consequences of sin and disobedience, yet also sets the stage for redemption and restoration, as God promises to bring His people back.<p><b>So who has reared them?</b><br>This question emphasizes the unexpected nature of the restoration. It suggests that the growth and return of the people are not by human effort but by divine action. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as the ultimate provider and sustainer, as seen in the miraculous provision for Israel throughout their history.<p><b>Look, I was left all alone,</b><br>The feeling of being alone underscores the depth of despair experienced by Israel. This isolation is both physical and spiritual, reflecting the nation's separation from God and their land. Yet, it also sets the stage for God's intervention, as He promises to never leave nor forsake His people, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>so where did they come from?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The astonishment at the sudden appearance of children symbolizes the miraculous nature of God's restoration. It points to the fulfillment of God's promises to restore and multiply His people. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings spiritual rebirth and restoration to humanity, fulfilling God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>Often personified as a woman in the book of Isaiah, representing the people of Israel and their spiritual state.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>Refers to the Babylonian captivity, a period when the Israelites were taken from their homeland and lived in Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The prophesied return of the Israelites to their homeland, symbolizing restoration and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_children.htm">The Children</a></b><br>Symbolic of the future generations and the growth of the nation of Israel, despite previous desolation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_question.htm">The Heart's Question</a></b><br>Represents the astonishment and disbelief of Zion at the unexpected blessing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_to_restore.htm">God's Power to Restore</a></b><br>Despite feelings of abandonment and desolation, God has the power to restore and bring forth new life and blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unexpected_blessings.htm">Unexpected Blessings</a></b><br>God's plans often exceed our expectations, and He can bring about growth and prosperity from situations that seem hopeless.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seem contrary.

That they are not her natural children she is sure, since she knows that she has been for a long time "bereaved and unfruitful" (Cheyne) - a captive, and a "wanderer" (Kay).
