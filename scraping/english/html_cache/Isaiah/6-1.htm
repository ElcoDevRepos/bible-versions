King Uzziah reigned over Judah for approximately 52 years, a period marked by prosperity and military success. His death around 740 BC marked the end of an era and a time of uncertainty for the nation. Uzziah's reign is detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>, where his initial faithfulness and subsequent pride are highlighted. His death symbolizes a transition and a reminder of human mortality and the need for divine leadership.<p><b>I saw the Lord</b><br>Isaiah's vision of the Lord is a theophany, a visible manifestation of God. This encounter emphasizes God's sovereignty and holiness. The term "Lord" here is significant, often associated with God's covenant name, Yahweh, indicating a personal and relational aspect of God. This vision underscores the prophetic calling of Isaiah, aligning with other biblical figures who encountered God, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a> and Ezekiel in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>.<p><b>Seated on a throne</b><br>The imagery of God seated on a throne conveys His authority and kingship over all creation. Thrones are symbols of power and judgment, and this vision reassures Isaiah of God's control amidst political instability. This throne room scene parallels other biblical visions, such as those in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> and <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a>, where God's sovereignty is a central theme.<p><b>High and exalted</b><br>This description emphasizes God's transcendence and majesty. The terms "high" and "exalted" reflect God's supreme position above all earthly rulers and powers. This language is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a>, which declares God's exaltation above all gods. It serves as a reminder of God's unparalleled greatness and the reverence due to Him.<p><b>And the train of His robe filled the temple</b><br>The train of the robe symbolizes majesty and splendor. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the length of a king's robe was a measure of his status and glory. The fact that it "filled the temple" signifies God's overwhelming presence and glory, leaving no space for anything else. This imagery connects to the temple as the dwelling place of God, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>, where the glory of the Lord filled Solomon's temple. It foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

Had it been after it, the first year of king Jotham would have been the more natural formula. The chapter gives us the narrative of the solemn call of Isaiah to the office of a prophet. It does not follow that it was written at that time, and we may even believe that, if the prophet were the editor of his own discourses, he may have designedly placed the narrative in this position that men might see what he himself saw, that all that was found in the preceding chapters was but the development of what he had then heard, and yet, at the same time, a representation of the evils which made the judgments he was commissioned to declare necessary. On the relation of the call to the prophet's previous life, see <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p>The date is obviously given as important, and we are led to connect it with the crisis in the prophet's life of which it tells. He had lived through the last twenty years or so of Uzziah's reign. There was the show of outward material prosperity. There was the reality of much inward corruption. The king who had profaned the holiness of the Temple had either just died or was dragging out the dregs of his leprous life in seclusion (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm" title="And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelled in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.">2Chronicles 26:21</a>). The question, What was to be the future of his people? must have been much in the prophet's thoughts. The earthquake that had terrified Jerusalem had left on his mind a vague sense of impending judgment. It is significant that Isaiah's first work as a writer was to write the history of Uzziah's reign (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-22.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.">2Chronicles 26:22</a>). (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne.</span>--Isaiah had found himself in 'the court of the Temple, probably in that of the priests. He had seen the incense-clouds rising from the censer of the priest, and had heard the hymns and hallelujahs of the Levites. Suddenly he passes, as St. Paul afterwards passed, under the influence of like surroundings (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>), into a state of ecstatic trance, and as though the veil of the Temple was withdrawn, he saw the vision of the glory of the Lord, as Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>) and Micaiah of old had seen it (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19</a>), as in more recent times it had appeared to Amos (9:1). The King of kings was seated on His throne, and on the right hand and on the left were the angel-armies of the host of heaven, chanting their hymns of praise. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - THE VISION OF GOD SEEN BY ISAIAH. It is thought by some that this vision, and its sequel, constitute the original call of Isaiah to the prophetical office, and in order of time precede all the other contents of the book. But the position of the "vision" in the book is strongly against this view. Prophets who relate their original call naturally place it in the forefront of their narrative (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). It is quite possible, as Bishop Lowth says, that this was "a <span class="accented">new</span> designation, to introduce more solemnly a general declaration of the whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people, and the fates of the nations." The vision itself may profitably be compared with Ezekiel's first vision, which it much resembles (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Uzziah died.</span> The year <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, probably. We cannot determine from the phrase used whether the vision was seen before or after Uzziah's death. <span class="cmt_word">I saw also</span>; rather, <span class="accented">then it was that I saw</span> (comp. <a href="/exodus/16-6.htm">Exodus 16:6</a>). The Lord. Not "Jehovah," as in vers. 3 and 5, but "Adonay," for greater reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</span> The imagery is, of course, taken from the practice of earthly kings. Elaborate thrones were affected by the great monarchs of Egypt and Assyria (Lepsius, 'Deutmaler,' pt. 3. pls. 2, 76, 100, 121; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 150). Solomon's throne was perhaps even grander than any of these (see <a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>). It was placed at the summit of "<span class="accented">six</span> steps," so that its occupant was "<span class="accented">high</span> and lifted up" above all his courtiers. <span class="cmt_word">His train.</span> Not his train of attendants, but "the skirts of his robe." Flowing robes were commonly worn by great monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Filled the temple</span>; or, <span class="accented">the palace</span>. The same word is used in Hebrew for both. Dr. Kay supposes the prophet to be "in vision gazing on the actual temple - to see its veils drawn aside, and instead of the Shechinah enthroned on the cherubim, to behold the King of glory, enthroned on high, the fringes of his royal robe filling the temple, so that no human priest could minister there." But, as Mr. Cheyne observes, "palace is more in harmony with the picture than temple." It is the heavenly palace of the King of kings into which the prophet's gaze is allowed to penetrate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
