It suggests that the information being presented is not new but has been revealed before, possibly through the prophets or the Law. This echoes the call to remember God's past deeds, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3-4</a>, where the importance of recalling God's works is stressed.<p><b>Long ago I ordained it;</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal plan and foreknowledge. It underscores the belief that God is not reacting to events but has a predetermined plan. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and predestination, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where God&#8217;s plans are established before the foundation of the world.<p><b>in days of old I planned it.</b><br>This reinforces the idea of God's timeless nature and His control over history. It suggests that the events unfolding are part of a divine strategy established long ago. This can be connected to the prophetic nature of Scripture, where God reveals His plans through prophets, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>Now I have brought it to pass,</b><br>This indicates the fulfillment of God's plans in the present time. It reflects the biblical theme of prophecy and fulfillment, where God&#8217;s spoken word through the prophets comes to fruition. This is seen in the fulfillment of prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.</b><br>This phrase speaks to the specific judgment and destruction ordained by God, often as a consequence of sin or rebellion. It reflects the historical context of Assyrian conquests, where fortified cities were indeed reduced to ruins. This can be seen as a type of divine judgment, similar to the destruction of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, where God&#8217;s power is demonstrated through the fall of seemingly impregnable cities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

The adverb "long ago" should be connected with the words that follow. The events of history had all been foreseen and ordered, as in the remote past, by the counsels of Jehovah. Kings and armies were but as His puppets in the drama of the world's history. The words "hast thou not heard" suggest the thought that Isaiah assumes that Sennacherib had heard of his prophecies, or those of his fore-runners, as to the purposes of Jehovah--an assumption which, looking to the fact that he had ministers who were well acquainted with Hebrew (<a href="/isaiah/36-12.htm" title="But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?">Isaiah 36:12</a>), was in itself probable enough.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou not heard, etc.?</span> An abrupt transition, such as is common in Isaiah.

Art thou so ignorant, so devoid of that light of nature, which should "lighten every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), as not to know God's method of governing the world? How that "from long ago," in his eternal counsels, he designs the rise and fall of nations, and the mode in which their destruction is to be brought about? Art thou not aware that conquerors are mere instruments in God's hands - "the rods of his anger" (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>) - to work his will, and then to have his will worked upon them in turn (see <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6-19</a>)?
