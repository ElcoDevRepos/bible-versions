In ancient times, keys were large and carried on the shoulder, symbolizing the weight of responsibility. The "house of David" refers to the royal lineage and authority of the Davidic kingdom. This imagery is connected to the role of Eliakim, who was appointed as a steward over the royal household, replacing Shebna. The key symbolizes access and control over the kingdom's resources and decisions. This passage is often seen as a type of Christ, who holds the ultimate authority over the kingdom of God, as referenced in <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>, where Jesus is described as having the key of David.<p><b>What he opens no one can shut,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the absolute authority and sovereignty of the one who holds the key. In the context of Eliakim, it indicates his decisive power in the administration of the kingdom. Spiritually, this is seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's authority, where His decisions and actions are final and unchallengeable. The imagery of opening and shutting is also reminiscent of the authority given to Peter in <a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>, where the keys of the kingdom of heaven are mentioned, signifying binding and loosing.<p><b>and what he shuts no one can open.</b><br>This phrase reinforces the irrevocable nature of the authority granted. In the historical context, it underscores the trust and confidence placed in Eliakim's leadership. Prophetically, it points to the messianic authority of Jesus, who has the power to grant or deny access to the kingdom of God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7-8</a>, where Christ's authority to open and shut doors is highlighted, symbolizing His control over salvation and judgment. The imagery serves as a reminder of the ultimate power and sovereignty of God in the affairs of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

A key would seem to have been the special badge of the prefect's office, which included the control of the stores (ver. 15), and the general management of the household. It was, perhaps, a part of the form of investiture, that the key should be first laid on the prefect's shoulder and then delivered into his hand. Among the Greeks the priests of Ceres are said to have borne a key on their shoulder, permanently, as a badge of office (Callimach., 'Hymn. ad Cererem,' 1. 45). The reference to this passage in <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a> is sufficient to show that Eliakim, the "servant of Jehovah" (ver. 20), is, to a certain extent, a type of Christ; perhaps also of his faithful ministers (<a href="/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>;
