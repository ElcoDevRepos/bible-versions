The rhetorical question implies that no one has the authority or capability to guide or instruct the Spirit of the LORD. In the biblical context, the "Spirit of the LORD" refers to God's active presence and power in the world. This aligns with the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God is described as hovering over the waters, indicating divine involvement in creation. The phrase underscores the idea that God's wisdom and plans are beyond human comprehension, resonating with <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>, where God questions Job about the creation of the earth, highlighting human limitations.<p><b>or informed Him as His counselor?</b><br>This part of the verse further stresses the incomparability of God's wisdom. The rhetorical question suggests that God requires no advice or counsel from any being, as His understanding is perfect and complete. This is consistent with passages like <a href="/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>, which echoes the sentiment that no one can fathom the mind of the Lord or serve as His advisor. Historically, kings and rulers often had counselors to guide them, but this verse asserts that God, the ultimate King, needs no such guidance. Theologically, this points to the self-sufficiency and omnipotence of God, reinforcing the belief that His plans and purposes are executed with perfect wisdom and knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.

From the first page of Scripture, the Spirit of God is active and sovereign (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Spirit is never &#8220;steered&#8221; by created minds. Job learned this when God asked, &#8220;Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse sits in a chapter that magnifies God&#8217;s transcendence: He measures the waters in His hand (<a href="/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>) and calls the stars by name (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>). Directing such a Spirit is beyond us.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a> echoes the same line to underscore God&#8217;s unsearchable judgments. Paul&#8217;s point matches Isaiah&#8217;s: divine plans originate within God alone.<p>Takeaway: Because the Spirit acts of His own perfect wisdom and power, we can rest in His guidance without trying to manipulate or second-guess Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or informed Him as His counselor?</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or informed Him as His counselor?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a>)<p>&#8226; Counsel presumes deficiency&#8212;someone lacks insight and needs advice. God never occupies that position. &#8220;Who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct Him?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the wisest among humans&#8212;Solomon, Daniel, Paul&#8212;received wisdom; they never supplied it to God (<a href="/daniel/2-20.htm">Daniel 2:20-23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Job confessed, &#8220;Surely I spoke of things I did not understand&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>). When confronted with God&#8217;s grandeur, the only fitting response is humble silence and worship.<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s audience, surrounded by pagan nations who consulted idols and court advisors, hears a clarion reminder: the LORD&#8217;s counsel is self-contained. &#8220;The counsel of the LORD stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p>Implication: If God needs no counselor, His Word stands as the final authority.

Eastern cosmogonies might represent Bel or Ormuzd, as calling inferior deities into counsel (Cheyne). The prophet finds no other counsellor than One who is essentially one with the Eternal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?</span> Mr. Cheyne remarks, that "in Isaiah there is a marked tendency to hypostatize the Spirit;" and the remark is undoubtedly a just one (see <a href="/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, etc.). In the present place, perhaps, the introduction of "the Spirit of the Lord" arises out of the remembrance of the part in creation which is assigned to the Spirit in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. He "moved," or "brooded," upon the face of the waters, and thence began the change, or series of changes, by which order was produced out of confusion. The Spirit of the Lord "directed," or regulated, these changes; but who, Isaiah asks, "directed," or regulated, the Spirit itself? Can it be supposed that he too had a director over him? Isaiah does not seriously doubt on this point, or "leave it an open question." He makes his inquiry by way of a <span class="accented">reductio ad absurdum.</span> Is it not absurd to suppose that he had a director or a counsellor? He does not - here, at any rate - so far "hypostatize the Spirit" as to view him as a Person distinct from the Person of God the Father, working under him, and carrying out his will. <span class="cmt_word">Or being his counsellor hath taught him?</span> "The Lord <span class="accented">by wisdom</span> founded the earth" (<a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>); but he was his own counsellor. He had no adviser external to himself. The wisdom which wrought with him was his own wisdom, an essential part of the Divine essence. The evangelical prophet approaches those mysteries of God's nature which the gospel brought to light, but cannot penetrate them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/40-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has directed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;ik&#183;k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8505.htm">Strong's 8505: </a> </span><span class="str2">To balance, measure out, arrange, equalize, levelling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or who has given Him</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;&#8216;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">counsel?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1510;&#1464;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6098.htm">Strong's 6098: </a> </span><span class="str2">Advice, plan, prudence</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/isaiah/40-13.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 40:13 Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh (Isa Isi Is)</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/isaiah/40-12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 40:12"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 40:12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/isaiah/40-14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 40:14"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 40:14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
