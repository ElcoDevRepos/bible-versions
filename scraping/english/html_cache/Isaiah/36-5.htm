The Assyrians were known for their military prowess and had already conquered many nations, including the northern kingdom of Israel. The Rabshakeh's words challenge Judah's confidence in their military plans and capabilities. Historically, Judah was a smaller kingdom with limited military resources compared to the vast Assyrian empire. This phrase highlights the futility of relying solely on human strategies and strength without divine support, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>but these are empty words</b><br>The Rabshakeh dismisses Judah's confidence as baseless, suggesting that their plans and declarations of strength are mere rhetoric without substance. This reflects a common biblical theme where human boasting and self-reliance are contrasted with the need for dependence on God. In the broader biblical narrative, true strength and victory come from God, not from human might or wisdom. This is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which emphasizes trust in the name of the Lord over chariots and horses.<p><b>In whom are you now trusting</b><br>This question challenges the foundation of Judah's faith and trust. Historically, Judah had been tempted to form alliances with other nations, such as Egypt, to secure military support against Assyria. The Rabshakeh's question is designed to undermine any confidence Judah might have in such alliances or in their own strength. Biblically, trust in God is a central theme, and the prophets often rebuked Israel and Judah for placing their trust in foreign powers instead of in God. This question invites reflection on where true security and trust should be placed.<p><b>that you have rebelled against me?</b><br>The Rabshakeh frames Judah's resistance as rebellion against Assyria, which was the dominant power of the time. Historically, vassal states like Judah were expected to pay tribute and submit to the authority of their overlords. By resisting, Judah was defying the political and military expectations of the era. This phrase also highlights the tension between earthly authority and divine command. In the biblical context, Hezekiah's rebellion can be seen as an act of faithfulness to God, who had called His people to trust in Him alone. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where God's people are often called to stand against worldly powers in obedience to divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian invasion.
