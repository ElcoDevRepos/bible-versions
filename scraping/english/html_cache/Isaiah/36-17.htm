It reflects the Assyrian practice of deporting conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. Historically, the Assyrians were known for relocating populations to integrate them into the empire, which often led to the loss of cultural identity. This tactic was used to maintain control over vast territories.<p><b>to a land like your own</b><br>The promise of a land similar to their own is a psychological tactic aimed at reducing resistance by offering a semblance of normalcy and continuity. The Assyrians were attempting to persuade the Israelites that their lives would not be drastically altered, which was a common strategy to encourage surrender without a fight. This reflects the broader theme of exile found throughout the Bible, where God's people are often displaced due to disobedience, yet with a promise of eventual restoration.<p><b>a land of grain and new wine</b><br>Grain and new wine symbolize prosperity and abundance, common motifs in biblical literature representing God's blessing and provision. The Assyrian commander is attempting to entice the Israelites with promises of material wealth and sustenance. This echoes the descriptions of the Promised Land in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, where the land is described as flowing with milk and honey, indicating fertility and divine favor.<p><b>a land of bread and vineyards</b><br>Bread and vineyards further emphasize the idea of sustenance and prosperity. Vineyards, in particular, are often associated with joy and celebration in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>. The mention of bread and vineyards is intended to reassure the Israelites of a stable and prosperous life under Assyrian rule. This promise, however, is deceptive, as it contrasts with the biblical understanding that true peace and prosperity come from obedience to God and His covenant, not from foreign powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Every phrase targets Judah&#8217;s fears and desires, yet each also echoes blessings God alone can legitimately provide. The verse therefore contrasts two masters&#8212;an arrogant empire promising plenty and the LORD who truly owns the land and its abundance. By preserving this speech, Scripture warns believers to reject alluring shortcuts, stand firm in faith, and rely on the LORD&#8217;s unfailing covenant care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until I come and take you away</span>. It was so much thee usual policy of Assyria to remove to a new locality a conquered people, which had given them trouble, that Rabshakeh felt safe in assuming that the fate in store for the Jews, if they submitted themselves, was a transplantation. Sargon had transported the Israelites to Gozan and Media (<a href="/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>), the Tibarcni to Assyria, the Commageni to Susiana ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 423). Sennacherib himself had transported into Assyria more than two hundred thousand Aramaeans (ibid., p. 430). It might be confidently predicted that, if he conquered them, he would transplant the Jews. Rabshakeh tries to soften down the hardship of the lot before them by promises of a removal to a land equal in all respects to Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">To a land like your own land</span>. This was certainly not a general principle of Assyrian administration. Nations were removed from the far north to the extreme south, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, from arid to marshy tracts, from fertile regions to comparative deserts. The security of the empire, not the gratification of the transported slaves, was the ruling and guiding principle of all such changes. A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. The writer of Kings adds, "a land of oil olive and of honey."
