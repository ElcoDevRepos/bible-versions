Historically, the Northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC, and the Southern Kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The rhetorical question emphasizes that these events were not merely political or military failures but were divinely orchestrated as a consequence of Israel's disobedience. The use of "Jacob" and "Israel" highlights the entire nation, both the northern and southern kingdoms, as recipients of this judgment.<p><b>Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned?</b><br>This phrase identifies the LORD as the one who allowed these calamities due to the people's sin. The covenant relationship between God and Israel, established at Sinai, included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The people's idolatry and failure to uphold the covenant led to divine judgment. This reflects the consistent biblical theme that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><b>They were unwilling to walk in His ways,</b><br>This phrase highlights the people's stubbornness and rebellion. "Walking in His ways" refers to living according to God's commandments and statutes. The Israelites' unwillingness to follow God's path is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the cycles of sin and repentance in the Book of Judges and the prophetic calls to return to God. This disobedience is not just a failure to follow rules but a rejection of a relationship with God.<p><b>and they would not obey His law.</b><br>The law, or Torah, was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God. Disobedience to the law was tantamount to rejecting God's authority and wisdom. The prophets frequently called the people back to the law, emphasizing its role in maintaining the covenant relationship. This disobedience foreshadows the need for a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the law and offers grace for those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob/israel.htm">Jacob/Israel</a></b><br>Represents the people of God, the descendants of Jacob, who are often referred to as Israel.

Assyria&#8217;s raids and Babylon&#8217;s exile felt like the work of cruel empires, yet Isaiah points behind human armies to the ultimate Hand. Scripture consistently teaches that foreign domination over Israel was never random.<p>&#8226; Moses had warned that covenant unfaithfulness would end in &#8220;defeat before your enemies&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 49</a>-52).<p>&#8226; Judges describes the same pattern: &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anger burned&#8230; so He sold them into the hands of raiders&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, God again declares, &#8220;I will send for Nebuchadnezzar&#8230; and devote them to destruction&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).<p>These echoes remind us that God governs history, even the grim chapters. For the faithful, that certainty brings both sobriety and comfort: nothing slips past His sovereign oversight (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was it not the LORD</b><p>Isaiah answers his own question: yes, it was the LORD. He is never a spectator; He is the righteous Judge who disciplines His people for their good (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;If calamity occurs in a city, has not the LORD done it?&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Lamentations looks at Jerusalem&#8217;s smoking ruins and confesses, &#8220;The Lord has done what He purposed&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>).<p>Here, sovereignty is not abstract theology; it is the explanation for Israel&#8217;s real-life losses. God&#8217;s discipline vindicates His holiness and aims to restore wandering hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against whom we have sinned?</b><p>The verse shifts from God&#8217;s action to Israel&#8217;s culpability. Their primary offense was vertical&#8212;&#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). National tragedies, then, are linked to moral rebellion.<p>&#8226; The historian sums up the northern kingdom&#8217;s fall: &#8220;All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel echoes the confession from exile: &#8220;We have sinned and done wrong&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>).<p>Personal and collective sin grieves God, ruptures fellowship, and invites discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were unwilling to walk in His ways</b><p>Unwillingness reveals a heart problem deeper than isolated missteps. God&#8217;s ways were clearly laid out&#8212;&#8220;This is the way; walk in it&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>)&#8212;yet the people chose alternative paths.<p>&#8226; Early in the book Isaiah laments, &#8220;Children&#8230; have rebelled against Me&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah records God&#8217;s plea, &#8220;Walk in all the way I command you&#8230; but they did not listen&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23-24</a>).<p>The issue is stubborn resistance, not ignorance. God had spoken; they refused to heed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they would not obey His law</b><p>Their unwillingness took concrete form: they rejected the very covenant they had once affirmed (&#8220;We will do everything the LORD has said,&#8221; <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua warned, &#8220;If you forsake the LORD, He will turn and bring disaster&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Later generations repeated the cycle, &#8220;They would not listen but were stiff-necked&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>).<p>Obedience is the covenant&#8217;s hinge. Blessing or discipline flows from whether the people take God at His word (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/42-24.htm">Isaiah 42:24</a> answers its own question: the LORD Himself delivered His people to plunder because they persistently sinned, refused His paths, and rejected His law. Far from impugning God&#8217;s goodness, the verse showcases His faithfulness to His own covenant promises&#8212;promises that include both blessing for obedience and discipline for rebellion. His sovereign hand, righteous judgment, and loving purpose stand side by side, urging every reader to trust, obey, and walk in His ways today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/42.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Who gave Jacob for a spoil . . .?</span>--The sufferers, whether in the nearer or more distant exile, are reminded that they have brought their sufferings upon themselves, and that it is Jehovah who sends them in the wrath which, as aiming at their restoration, is but another aspect of His love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob...
