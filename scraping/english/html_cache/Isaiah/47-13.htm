In the context of ancient Babylon, the city was known for its wise men and counselors who were often consulted for guidance. This mirrors the broader biblical theme found in passages like <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which contrasts the counsel of the wicked with the law of the Lord. The weariness suggests a fruitless pursuit, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>, where all human endeavors apart from God are described as "vanity."<p><b>let them come forward now and save you&#8212;</b><br>This is a challenge to the supposed power of Babylon's counselors and diviners. It underscores the biblical principle that salvation and deliverance come only from God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>, where God declares, "I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior." The rhetorical nature of this challenge highlights the impotence of human efforts in the face of divine judgment.<p><b>your astrologers who observe the stars,</b><br>Astrology was a significant part of Babylonian culture, with astrologers playing a key role in advising the king and interpreting omens. This practice is condemned in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, where divination and astrology are listed among the abominations to the Lord. The reliance on astrology reflects a misplaced trust in creation rather than the Creator, contrasting with the biblical view that God alone controls the heavens (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-19</a>).<p><b>who monthly predict your fate.</b><br>The reference to monthly predictions indicates the regular and systematic nature of Babylonian astrology. This practice is contrasted with the biblical understanding of prophecy, which is not based on celestial patterns but on the revelation of God's will through His prophets. The futility of these predictions is highlighted in <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>, where God frustrates the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners.

Instead of turning to the Lord, they multiplied voices&#8212;yet all those voices only exhausted them. Isaiah pictures a nation worn out by conflicting strategies that lead nowhere (<a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>). The counsel of the Lord alone stands forever (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>), but Babylon preferred human schemes, so their strength was sapped.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let them come forward now and save you&#8212;</b><p>God throws down a challenge: &#8220;If these counselors are so powerful, let them step up.&#8221; It echoes earlier courtroom scenes where the Lord invites false gods to prove themselves (<a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a>; 44:7). Judgment is imminent, and the moment of truth has arrived. Babylon&#8217;s trusted experts must either deliver or be exposed&#8212;there will be no middle ground (<a href="/jeremiah/50-31.htm">Jeremiah 50:31-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your astrologers</b><p>Astrologers&#8212;literally &#8220;dividers of the heavens&#8221;&#8212;served at the king&#8217;s side (<a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>), claiming to decode destiny from celestial movements. Scripture consistently condemns such occult arts as detestable (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Their presence in Babylon shows how far the empire relied on darkness rather than the light of God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who observe the stars</b><p>These star-gazers tracked constellations, eclipses, and planetary alignments, believing the heavens controlled earthly affairs. Yet the same stars they worshiped were created and named by the Lord, who calls them out &#8220;one by one&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>; <a href="/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31-33</a>).

But the God of Israel declared such practices empty (<a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2-3</a>). While astrologers read calendars and charts, God alone sets times and seasons (<a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and in Christ the shadows of lunar observances find fulfillment (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>). Babylon&#8217;s monthly horoscopes would prove powerless when judgment fell.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a> exposes the folly of leaning on occult counsel instead of the Lord. Babylon&#8217;s endless advisers, astrologers, and star-readers could not rescue the empire from God&#8217;s righteous judgment. The verse reminds us that only the sovereign Creator directs history; all human or demonic substitutes leave us weary, deceived, and defenseless when God calls the world to account.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Let now the astrologers . . .</span>--The three words describe two aspects of the same art--(1) the <span class= "ital">dividers of the heavens, </span>assigning stellar influences to the signs of the Zodiac; (2) the "star-gazers," further defined as <span class= "ital">those who make known things to come at the new moon. </span>The Assyrian and Chaldaean observers compiled an almanack, in which the days of the month were noted as severally lucky or unlucky for the incidents of war or of home-life, as the case might be.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels.</span> Mr. Cheyne's rendering is more intelligible, "Thou hast wearied thyself with the multitude of thy consultations." Those at the head of affairs had consulted the diviners of all classes, till they were utterly weary of so doing (compare the "<span class="accented">consultations"</span> of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar with such persons, <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2-11</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 8</a>). Yet let one further effort be made. <span class="cmt_word">Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up</span>. These are scarcely three classes of persons, but rather the same class under three designations: "astrologers" (literally, "dividers of the heavens"); "star-gazers," or observers of the <span class="accented">stars</span>; and "monthly <span class="accented">prognosticators</span>," or almanack-makers. The astronomy of the Babylonians consisted primarily in "dividing the heavens" into "houses," or constellations, and thus mapping them out in such a way that the infinite multiplicity, which at first baffles the beholder, might be grasped, reduced to order, and brought within the sphere of distinct cognizance. This work was an eminently useful one, and maintains its place in astronomy to the present day ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 573). After the heavens were mapped out, and the courses of the sun and moon through the "houses" laid down, "<span class="accented">star-gazers"</span> directed their attention mainly to sun, moon, and planets, noting eclipses, occultations, conjunctions, and the like. All this was legitimate science; but, finally, the greater part of the astronomers launched into astrology, and undertook to prognosticate events from the changing phenomena of the heavens. Almanacks were put forth, in which predictions were made, either specially for a particular year, or generally for all time, based upon astronomical considerations; and on these great dependence was placed. (For a specimen of such an almanack, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 158-161.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/47-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are wearied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(nil&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3811.htm">Strong's 3811: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tire, to be, disgusted</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from your many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
