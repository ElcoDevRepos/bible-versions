The rebellion refers to their repeated turning away from God's commandments, as seen throughout their history, particularly during the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>). Grieving the Holy Spirit indicates a deep sorrow caused by their actions, suggesting a personal relationship between God and His people. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>, where believers are warned not to grieve the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's presence in the Old Testament is seen as guiding and empowering, as in the anointing of leaders like Moses and David. The rebellion can be understood in the context of Israel's covenant relationship with God, where obedience was expected in return for His blessings and protection.<p><b>So He turned and became their enemy,</b><br>This phrase reflects the consequences of Israel's rebellion. God's turning against His people is a theme found in the covenant curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to divine judgment. The idea of God becoming an enemy is a reversal of His role as protector and provider. Historically, this manifested in events like the Babylonian exile, where God allowed foreign nations to conquer Israel as a form of discipline. This turning is not arbitrary but a response to persistent sin, emphasizing God's justice and holiness. It serves as a warning that God's patience has limits and that persistent rebellion leads to severe consequences.<p><b>and He Himself fought against them.</b><br>This phrase underscores the active role God takes in disciplining His people. The imagery of God fighting against Israel is reminiscent of the divine warrior motif, where God is depicted as a mighty warrior defending His people or, in this case, executing judgment. Instances of God fighting against Israel can be seen in the defeat at Ai (Joshua 7) and the fall of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25). This action is not out of malice but a corrective measure intended to bring Israel back to repentance. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption through Jesus Christ, who, as the divine warrior, conquers sin and death, offering reconciliation to those who turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who often rebelled against Him, leading to consequences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit of God, who is grieved by rebellion and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who responds to the rebellion of His people by becoming their adversary.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message to the Israelites, warning them of the consequences of their actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A symbolic place of testing and rebellion for the Israelites, often referenced in their history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rebellion.htm">The Seriousness of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God is not a trivial matter.

Think of <a href="/bsb/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, where Israel refused to enter the land, or <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a>, where they demanded a king. The pattern is consistent: God grants grace, the nation pushes back. <a href="/psalms/78-17.htm">Psalm 78:17</a> says, &#8220;They continued to sin against Him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.&#8221; Rebellion breaks fellowship and sets the stage for discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and grieved His Holy Spirit</b><p>The Holy Spirit is not an impersonal force; He can be &#8220;grieved.&#8221; <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a> echoes Isaiah: &#8220;And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.&#8221; Grief implies deep relational hurt. When Israel chased idols (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>) or trusted alliances instead of the LORD (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>), God&#8217;s Spirit was pained. The verse shows the Spirit&#8217;s active presence in the Old Testament, guiding and protecting the nation (<a href="/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>). Their sin saddened the very One who sought their good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So He turned</b><p>God&#8217;s turning is a deliberate response, never arbitrary. When Solomon turned from the LORD, &#8220;the LORD raised up adversaries against Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-14</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s phrase signals a pivot from protection to opposition. It reminds us of <a href="/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>: &#8220;Consider the kindness and severity of God.&#8221; The same God who saves is the One who disciplines; both actions flow from His holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and became their enemy</b><p>A sober reality: persistent covenant violation makes God act as an enemy. <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a> pictures this vividly&#8212;&#8220;His right hand was against them like an adversary.&#8221; Yet even this is a covenant act, aiming to restore. <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> warned, &#8220;I will set My face against you.&#8221; God&#8217;s enmity is judicial, not spiteful; it exposes sin so repentance can follow (<a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He Himself fought against them</b><p>The warrior imagery flips.

The passage calls us to heed the Spirit, cherish obedience, and avoid the heartbreak of grieving the One who longs to bless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/63.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Vexed his holy Spirit . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">his Spirit of holiness. </span>So St. Paul speaks of Christians as "grieving the Holy Spirit."

The rebellions of Israel against God commenced in the wilderness. They rebelled at Sinai, when they set up the golden calf; at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>); at Shittim, when they consorted with the daughters of Moab (<a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6</a>). Under the Judges, their conduct was one long rebellion (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>; <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7, 12</a>; <a href="/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1</a>; <a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>; <a href="/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>). They rebelled in Samuel's time by asking for a king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 19, 20</a>). The ten tribes rebelled under Jeroboam, and set up the idolatry of the calves at Dan and Bethel. Worse idolatries followed, and in two centuries and a half had reached such a height, that God was provoked to "remove Israel out of his sight" (<a href="/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>). Judah remained, but "rebelled" under Manasseh, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, "transgressing very much after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the very house of the Lord at Jerusalem" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). These rebellions against God <span class="cmt_word">vexed his Holy Spirit</span> - "provoked him," "grieved him," "moved the Holy One in Israel" (<a href="/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he was turned to be their enemy</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4, 5</a>). Judah had "filled up the measure of her iniquities," had gone on "until there was no remedy" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). God's indignation was therefore poured out upon her without let or stint. "He cut oft' in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he drew back his right hand from before the enemy; he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. He bent his <span class="accented">bow like an enemy</span>; he stood with his right hand <span class="accented">as an adversary</span>, and slew all that were pleasant in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire.
