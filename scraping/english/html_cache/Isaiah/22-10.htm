In ancient times, Jerusalem was a fortified city, and its houses were often built close together, sometimes even sharing walls. The act of counting suggests a detailed inventory, likely to determine which structures could be sacrificed for the greater good of the city's defense. This reflects a period of impending siege, possibly by the Assyrians under Sennacherib, as described in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-19</a>. The counting of houses also implies a sense of urgency and desperation, as the inhabitants prepared for an attack.<p><b>and tore them down</b><br>The tearing down of houses signifies a drastic measure taken to fortify the city&#8217;s defenses. This action would have been a last resort, indicating the severity of the threat. Historically, during sieges, cities would often dismantle buildings to use the materials for strengthening walls or constructing new fortifications. This reflects a willingness to sacrifice personal property for communal safety. Theologically, it can be seen as a metaphor for the stripping away of earthly attachments in times of spiritual crisis.<p><b>to strengthen the wall</b><br>The wall of Jerusalem was crucial for the city's defense against invaders. Strengthening the wall would involve using the stones and timber from the dismantled houses to reinforce weak points or build additional barriers. This action underscores the importance of the wall as a symbol of protection and security. In a broader biblical context, walls often represent salvation and divine protection, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/26.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>, where a strong city is described with salvation as its walls and ramparts. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and fortress for believers, as described in Psalms 18:2.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

Instead of repenting, Judah sacrificed its own people. Jesus would later lament a similar blindness: &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem&#8230; how often I wanted to gather your children together&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah faced opposite circumstances: walls down, people willing, God honored (<a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14</a>).

The verse warns that human calculation, sacrificial zeal, and impressive defenses cannot substitute for humble dependence on God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem.</span>--The preparations for defence are continued. The houses were numbered that some might be pulled down and others left, as strategical plans might determine. (Comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>.)

So in the later siege of Jerusalem houses were thrown down by (or, more accurately, <span class= "ital">on account of</span>) the mounds that were employed by the besiegers (<a href="/jeremiah/33-4.htm" title="For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;">Jeremiah 33:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have numbered... have broken down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye numbered</span>... <span class="accented">ye broke down</span>. The "numbering" was probably in order to see how many could be spared for pulling down. The repair of the walls with materials thus furnished was a sign of extreme haste and urgency. It would seem from vers. 7, 8 that the repairs were not begun until the town was invested. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You counted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#601;&#183;p&#772;ar&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5608.htm">Strong's 5608: </a> </span><span class="str2">To count, recount, relate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the houses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;t&#183;t&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1430;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3389.htm">Strong's 3389: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jerusalem -- probably 'foundation of peace', capital city of all Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tore them down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1471;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7791;&#7779;&#601;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
