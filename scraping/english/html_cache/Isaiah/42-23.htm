In the context of Isaiah, the prophet often speaks to a nation that is spiritually deaf and blind (<a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>). The rhetorical question emphasizes the rarity of true listeners among the people. Historically, Israel had a pattern of ignoring prophetic warnings, leading to consequences such as exile. This call to attention is a common prophetic device used to awaken the people to their spiritual condition and the need for repentance. It echoes the call of other prophets, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>), who also faced a resistant audience.<p><b>Who will listen and obey hereafter?</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of not just hearing but also acting upon God's word. The Hebrew concept of "listening" often implies obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema calls Israel to hear and love God with all their heart. The future-oriented "hereafter" suggests a turning point or a new beginning, urging the people to change their ways moving forward. This call to obedience is a theme throughout Scripture, seen in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of being doers of the word (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>). The prophetic message here is not just for the immediate audience but extends to future generations, highlighting the timeless nature of God's call to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Now the prophet pauses and throws a challenge to the hearers.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Pay attention&#8221; is an invitation to wake up spiritually, like Moses&#8217; call, &#8220;Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It implies personal responsibility; no one can heed for someone else (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase pierces complacency: &#8220;My people do not consider&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>). God asks them to face the painful facts of their sin and His just discipline.<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the same urgency: &#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-23.htm">Mark 4:23</a>), showing the continuity of God&#8217;s call across both Testaments.<p>&#8226; Paying attention means more than noticing; it means treasuring God&#8217;s word (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20&#8211;22</a>) and letting it reshape the heart (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will listen and obey hereafter?</b><p>The first question targets the present; the second projects into the future.
