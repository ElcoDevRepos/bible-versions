Molech was a Canaanite deity associated with child sacrifice, a practice explicitly condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21 and 20</a>:2-5. The use of oil and perfumes indicates the elaborate rituals and offerings made to this false god, reflecting a deep spiritual adultery. The Israelites' actions here are reminiscent of the spiritual unfaithfulness described in Hosea, where Israel is portrayed as an unfaithful spouse. The use of oil and perfumes also suggests an attempt to appease or gain favor from Molech, contrasting with the pure worship God desires, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>.<p><b>You have sent your envoys a great distance;</b><br>This phrase suggests political alliances and diplomatic missions that Israel undertook, often seeking help from foreign nations rather than relying on God. Historically, Israel sought alliances with powerful neighbors like Egypt and Assyria, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>. These actions demonstrate a lack of faith in God's protection and provision, echoing the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>). The sending of envoys symbolizes a reliance on human strength and wisdom, which is consistently rebuked throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>you have descended even to Sheol itself.</b><br>Sheol, in the Hebrew context, refers to the realm of the dead or the grave. This phrase metaphorically describes the spiritual and moral decline of the people, suggesting that their idolatry and alliances have led them to a state of death and separation from God. The descent to Sheol can be seen as a consequence of their actions, aligning with the warnings of judgment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that sin brings, a theme further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The descent to Sheol contrasts with the hope of resurrection and eternal life offered through Jesus Christ, who conquered death and Sheol (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/molech.htm">Molech</a></b><br>A pagan deity often associated with child sacrifice, worshiped by some ancient Near Eastern cultures.

The verse warns that every departure from the LORD, however enticing, marches toward death. At the same time, it beckons us to return to the only One whose covenant love rescues sinners from Sheol and restores true worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/57.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Thou wentest to the king . . .</span>--The alteration of a single letter would give <span class= "ital">to Molech; </span>and this may be the meaning even of the text as it stands. Looking to the Manasseh-surroundings of the passage, however, it is more natural to refer the words to the king, the great king of Assyria, whose religion Judah had basely and shamefully adopted. The sin of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm" title="And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.">2Kings 16:11</a>) had been reproduced by his grandson. The description that follows is that of a harlot adorning herself for her evil calling, and finds its best illustration in <a href="/context/proverbs/7-14.htm" title="I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.">Proverbs 7:14-17</a>. Looking to the previous traces of Isaiah's study of that book (<a href="/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-4</a>, &c) we may, perhaps, find in it a deliberate reproduction of that passage. The "ointment" and "perfumes" are symbols of the treasures which were lavished to secure the Assyrian alliance. The words help us to understand Isaiah's indignation at what must have seemed to him the initial step of a like policy on the part of Hezekiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/39-3.htm" title="Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from where came they to you? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country to me, even from Babylon.">Isaiah 39:3-7</a>). The words which point to the "far-off" land, to which the messengers were sent, seem almost like an echo from that king's apology.<p><span class= "bld">Even unto hell</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Hades or Sheol, the world of the dead--as the symbol of an abysmal depth of degradation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/57.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou wentest to the king</span>, Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne understand "the King of Assyria," and regard the verse as bringing forward a new subject of complaint: "<span class="accented">Not</span> only hast thou deserted me tot other gods, but thou trustest for aid, not to me, but to the Assyrian monarch."

Moreover, the King of <span class="accented">Assyria is</span> never called simply" the king."
