The Philistines inhabited the coastal regions of Canaan, and their territory was to the west of Judah. The imagery of "swooping down" suggests a swift and overwhelming attack, reminiscent of a bird of prey. Historically, the Philistines were known for their military prowess and conflicts with Israel, as seen in the stories of Samson and David. This prophecy implies a reversal of fortunes, where Israel gains dominance over its former oppressors.<p><b>together they will plunder the sons of the east.</b><br>The "sons of the east" likely refers to nomadic tribes such as the Midianites, Amalekites, and others who lived east of Israel. These groups often raided Israelite territory, as seen in the Book of Judges. The term "plunder" suggests not only military victory but also the taking of spoils, indicating a complete subjugation. This reflects a time of restoration and strength for Israel, where they are no longer victims but victors. The unity implied by "together" suggests a collective effort, possibly symbolizing the reunification of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<p><b>They will lay their hands on Edom and Moab,</b><br>Edom and Moab were neighboring nations to the southeast of Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites. Edom, descended from Esau, and Moab, descended from Lot, had familial ties to Israel but were frequently hostile. "Laying hands on" suggests control or domination, indicating that these nations will be subdued. This prophecy aligns with other biblical texts where Edom and Moab face judgment (e.g., Obadiah, <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48-49</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and elevate His chosen people.<p><b>and the Ammonites will be subject to them.</b><br>The Ammonites, also descendants of Lot, were another perennial enemy of Israel. Being "subject to them" implies a state of servitude or vassalage. Historically, the Ammonites were known for their conflicts with Israel, including during the reigns of Saul and David. This subjugation is part of a broader theme of Israel's restoration and the establishment of peace and security under divine guidance. The prophecy may also foreshadow the ultimate reign of the Messiah, who will bring all nations under His rule, as seen in the eschatological visions of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistia.htm">Philistia</a></b><br>A region located on the southwestern coast of Canaan, inhabited by the Philistines, who were often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often at odds with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, located east of the Dead Sea, frequently in conflict with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>Descendants of Lot, living east of the Jordan River, often hostile towards Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_east.htm">The People of the East</a></b><br>Likely referring to various nomadic tribes or nations east of Israel, often seen as adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>This passage illustrates God's control over the nations and His ability to use them to fulfill His purposes.

Long-standing foes are subdued, fulfilling earlier prophecies (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-19</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5-12</a>). The scene assures God&#8217;s people that His kingdom will be literal, global, and unopposed&#8212;ushering in lasting peace after righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">They shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines . . .</span>--The English version is ambiguous, and half suggests the thought that the Philistines should bear the returning Israelites as on their shoulders; so the LXX. gives, "And they shall speed their wings in the ships of the aliens." What is meant, however, is that the returning exiles shall <span class= "ital">swoop down, </span>as a bird of prey after its flight, "upon the <span class= "ital">shoulder </span>of the Philistines," that name being applied (as in <a href="/ezekiel/25-9.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,">Ezekiel 25:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/15-10.htm" title="And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:">Joshua 15:10</a>) to the shape of the seaward- sloping country occupied by that people. From this victorious onset in the West, they are to pass on to "the children of the East," the generic name for the nomadic tribes that are found associated with the Midianites and Amalekites (<a href="/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>; <a href="/judges/6-33.htm" title="Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.">Judges 6:33</a>; <a href="/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>), and in <a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>, with the Philistines themselves, and then to complete their triumph by avenging themselves on their old enemies of Edom, and Moab, and Ammon. The whole verse is singularly characteristic of what has been already spoken of as the limitation of prophetic knowledge. The seer has had revealed to him the glory of the Messianic kingdom as a restored Eden, full of the knowledge of Jehovah, the Gentiles seeking light and salvation from it. Suddenly he blends this with anticipations that belong to the feelings and complications of his own time. He sees Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, in that far future. They will be then, as they were in his own times, the persistent foes of Israel (comp. <a href="/context/zephaniah/2-7.htm" title="And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.">Zephaniah 2:7-9</a>), but will be, at last, subdued. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - THE UNITED CHURCH SHALL TRIUMPH OVER ITS ENEMIES. PHYSICAL OBSTACLES TO ITS UNION GOD WILL REMOVE. Israel's most persistent enemies had been the border-nations of the Philistines, the Edomites, the Arabs, Moab and Ammon. These are now taken as types of the enemies of the Church, and victory over them is promised (ver. 14). A further promise is made that physical difficulties shall not prevent the return of the Jewish exiles from distant countries (vers. 15, 16). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines</span>. It is not to be supposed that actual war is intended. The subjects of the Prince of Peace will not draw the sword. But the Church will for many centuries be confronted by enemies, and must contend with them with legitimate weapons. It is this warfare of which Isaiah now speaks. The united Church will be strong enough to assail her enemies on all sides, and will "swoop" upon the border country of the Philistines like a bird of prey. <span class="cmt_word">They shall spoil them of the east</span>; or, <span class="accented">the Bent Kedem</span>. The phrase is commonly used in an ethnic sense of the nomadic Arabs inhabiting the deserts east of Jordan, beyond the Ammonite and Moabite country, from whose raids Palestine frequently suffered (see <a href="/jeremiah/49-28.htm">Jeremiah 49:28, 29</a>;
