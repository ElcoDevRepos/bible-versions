In biblical symbolism, vipers often represent deceit and danger (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7, 23</a>:33). The imagery of hatching eggs suggests that sin, when nurtured, leads to inevitable destruction. The context of <a href="/isaiah/59.htm">Isaiah 59</a> highlights the pervasive sinfulness and moral decay of the people, emphasizing that their actions are breeding grounds for further evil.<p><b>and weave a spider&#8217;s web.</b><br>The spider&#8217;s web represents the intricate and deceptive nature of sin. Just as a web is designed to ensnare prey, sinful actions entrap individuals in a cycle of deceit and destruction. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to webs as symbols of fragility and futility (<a href="/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel, where spiders were common, would make this metaphor particularly vivid and relatable.<p><b>Whoever eats their eggs will die;</b><br>This phrase underscores the deadly consequences of engaging with sin. Eating the eggs signifies partaking in or being complicit with sinful actions, leading to spiritual death. The concept of death as a result of sin is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The warning is clear: involvement in sin, even indirectly, results in severe consequences.<p><b>crack one open, and a viper is hatched.</b><br>The act of cracking open an egg and finding a viper illustrates the hidden dangers of sin. What may seem harmless or insignificant can reveal itself to be deadly. This imagery serves as a warning about the deceptive nature of sin, which often appears benign but ultimately leads to destruction. The prophetic nature of Isaiah&#8217;s message is evident here, as it calls for awareness and repentance to avoid the dire outcomes of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
