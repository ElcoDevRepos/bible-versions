The "former things" refer to events and prophecies that have already come to pass, demonstrating God's control over history. This can be connected to the fulfillment of earlier prophecies in Isaiah, such as the Assyrian invasion and the deliverance of Jerusalem. It underscores the reliability of God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>, where a true prophet's words are confirmed by their fulfillment.<p><b>and now I declare new things</b><br>Here, God is introducing new revelations and future events. This declaration signifies a shift from past events to future promises, highlighting God's ongoing involvement in the world. The "new things" can be seen as the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>. This also points to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, which includes the inclusion of the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<p><b>Before they spring forth I proclaim them to you.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's omniscience and the prophetic nature of His declarations. By proclaiming events before they occur, God demonstrates His foreknowledge and the certainty of His plans. This is a hallmark of biblical prophecy, distinguishing the God of Israel from idols, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-23</a>. The phrase also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who fulfills numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, affirming the trustworthiness of God's word and His ultimate plan for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9).

After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9 - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the former things are come to pass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> former prophecies have been fulfilled.
