The act of spreading out hands can symbolize both an act of surrender and an attempt to exert control. In the context of Isaiah, it suggests God&#8217;s sovereign power over the nations, particularly Moab, which is the subject of judgment in this chapter. The imagery of spreading hands is reminiscent of God&#8217;s authority and the futility of human resistance against divine will.<p><b>as a swimmer spreads his arms to swim</b><br>The comparison to a swimmer emphasizes the futility of human efforts against God&#8217;s judgment. Just as a swimmer uses their arms to navigate through water, the people of Moab attempt to navigate their own destiny. However, this effort is in vain against the overwhelming power of God. This imagery also highlights the thoroughness and inevitability of divine judgment, as a swimmer is enveloped by water, so too are the nations enveloped by God&#8217;s will.<p><b>His pride will be brought low</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with rebellion against God. In this context, Moab&#8217;s pride represents its self-reliance and arrogance. The bringing low of pride is a common biblical motif, seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction. This phrase underscores the humbling of nations and individuals who exalt themselves against God, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God opposing the proud but giving grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>despite the skill of his hands</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility of human skill and effort when set against divine judgment. The "skill of his hands" can refer to human achievements, craftsmanship, or military prowess. Despite these abilities, they are insufficient to withstand God&#8217;s purposes. This echoes the biblical theme that human wisdom and strength are ultimately powerless before God, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>, where the wisdom of God is contrasted with human wisdom. The phrase serves as a reminder of the limitations of human capability in the face of divine sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as the one who will bring judgment and humility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25</a> includes Moab as a symbol of pride and opposition to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers this message, serving as God's mouthpiece to convey His plans and purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proud.htm">The Proud</a></b><br>Represents those who rely on their own strength and cunning, opposing God's will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_swimmer.htm">The Swimmer</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe the action of God in dealing with the proud, emphasizing effort and determination.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_pride.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Pride</a></b><br>God is depicted as actively working against human pride, demonstrating His ultimate authority and control over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_cunning.htm">The Futility of Human Cunning</a></b><br>The "trickery of their hands" highlights the futility of relying on human wisdom and schemes against God's plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_humility.htm">The Call to Humility</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to embrace humility, recognizing that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_divine_justice.htm">The Inevitability of Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's actions are certain and decisive, reminding us that His justice will prevail over human arrogance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_metaphor_of_the_swimmer.htm">The Metaphor of the Swimmer</a></b><br>The imagery of a swimmer emphasizes the thoroughness and determination with which God will address pride, encouraging believers to trust in His perfect judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Isaiah_25_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Isaiah 25:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_25_11_God_s_power_vs_pride.htm">How does Isaiah 25:11 illustrate God's power over human pride and rebellion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_pride_in_Isaiah_25_11.htm">What actions can we take to avoid the pride described in Isaiah 25:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_25_11_and_pride_judgment_links.htm">How does Isaiah 25:11 connect with other scriptures about God's judgment on pride?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Isaiah_25_11_inspire_humility.htm">In what ways can Isaiah 25:11 inspire humility in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Isaiah_25_11_to_today_s_issues.htm">How can we apply the lessons from Isaiah 25:11 to modern societal issues?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_25_11_on_God_s_judgment_pride.htm">What does Isaiah 25:11 reveal about God's judgment and human pride?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Isaiah_25_11_in_God_s_salvation_plan.htm">How does Isaiah 25:11 fit into the broader context of God's plan for salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_events_does_Isaiah_25_11_reference.htm">What historical events might Isaiah 25:11 be referencing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_isaiah_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Isaiah 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_ai.htm">What does the Bible say about artificial intelligence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_will_empty_words_comfort_me.htm">What does the Bible mention about Lebanon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_are_biblical_reasons_for_divorce.htm">What does executing great judgment mean in Ezekiel 25:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/which_'lofty_city'_is_in_isaiah_26_5.htm">In Isaiah 26:5, which specific 'lofty city' is being referenced, and where is the archaeological evidence for its destruction?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Isaiah 25:11 Mean</div><b>He will spread out his hands within it</b><p>&#8226;

Each view has the support of commentators. The last seems beyond question most in harmony with the context. Ineffective struggles for preservation naturally suggest the parallel, "like some strong swimmer in his agony" (<a href="/context/psalms/69-1.htm" title="Save me, O God; for the waters are come in to my soul.">Psalm 69:1-2</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-14.htm" title="Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.">Psalm 69:14</a>).
