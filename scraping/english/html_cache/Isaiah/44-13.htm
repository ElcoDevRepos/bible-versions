In ancient times, craftsmen were skilled artisans who took great care in their work. The measuring line signifies the beginning of the process, ensuring that the idol is crafted to exact specifications. This reflects the futility of idol worship, as it contrasts with the divine creation of the universe, which required no such human tools or measurements (Genesis 1).<p><b>he marks it out with a stylus;</b><br>The use of a stylus indicates the detailed design work involved in idol creation. A stylus was a tool used for engraving or marking, suggesting that the idol is carefully planned and crafted. This meticulous attention to detail underscores the irony of idol worship, as these man-made objects are revered despite their human origin. The act of marking also parallels the divine act of writing the law on tablets, yet here it is used for a purpose contrary to God's commandments (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>).<p><b>he shapes it with chisels and outlines it with a compass.</b><br>Chisels and compasses were common tools in ancient craftsmanship, used to carve and shape materials. This phrase emphasizes the human effort and skill involved in creating idols, contrasting with the effortless power of God in creation. The use of these tools highlights the artificial nature of idols, which are crafted from lifeless materials. This serves as a reminder of the prophetic warnings against idolatry, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>, where idols are described as lifeless and powerless.<p><b>He fashions it in the likeness of man,</b><br>Creating idols in human likeness reflects the tendency to anthropomorphize deities, making them relatable and tangible. This practice was common in many ancient cultures, where gods were often depicted in human form. Theologically, this contrasts with the biblical teaching that humans are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), not the other way around. The creation of idols in human likeness is a distortion of this truth, as it elevates the created above the Creator.<p><b>like man in all his glory,</b><br>This phrase suggests that the idol is crafted to reflect human ideals of beauty and glory. It highlights the human desire to create something admirable and worthy of worship. However, this pursuit of glory is misplaced, as true glory belongs to God alone (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). The emphasis on human glory in idol creation serves as a critique of human pride and the tendency to seek glory apart from God.<p><b>that it may dwell in a shrine.</b><br>The purpose of the idol is to reside in a shrine, a designated place of worship. This reflects the cultural and religious practices of the time, where shrines were built to house idols and facilitate worship. Theologically, this contrasts with the biblical understanding of God's presence, which is not confined to man-made structures (<a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a>). The dwelling of idols in shrines underscores their limitations and the futility of seeking divine presence in lifeless objects.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/woodworker.htm">Woodworker</a></b><br>Represents the craftsman or idol maker who uses his skills to create idols from wood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/measuring_line,_stylus,_chisels,_compass.htm">Measuring Line, Stylus, Chisels, Compass</a></b><br>Tools used by the craftsman to design and shape the idol, symbolizing human effort and precision in creating false gods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/man_in_all_his_glory.htm">Man in All His Glory</a></b><br>The idol is made in the likeness of a human, reflecting human attributes and glory, yet lacking divine power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shrine.htm">Shrine</a></b><br>The place where the idol is placed, signifying the worship and reverence given to man-made objects instead of the true God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message, warning against idolatry and calling people back to worship the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_folly_of_idolatry.htm">The Folly of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a futile endeavor, as it involves worshiping the creation rather than the Creator.

Every measured line and polished curve reveals not artistic genius but spiritual folly. While the craftsman elevates &#8220;man in all his glory,&#8221; God alone is worthy of worship; His glory neither fades nor dwells in wooden shrines but fills heaven and earth (<a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The carpenter.</span>--The wooden idol comes next. First there is the rough measurement with the "rule;" then the artificer draws the outline of the figure in red chalk. "Plane" and "compasses" come in to make the form more definite. The human figure is complete; then there is the artist's final touch to add the element of beauty; and so it is ready for the "house," or <span class= "ital">temple.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The carpenter</span>, etc. When the smith has done his part in the formation of tools, the carpenter is called into action. His proceedings are traced "extragressively." (Delitzsch). First, he is regarded as in possession of his block of wood. On this he proceeds to stretch out his rule, to obtain the idol's length and breadth. Then he marks out on the block a rough outline with red chalk (<span class="accented">sered</span>). After this he pares away the superfluous wood with planes, or chisels, and marks out the limbs more accurately with the compass, planing and measuring until he has brought the rough block into the figure of a man, and impressed on it something of the beauty of a man, so that it may seem worthy of remaining in the place where it is set up, whether temple or private house. But there is something necessarily anterior to all this. To obtain his block, the carpenter must first cut down a tree, or have one cut down for him (ver. 14); to obtain a tree, he (or some one for him) must have planted it; for the tree to have grown to a fitting size, the rain must have watered it. So the very existence of these wooden idols depends ultimately on whether it has rained or not - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whether God has given his rain or withheld it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/44-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The woodworker</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;ra&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">extends</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5186.htm">Strong's 5186: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch out, spread out, extend, incline, bend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a measuring line;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1493;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6957.htm">Strong's 6957: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cord, for, measuring, a rule, a rim, a musical string, accord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he marks it out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
