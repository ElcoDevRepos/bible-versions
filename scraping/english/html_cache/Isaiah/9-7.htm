The concept of an unending government contrasts with the temporal and often tumultuous reigns of earthly kings. The promise of peace is significant, as it reflects the Hebrew concept of "shalom," which encompasses wholeness and harmony. This eternal peace is a fulfillment of the covenant promises made to Israel, pointing to a future where the Messiah's rule brings ultimate reconciliation and order.<p><b>He will reign on the throne of David and over his kingdom,</b><br>This phrase connects the prophecy to the Davidic Covenant found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever. The Messiah is thus identified as a descendant of David, fulfilling the Jewish expectation of a king who would restore Israel. This lineage is confirmed in the genealogies of Jesus found in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, establishing Him as the rightful heir to David's throne.<p><b>to establish and sustain it with justice and righteousness</b><br>Justice and righteousness are central themes in the prophetic literature, often associated with the ideal king. In the ancient Near East, a king was expected to uphold these virtues to ensure the well-being of his people. The Messiah's reign is characterized by perfect justice and righteousness, reflecting God's own nature and fulfilling the prophetic visions of a restored and just society as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>.<p><b>from that time and forevermore.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of the Messiah's kingdom. Unlike earthly kingdoms that rise and fall, the Messiah's reign is perpetual. This eternal aspect is echoed in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where the Son of Man is given an everlasting dominion. The concept of an eternal kingdom is a cornerstone of eschatological hope, promising believers a future where God's rule is fully realized.<p><b>The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this.</b><br>The term "zeal" refers to God's passionate commitment to fulfill His promises. The "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power, as He commands the armies of heaven. This assurance that God's own zeal will bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy provides confidence that the establishment of the Messiah's kingdom is not dependent on human effort but on divine initiative. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah</a></b><br>The prophesied ruler whose government and peace will have no end.
