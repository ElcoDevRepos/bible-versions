The "former things" refer to past events that God had previously revealed through His prophets. This highlights the prophetic nature of God's word, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>, where God declares new things before they spring into being. The ability to foretell events is a testament to God's control over history and His divine plan. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>they came out of My mouth and I proclaimed them.</b><br>This indicates the divine origin of the prophecies. The phrase "came out of My mouth" underscores the authority and power of God's word, similar to the creative power seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks creation into existence. The act of proclamation signifies the intentional communication of God's will to His people, often through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others. This also connects to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word of God (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>), who embodies the ultimate revelation of God's will.<p><b>Suddenly I acted,</b><br>The suddenness of God's action highlights His ability to intervene in human history at His discretion. This can be seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, where God acted decisively to fulfill His promises (<a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29-42</a>). It also points to the unexpected nature of God's interventions, which often catch people by surprise, as seen in the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who fulfilled prophecies in ways that were not anticipated by many of His contemporaries.<p><b>and they came to pass.</b><br>This phrase confirms the reliability and certainty of God's word. When God declares something, it is as good as done, reflecting His faithfulness and omnipotence. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God states that His word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires. The fulfillment of God's promises throughout scripture, from the Abrahamic covenant to the coming of Christ, assures believers of the trustworthiness of God's future promises, including the return of Christ and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

This reaches back to promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-16</a>) and prophecies of deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>). Isaiah had earlier quoted the Lord saying, &#8220;I declared the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>), underscoring that nothing catches God off-guard. His foretelling is not guesswork; it is certain knowledge rooted in His sovereign rule (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They came out of My mouth and I proclaimed them</b><p>The emphasis shifts from foreknowledge to verbal revelation. What God verbalizes carries His full authority: &#8220;so is My word that goes out from My mouth; it will not return to Me empty&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The same creative speech that brought light into being (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) also delivers promises, warnings, and hope.<p>&#8226; Prophets like Jeremiah could testify, &#8220;The LORD reached out His hand and touched my mouth and said&#8230; &#8216;I have put My words in your mouth&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later affirms, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The proclamation carries divine weight because it issues directly from the mouth of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Suddenly I acted</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s interventions often arrive with startling speed. Egypt&#8217;s army was crushed in a single night (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-27</a>). Assyria&#8217;s forces fell overnight before Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>). God&#8217;s timing can feel delayed to human eyes, yet when the appointed moment comes, His action is swift (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). This suddenness highlights both His patience in waiting and His power in executing judgment or deliverance the instant He chooses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they came to pass</b><p>Fulfillment seals God&#8217;s credibility. Not one word He utters fails: &#8220;Not one of all the LORD&#8217;s good promises to Israel failed; every one was fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>). Centuries later, the apostle would write, &#8220;For no matter how many promises God has made, they are &#8216;Yes&#8217; in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). From Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>) to the coming of the Suffering Servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>), history marches in lockstep with divine decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3</a> weaves together four unbreakable strands: God foreknows, God speaks, God acts, and God fulfills. The verse invites trust that every word God has uttered&#8212;about judgment, mercy, and salvation&#8212;will unfold exactly as proclaimed, in His perfect timing, with unshakeable certainty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">I have declared . . .</span>--Once more, for the seventh time, the prophet presses the fact of the Divine foreknowledge, not, as before, against the "no-faith" of the heathen, but against the "little faith" of Judah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have declared the former things from the beginning</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9, 10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7, 8</a>, etc.). "Former things" are here contrasted with the "new things" of ver. 6. Two cycles of prophecy seem to be intended - one of comparatively ancient date, the other quite fresh - both equally showing forth the power of God and his infinite superiority to the idols. It is difficult to determine what the two cycles of prophecy are. Delitzsch suggests that "the former things are the events experienced by the people from the very earliest times down to the times of Cyrus," while "the new things embrace the redemption of Israel from Babylon, the glorification of the people in the midst of a world of nations converted to the God of Israel, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth." Dr. Kay thinks that the "former things" are those mentioned in the prophecies concerning Babylon generally, the "new things those about to be announced in <a href="/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49-56</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I did them suddenly</span>;
