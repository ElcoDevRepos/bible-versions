The "anger of the LORD" is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with covenant violations. God's anger is not arbitrary but is a reaction to the people's failure to uphold their part of the covenant. This reflects the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin. The phrase also echoes the warnings given through the prophets, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>His hand is raised against them to strike them down.</b><br>The imagery of God's "hand" being raised is a metaphor for impending judgment and action. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the hand was often a symbol of power and authority. This phrase suggests that God is actively involved in the judgment process, not as a passive observer but as an active participant. The raising of the hand signifies readiness to execute judgment, similar to a warrior preparing to strike. This can be connected to other instances in scripture where God's hand is mentioned in the context of deliverance or judgment, such as in <a href="/exodus/7-5.htm">Exodus 7:5</a> during the plagues of Egypt.<p><b>The mountains quake,</b><br>The quaking of mountains is a powerful image of divine intervention and is often associated with theophany, where God reveals Himself in a dramatic way. This imagery is reminiscent of the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), where the mountain trembled at God's presence. It signifies the magnitude of God's power and the seriousness of His judgment. In a broader biblical context, earthquakes are often used as signs of God's presence and action, as seen in <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>.<p><b>and the corpses lie like refuse in the streets.</b><br>This graphic depiction underscores the severity of the judgment. The image of corpses lying like refuse indicates a complete and devastating defeat, often associated with the aftermath of a battle or siege. In the historical context, this could refer to the Assyrian or Babylonian invasions, where cities were left in ruins and bodies were left unburied, a sign of utter desolation and disgrace. This serves as a stark warning of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;</b><br>This phrase highlights the persistence of God's anger due to the continued unrepentance of the people. It suggests that the judgment experienced is not the end but a call to repentance. The idea that God's anger is not turned away despite the calamity reflects the depth of the people's rebellion and the seriousness of their sin. This is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>, where repeated judgments are described as opportunities for repentance that go unheeded.<p><b>His hand is still upraised.</b><br>The repetition of the imagery of God's hand being upraised emphasizes the ongoing nature of the judgment. It indicates that the opportunity for repentance remains, but the threat of further judgment is imminent. This serves as a warning and a call to return to God. Theologically, it reflects God's patience and desire for His people to return to Him, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is expressing His righteous anger against His people due to their disobedience and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, chosen by God, yet often rebellious and idolatrous, leading to divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic of stability and strength, yet they quake under God's judgment, indicating the severity of His wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corpses_in_the_streets.htm">Corpses in the Streets</a></b><br>A vivid image of the consequences of God's judgment, showing the devastation and death resulting from Israel's sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of warning and judgment to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not a trivial matter to God.

But now for the first time a terrible invasion, in which many nations will participate, is clearly announced. At first the imagery is obscure (ver. 25), but it soon grows more distinct. "Nations" are summoned to the attack; a vast army comes, and comes" with speed swiftly" (ver. 26); then their array is described (vers. 27, 28); and finally their ravin is compared to that of lions, and their success in catching and carrying off their prey is prophesied (ver. 29). In the last verse of the chapter the prophet falls back into vaguer imagery, comparing the roar of the invaders to the roaring of the sea, and the desolated land to one seen under the gloom of a preternatural darkness (ver. 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The threats of this verse are all vague and general, for there is no reason to suppose that the phrase," the hills did tremble, "refers to an actual earthquake.
