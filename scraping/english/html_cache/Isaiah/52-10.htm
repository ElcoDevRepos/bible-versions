In ancient times, the arm symbolized strength and power. The "holy arm" indicates divine intervention, emphasizing God's purity and righteousness in His actions. This imagery is often associated with deliverance and salvation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, where God promises to deliver Israel with an "outstretched arm." The baring of the arm suggests preparation for battle or significant action, highlighting God's active role in the redemption of His people.<p><b>in the sight of all the nations;</b><br>This indicates the universal scope of God's actions. The deliverance and salvation God provides are not limited to Israel but are meant to be witnessed by all nations. This reflects the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. It underscores the theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and His plan for global redemption, which is further fulfilled in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>all the ends of the earth will see</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive reach of God's salvation. "All the ends of the earth" suggests that no part of the world is excluded from witnessing God's mighty acts. This is prophetic of the spread of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples are commanded to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." It highlights the inclusivity of God's salvation plan, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.<p><b>the salvation of our God.</b><br>The term "salvation" here refers to deliverance from oppression and sin. In the immediate context, it likely points to the return from Babylonian exile, but it also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ. The phrase "our God" personalizes the relationship between God and His people, affirming His faithfulness and covenantal promises. This salvation is not just physical but spiritual, culminating in the redemptive work of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where salvation is offered to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who reveals His power and salvation to the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_arm.htm">Holy Arm</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and might, often used to signify divine intervention and deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to all the peoples of the world, beyond just Israel, indicating the universal scope of God's salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ends_of_the_earth.htm">Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>A phrase denoting the farthest reaches of the world, emphasizing the global impact of God's actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_of_our_god.htm">Salvation of our God</a></b><br>The deliverance and redemption that God provides, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_revealed.htm">God's Power Revealed</a></b><br>God's "holy arm" signifies His power and authority.

Believers can trust in His strength and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_salvation.htm">Universal Salvation</a></b><br>The message of salvation is not limited to Israel but extends to all nations. This calls Christians to participate in the Great Commission, sharing the gospel with all people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_in_christ.htm">Fulfillment in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God's salvation.

Believers can live with confidence in God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_worship.htm">Call to Worship</a></b><br>Recognizing God's mighty acts should lead to worship and adoration.
