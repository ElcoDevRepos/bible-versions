The "days of old" refers to the time of the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history when God delivered His people from Egyptian bondage. This remembrance serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of God's past faithfulness. The mention of Moses highlights his role as a mediator and leader, chosen by God to guide Israel. This period is often seen as a type of Christ, with Moses prefiguring Jesus as a deliverer and mediator of a new covenant.<p><b>Where is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherds of His flock?</b><br>This question recalls the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, a pivotal event demonstrating God's power and protection. The "shepherds of His flock" likely refers to Moses and Aaron, who led the Israelites like shepherds guiding sheep. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of God as the ultimate Shepherd, a role later fulfilled by Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd. The crossing of the sea is a type of baptism, symbolizing salvation and the transition from slavery to freedom.<p><b>Where is the One who set His Holy Spirit among them,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the presence and work of the Holy Spirit in the midst of Israel during their wilderness journey. The Holy Spirit's role in guiding, empowering, and sanctifying God's people is a consistent theme throughout Scripture. In the Old Testament, the Spirit's presence was often associated with specific leaders or prophets, but here it is noted as being among the people collectively. This foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, where the Spirit is given to all believers, marking the new covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage.

Memory becomes a spiritual wake-up call, stirring hearts that have drifted (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The days of Moses&#8221; are not fairy-tale nostalgia; they are literal, historical acts of God&#8212;events that define the nation&#8217;s identity (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By recalling God&#8217;s former deliverances, Isaiah invites the people&#8212;and us&#8212;to measure present troubles against past faithfulness (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>Key takeaway: When faith falters, Scripture urges us to rehearse God&#8217;s proven record. Remembering fuels renewed trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where is He who brought them through the sea with the shepherds of His flock?</b><p>(<a href="/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>b)<p>&#8226; The question underscores God&#8217;s unmatched power at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;31</a>). Israel&#8217;s deliverance was not by chance but by the Lord&#8217;s mighty hand.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Shepherds of His flock&#8221; points to Moses and Aaron, literal leaders raised up to guide God&#8217;s people (<a href="/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>). Their title highlights God&#8217;s tender governance: a Shepherd rescuing sheep from danger (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Asking &#8220;Where is He?&#8221; is not doubt of His existence but a plea for His manifest intervention, echoing earlier laments (<a href="/judges/6-13.htm">Judges 6:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23&#8211;26</a>).<p>Key takeaway: Past miracles kindle present hope.
