Historically, Israel was chosen by God to be His people, ruled by His laws and under His covenant. The lament here suggests a loss of that special relationship, akin to the Gentile nations who were not under God's direct rule. This can be seen as a consequence of Israel's repeated disobedience and idolatry, leading to their exile and suffering. Theologically, it underscores the importance of God's rule and the blessings that come with being under His governance. This sentiment echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>like those not called by Your name</b><br>Being "called by Your name" signifies a covenant relationship with God, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear and heal the land of those who are called by His name. The Israelites were known as God's people, a nation set apart for His purposes. This phrase indicates a profound loss of identity and purpose, as if they were no longer recognized as God's own. It highlights the spiritual desolation felt by the Israelites during the Babylonian exile, when they were removed from their land and temple, the center of their worship and identity. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of being grafted into God's family through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, where both Jews and Gentiles are called to be part of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Isaiah.
