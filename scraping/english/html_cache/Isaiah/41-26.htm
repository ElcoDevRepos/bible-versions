In the context of Isaiah, God is asserting His sovereignty and omniscience. The rhetorical question emphasizes that no other gods or idols have the power to predict or control the future. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end (<a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>). It underscores the idea that true knowledge and prophecy come only from the Lord.<p><b>and from times past, so that we may say: &#8216;He was right&#8217;?</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the reliability and truthfulness of God's word. Throughout the Bible, God&#8217;s prophecies have been fulfilled, demonstrating His faithfulness and accuracy. Historical events, such as the rise and fall of empires, were foretold by prophets like Isaiah, validating God's declarations. This phrase invites reflection on the fulfillment of past prophecies as evidence of God's trustworthiness, similar to how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>).<p><b>No one announced it, no one foretold it</b><br>Here, the text emphasizes the uniqueness of God's revelation. Unlike false prophets or idols, who cannot predict the future, God alone has the power to announce and foretell events. This is a direct challenge to the pagan nations and their deities, which were prevalent in the ancient Near East. The inability of other gods to predict the future serves to highlight the futility of idol worship and the supremacy of the God of Israel.<p><b>no one heard your words</b><br>This final phrase underscores the silence and impotence of idols and false prophets. In contrast to the living God, who speaks and acts, idols are mute and powerless. This echoes the biblical theme found in passages like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describe idols as having mouths but not speaking. The phrase serves as a call to recognize the one true God, who communicates with His people and whose words are heard and fulfilled throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.
