Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, is a central location in biblical prophecy and history, representing the spiritual and political heart of Israel. The concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, indicating those who remain faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy or judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). This remnant is often seen as a type of the faithful church, preserved by God&#8217;s grace.<p><b>and whoever is left in Jerusalem</b><br>This emphasizes the idea of survival and preservation through divine intervention. Historically, Jerusalem faced numerous sieges and destructions, notably by the Babylonians and later the Romans. The survivors of these events were often those who maintained their faith in God. This phrase also foreshadows the eschatological hope of a purified and restored Jerusalem, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, where the New Jerusalem is depicted as a place of holiness and divine presence.<p><b>will be called holy</b><br>Holiness here signifies being set apart for God&#8217;s purposes. In the Old Testament, holiness was often associated with ritual purity and moral integrity. The survivors in Jerusalem are not just physically preserved but are spiritually sanctified. This reflects the transformative work of God in the lives of His people, aligning with New Testament teachings on sanctification (e.g., <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to dwell among a holy people, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27-28</a>.<p><b>all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine registry, akin to the Book of Life mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>. Being recorded among the living implies not just physical survival but spiritual life and eternal security. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, being recorded or inscribed was a sign of importance and permanence. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/69-28.htm">Psalm 69:28</a> and <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, where being written in God&#8217;s book signifies belonging to Him and being part of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, Zion is a symbol of God's chosen people and His dwelling place.
