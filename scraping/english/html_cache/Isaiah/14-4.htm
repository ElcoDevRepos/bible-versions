In the biblical context, Babylon often symbolizes human pride and opposition to God. The king of Babylon represents oppressive rulers who exalt themselves against God. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its wealth and military might, but it also became a symbol of tyranny and idolatry. This prophecy foretells the downfall of such oppressive powers, reflecting God's ultimate justice. The use of a "song of contempt" indicates a reversal of fortunes, where the once-feared ruler becomes the subject of ridicule. This theme of divine retribution is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, which describes the fall of Babylon the Great.<p><b>How the oppressor has ceased,</b><br>The term "oppressor" refers to the tyrannical rule of the Babylonian king, who imposed harsh conditions on conquered peoples, including the Israelites. The cessation of the oppressor's reign signifies liberation and relief for those who suffered under his rule. This reflects a broader biblical theme of God delivering His people from bondage, as seen in the Exodus narrative. The fall of the oppressor is a testament to God's sovereignty and His ability to humble the proud, as also illustrated in the story of Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>and how his fury has ended!</b><br>The "fury" of the king of Babylon denotes his wrathful and destructive actions, characterized by military conquests and harsh governance. The end of his fury signifies the cessation of violence and the restoration of peace. This aligns with the prophetic vision of a future where God's kingdom brings an end to all forms of oppression and violence. The imagery of fury ending is reminiscent of other biblical prophecies, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where nations will no longer wage war. It also points to the ultimate peace brought by the Messiah, who is often seen as the Prince of Peace in Christian theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

The immediate horizon is Babylon&#8217;s fall to the Medes and Persians (539 BC; cf. <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30&#8211;31</a>), fulfilling earlier warnings (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;song&#8221; is a taunt&#8212;a Spirit-inspired celebration of God&#8217;s justice, much like Miriam&#8217;s song after the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1&#8211;18</a>) or the triumph song over Egypt in <a href="/isaiah/30-32.htm">Isaiah 30:32</a>.<p>&#8226; Though addressed to an earthly monarch, the language also points beyond him to every proud power that exalts itself against God (<a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>).

Just as He shattered Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>), He still breaks chains today (<a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and how his fury has ended!</b><p>&#8220;and how his fury has ended!&#8221; (v. 4)<p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s &#8220;fury&#8221; was notorious&#8212;tearing nations down, burning cities, and humiliating captives (<a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).
