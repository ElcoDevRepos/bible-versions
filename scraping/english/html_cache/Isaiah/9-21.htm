Manasseh and Ephraim were both tribes descended from Joseph, and their conflict symbolizes the broader disunity among the tribes of Israel. Historically, the northern kingdom was plagued by infighting and political instability, which weakened it against external threats. This internal conflict can be seen as a consequence of turning away from God, as unity among the tribes was often associated with faithfulness to the covenant. The imagery of devouring suggests a destructive and consuming rivalry, reflecting the broader theme of judgment and the consequences of sin.<p><b>together they turn against Judah.</b><br>The northern tribes, despite their internal conflicts, unite in hostility against Judah, the southern kingdom. This reflects the historical tensions between the two kingdoms following the division after Solomon's reign. The animosity between Israel and Judah is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting in military conflicts and political alliances with foreign powers. This phrase underscores the broader theme of division among God's people and the failure to maintain unity and peace. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of both kingdoms due to their collective unfaithfulness.<p><b>Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the persistent nature of God's judgment against Israel. Despite the internal and external conflicts, the people have not repented, and thus God's anger remains. This reflects the prophetic theme of divine justice and the need for genuine repentance. The phrase suggests that the consequences of sin are not easily removed without a true return to God. It serves as a warning that God's patience has limits and that continued disobedience will lead to further judgment.<p><b>His hand is still upraised.</b><br>The imagery of God's hand being upraised signifies ongoing judgment and the readiness to continue executing justice. In biblical literature, the hand of God often represents power and authority. Here, it indicates that God's intervention is not yet complete, and further consequences are imminent if the people do not change their ways. This phrase serves as a call to repentance, urging the people to recognize the seriousness of their situation and turn back to God. It also highlights the theme of divine sovereignty, reminding the audience that God is in control and His purposes will ultimately prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Manasseh.

The literal conflicts among Manasseh and Ephraim expose the destructive power of rebellion, and the upraised hand of the Lord shows judgment is not a momentary flash but a sustained response until repentance occurs.
