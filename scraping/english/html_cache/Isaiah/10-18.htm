In biblical times, forests and orchards were signs of prosperity and abundance. The Assyrians were known for their military might and expansive territory, which brought them great riches. The imagery of forests and orchards is often used in Scripture to depict the glory and strength of a nation (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). The destruction of these symbolizes the downfall of Assyria, a theme consistent with God's judgment against nations that oppose His will.<p><b>both soul and body</b><br>This indicates a total and comprehensive destruction. The phrase "soul and body" suggests that the judgment will affect every aspect of the Assyrian empire, both its physical might and its spiritual essence. In biblical terms, the soul often represents the life force or the inner being, while the body represents the physical presence. This duality emphasizes the thoroughness of God's judgment, leaving nothing untouched. It reflects the biblical principle that God's judgments are complete and just (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p><b>it will completely destroy</b><br>The certainty of destruction is underscored here. The use of "completely" indicates that there will be no remnant or recovery for Assyria. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Isaiah's message, where God's decrees are absolute and inevitable. The historical context shows that Assyria, despite its power, eventually fell to the Babylonians, fulfilling this prophecy. This serves as a reminder of the sovereignty of God over nations and His ability to bring about His purposes despite human pride and power (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>).<p><b>as a sickness consumes a man</b><br>The comparison to sickness suggests a gradual but unstoppable decline. Just as a disease can weaken and eventually lead to the death of a person, so too will Assyria's power be eroded. This metaphor highlights the inevitability and natural progression of God's judgment. In the cultural context, sickness was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment. The imagery here is vivid, illustrating the debilitating effect of God's wrath on those who oppose Him. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the sickness of sin on behalf of humanity, offering healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this passage.

Right before this, the prophet calls those assets a &#8220;forest&#8221; that the LORD&#8217;s fire will ignite (<a href="/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, flourishing trees and fruitful fields picture stability and blessing (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). By highlighting Assyria&#8217;s &#8220;splendor,&#8221; God reminds us that no amount of earthly magnificence is beyond His reach (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: in <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a> Assyria boasts of cutting down Lebanon&#8217;s cedars; that same boastful &#8220;forest&#8221; now becomes tinder for divine judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both soul and body</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores totality. God&#8217;s sentence touches the inner life (&#8220;soul&#8221;) and the outward strength (&#8220;body&#8221;). Nothing is left intact.<p>&#8226; Jesus later echoes this thoroughness: &#8220;Fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; For a nation, &#8220;soul&#8221; points to its spirit, morale, and leadership; &#8220;body&#8221; to its people, economy, and land.

Verse 17 already promised the fire would &#8220;burn and devour&#8230; in a single day.&#8221; God keeps His word with exact precision (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Assyria did fall: first humbled at Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36-38</a>), later toppled by Babylon (<a href="/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18-19</a>). History verifies the prophecy&#8217;s literal fulfillment, affirming the reliability of Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a sickness consumes a man</b><p>&#8226; The image shifts from sudden fire to gradual wasting.

Isaiah elsewhere likens Judah&#8217;s sin to sickness from head to toe (<a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5-6</a>); now Assyria experiences the same consuming weakness.<p>&#8226; Even mighty empires can fade the way illness erodes flesh&#8212;quietly, relentlessly, irreversibly (<a href="/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18</a> assures us that God&#8217;s justice is thorough, dismantling Assyria&#8217;s glittering &#8220;forest&#8221; down to its very life-breath. Outward splendor cannot shield a nation&#8212;or a person&#8212;from the LORD who can touch both soul and body. Just as sickness wastes a man, unrepentant pride guarantees inevitable decay.
