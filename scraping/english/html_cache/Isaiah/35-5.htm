In the context of Isaiah, it points to the future restoration and redemption of Israel. The opening of the eyes of the blind is a metaphor for enlightenment and understanding, suggesting that those who were spiritually blind will come to see the truth of God's salvation. This prophecy is fulfilled in the New Testament through the ministry of Jesus Christ, who physically healed the blind (e.g., <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9:1-7</a>) and brought spiritual sight to those in darkness. The act of opening the eyes is symbolic of the revelation of divine truth and the breaking of ignorance and sin.<p><b>and the ears of the deaf unstopped.</b><br>This phrase continues the theme of miraculous healing and restoration. The unstopping of deaf ears represents the ability to hear and understand God's word, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, physical ailments like blindness and deafness were often seen as impediments to fully participating in religious and communal life. The promise of healing signifies inclusion and restoration to the community. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills this prophecy by healing the deaf (e.g., <a href="/mark/7-31.htm">Mark 7:31-37</a>), demonstrating His divine authority and compassion. Spiritually, it signifies the opening of hearts to receive the gospel, as faith comes by hearing the word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). This transformation is a foretaste of the ultimate restoration in the Kingdom of God, where all creation will be renewed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.

In the literal sense, our Lord claims these prophecies to himself and his earthly career, when he says to the disciples of John the Baptist, "Go and show John those things which ye do hear and see, the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear" (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4, 5</a>); but they have doubtless a further spiritual sense, in which they belong to the whole period of his mediatorial kingdom, and are correlative to former utterances of the prophet, in which the blinded eyes and deaf ears and stammering tongues of God's people had been spoken of and made the subject of complaint (see <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, etc.). Our Lord's miracles of bodily healing, performed during the three years of his earthly ministry, were types and foreshadowings of those far more precious miracles of spiritual healing, which the great Physician is ever performing on the sick and infirm of his Church, by opening the eyes of their understandings, and unstopping the deaf ears of their hearts, and loosening the strings of their tongues to hymn his praise, and stirring their paralyzed spiritual natures to active exertions in his service. Doubtless Isaiah, or the Spirit which guided him, intended to point to both these classes of miracles, and not to one of them only, as characteristic of the Messiah's kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/35-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1445;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the blind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;iw&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5787.htm">Strong's 5787: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be opened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tip&#183;p&#257;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6491.htm">Strong's 6491: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open, to be observant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the ears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
