In the Old Testament, God is often depicted as a father to Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). This fatherly image underscores His authority, guidance, and love for His people, despite their disobedience.<p><b>though Abraham does not know us</b><br>Here, the text acknowledges a disconnect between the current generation and their patriarch, Abraham. This may reflect a period of spiritual decline or a sense of alienation from their ancestral roots. Abraham, the father of the nation, is seen as distant, highlighting the people's need to rely on God directly rather than solely on their heritage.<p><b>and Israel does not acknowledge us</b><br>"Israel" here likely refers to Jacob, also known as Israel, the father of the twelve tribes. The phrase suggests a feeling of being forgotten or unrecognized by their forefathers. This could symbolize a loss of identity or a departure from the covenantal faithfulness expected of them. It underscores the importance of a personal relationship with God rather than relying on ancestral connections.<p><b>You, O LORD, are our Father</b><br>Reiterating God as Father emphasizes His role as the ultimate source of identity and belonging for His people. This repetition serves to affirm their faith and trust in God, despite feeling disconnected from their patriarchal lineage. It also highlights the covenant relationship, where God remains faithful even when His people falter.<p><b>our Redeemer from Everlasting is Your name</b><br>This phrase identifies God as the eternal Redeemer, pointing to His role in delivering and saving His people throughout history. The concept of redemption is central in the Bible, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ. The term "from Everlasting" emphasizes God's eternal nature and unchanging character, assuring believers of His perpetual presence and salvation. This connects to passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, which speak of God's eternal existence and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.

Abraham might disclaim his degenerate descendants, but Jehovah would still recognise them. Implicitly, at least, the words contain the truth that "God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham" (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>). He is still their Redeemer. The words may possibly imply the thought that, as in the case of Jeremiah (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/15-13.htm" title="This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.">2 Maccabees 15:13-14</a>), and Rachel (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), Abraham was thought of as watching over his posterity, and interceding for them. So, eventually, Abraham appears in the popular belief of Israel, as welcoming his children in the unseen world (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/63.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doubtless thou art our Father</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for thou art our Father.</span> This is the ground of their appeal to God. As their Father, he must love them, and must be ready to listen to them. Abraham and Isaac, their earthly fathers, were of no service, lent them no aid, seemed to have ceased to feel any interest in them. It cannot be justly argued from this that the Jews looked to Abraham and Isaac as actual "patron saints," or directed towards them their religious regards. Had this been so, there would have been abundant evidence of it. <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O Lord, art our Father</span> (comp. <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; and see also <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>).
