These individuals claimed to communicate with the dead or with spirits to gain insight or knowledge. The whispering and muttering refer to the secretive and often unintelligible incantations used in their rituals. This practice was explicitly forbidden in the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as it was considered an abomination and a direct violation of the first commandment, which calls for exclusive worship and reliance on God. The cultural context highlights a time when Israel was tempted to adopt the practices of neighboring nations, leading them away from their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>shouldn&#8217;t a people consult their God instead?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the absurdity of seeking guidance from the dead or from spirits when the living God, who is all-knowing and all-powerful, is available to His people. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promised to be their guide and protector (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The call to consult God instead of mediums is a reminder of the prophets' role as God's mouthpiece, providing divine guidance and revelation. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of seeking wisdom and understanding from God alone (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?</b><br>This question challenges the logic and efficacy of seeking wisdom from the dead, who have no power or knowledge to influence the living. It reflects the biblical understanding that God is the source of life and truth, and only He can provide the guidance necessary for living a righteous life. The futility of consulting the dead is further illustrated in the story of King Saul and the medium of Endor (1 Samuel 28), where Saul's desperation leads him to seek counsel from a spirit, resulting in his downfall. This phrase reinforces the biblical teaching that life and wisdom come from God alone, and it foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the living Word and ultimate source of life (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Why should not they do as others did, and consult the soothsayers, who were in such great demand (<a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>), as to the anxious secrets of the coming years.
