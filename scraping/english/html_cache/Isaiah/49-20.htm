The term "bereavement" suggests a period of mourning and loss, reflecting the historical context of the Babylonian exile when many Israelites were taken captive, and the land was left desolate. This imagery is reminiscent of the promise of restoration and hope found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>, where Rachel weeps for her children, but God promises their return.<p><b>will say in your hearing</b><br>The phrase indicates a direct communication and a personal experience of witnessing the fulfillment of God's promises. It suggests a future time when the people of Israel will audibly hear their descendants proclaiming their return and growth. This can be connected to the prophetic assurance in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>, where comfort is promised to God's people, and their sins are pardoned.<p><b>&#8216;This place is too small for us;</b><br>This statement reflects the anticipated growth and prosperity of the nation of Israel. The land, once desolate and underpopulated due to exile, will become too small to accommodate the returning exiles and their descendants. This echoes the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, where God promises Abraham that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars, indicating a future of abundance and blessing.<p><b>make room for us to live here.&#8217;</b><br>The call to "make room" signifies the need for expansion and preparation for the returning exiles. It implies a transformation of the land and society to accommodate the growing population. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate restoration and expansion of God's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2-3</a>, where the tent is enlarged to welcome the nations. It also foreshadows the inclusive nature of the New Covenant, where all believers, Jew and Gentile, are grafted into the family of God, as described in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
