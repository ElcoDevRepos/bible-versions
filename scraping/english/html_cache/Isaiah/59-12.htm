In the context of Isaiah, the prophet speaks to the people of Israel, who have repeatedly turned away from God's commandments. The use of "multiplied" suggests a continuous and increasing pattern of disobedience. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where the wickedness of humanity was great on the earth. The phrase "before You" indicates that these transgressions are not hidden from God, aligning with the biblical theme that nothing is concealed from His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>and our sins testify against us.</b><br>Here, sins are personified as witnesses in a courtroom, providing evidence of guilt. This imagery is consistent with the legal language often found in the prophetic books, where God is depicted as a judge. The idea that sins can testify is also seen in <a href="/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>, where the law speaks to those under it, holding them accountable. This phrase underscores the concept of divine justice, where the moral order established by God inherently reveals human wrongdoing.<p><b>Our transgressions are indeed with us,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the inescapable presence of sin in the lives of the people. It suggests an awareness and acknowledgment of their sinful state, which is a crucial step towards repentance. The phrase "with us" implies that these transgressions are not only external actions but also internal realities, resonating with Paul's struggle in <a href="/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18-20</a>, where he speaks of the sin dwelling within him.<p><b>and we know our iniquities:</b><br>The acknowledgment of iniquities indicates a level of self-awareness and confession. In the Hebrew context, "know" often implies an intimate understanding, suggesting that the people are fully aware of their moral failures. This is a critical component of repentance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a>, where David confesses his transgressions and acknowledges his sin. The term "iniquities" refers to moral perversity and injustice, which are central themes in the prophetic critique of Israel's social and religious life. This recognition is a step towards seeking God's forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book.
