Despite the harsh conditions, God provided for their needs, ensuring they did not suffer from thirst. This divine provision is a testament to God's faithfulness and care for His people. The desert symbolizes a place of testing and reliance on God, where human resources are insufficient, and divine intervention is necessary. This also serves as a reminder of God's guidance and protection, emphasizing His role as a shepherd leading His flock.<p><b>He made water flow for them from the rock;</b><br>This refers to the miraculous provision of water from a rock at Horeb, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>. In a barren land where water is scarce, this miracle underscores God's power over nature and His ability to provide for His people's needs in seemingly impossible situations. The rock is often seen as a type of Christ, who provides living water to those who believe in Him, as mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where Paul identifies the rock as Christ.<p><b>He split the rock, and water gushed out.</b><br>The act of splitting the rock signifies God's direct intervention in the natural world to sustain His people. The gushing water symbolizes abundance and the overflowing grace of God. This event is a powerful image of God's provision and is often seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual sustenance provided through Jesus Christ. The imagery of water flowing from the rock is echoed in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>, where Jesus speaks of the living water of the Holy Spirit, highlighting the continuity of God's provision from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were led out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_desert.htm">The Desert</a></b><br>Represents the challenging and barren places in life where resources are scarce.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's provision and strength, from which life-sustaining water flowed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who, by God's command, struck the rock to bring forth water.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The miraculous act of providing water in the desert, demonstrating God's care and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_provision.htm">God's Faithfulness in Provision</a></b><br>God provides for His people even in the most barren and challenging circumstances.

The literal meaning is not to be altogether excluded. We have no historical account of the journey made by the bulk of the exiles who returned with Zerubbabel; but they must almost certainly have experienced difficulties with respect to water; and it is quite possible that a miraculous supply was vouchsafed to them. Most commentators, however, are content to explain both this and the earlier passage as merely "symbolical."
