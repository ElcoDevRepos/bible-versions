In the biblical context, a "covenant with death" symbolizes an agreement or alliance with forces opposed to God, often seen as a reliance on foreign powers or idolatrous practices. Historically, this could refer to political alliances with nations like Egypt or Assyria, which were seen as unfaithful to God's covenant with Israel. Theologically, it represents a spiritual rebellion against God's authority.<p><b>we have fashioned an agreement with Sheol.</b><br>Sheol in ancient Hebrew thought is the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and separation from God. By claiming an agreement with Sheol, the leaders are expressing a belief that they can control or avoid the consequences of their actions, including death itself. This reflects a deep misunderstanding of God's sovereignty and the inevitability of divine judgment. It also highlights the futility of trusting in anything other than God for ultimate security.<p><b>When the overwhelming scourge passes through it will not touch us,</b><br>The "overwhelming scourge" likely refers to impending judgment or disaster, such as an invading army. The leaders' belief that they will be untouched reveals their delusion and misplaced confidence. Biblically, this echoes the false assurances given by false prophets who contradicted God's true messengers. It serves as a warning against complacency and the danger of ignoring God's warnings.<p><b>because we have made lies our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the deceit and self-deception of the people. Lies and falsehoods are inadequate shelters against divine judgment. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the theme of truth versus falsehood, where only God's truth provides real security. Theologically, it points to the ultimate refuge found in Christ, who is the truth and the only secure foundation. This also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus condemns the Pharisees for their reliance on human traditions over God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book and is delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is the primary audience of Isaiah's prophecies.

(Comp, <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm" title="Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.">Isaiah 28:2</a>.) The scorners think that their "lies" will give them a refuge from the danger under either form. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have made a covenant with death</span> (comp. <a href="/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>). The words are a boast, expressed somewhat enigmatically, that they have secured their own safety by some secret agreement. The exact nature of the agreement they are disinclined to divulge. <span class="cmt_word">With hell are we at agreement</span>. A "<span class="accented">synonymous</span> parallelism," merely strengthening the previous assertion. <span class="cmt_word">When the overflowing scourge shall pass through</span>. Assyrian invasion has been compared to a "flood" (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>), and to a "rod" or "staff" in <a href="/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>. Here the two metaphors are joined together. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not come to us</span>. Some means will be found - what, they do not say, either for diverting the flood, or for stemming it. <span class="cmt_word">For we have made lies our refuge</span>. Here the Divine reporter departs from the language of those whose words he is reporting, and substitutes his own estimate of the true nature and true value of that "refuge" on which they placed such entire reliance. It appears by <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6-9</a> that that refuge was Egypt. Now, Egypt was a "bruised reed," not to be depended on for keeping her engagements. To trust in her was to put confidence in "lies" and "falsehood." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/28-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;We have made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;ra&#7791;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3772.htm">Strong's 3772: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut, to destroy, consume, to covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1285.htm">Strong's 1285: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covenant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">death;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;we&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have fashioned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an agreement</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1494;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2374.htm">Strong's 2374: </a> </span><span class="str2">A beholder in vision, a compact</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
