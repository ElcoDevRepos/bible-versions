In the context of Isaiah, the people of Judah had turned away from God, engaging in practices that were detestable to Him. This humbling is a common theme throughout the Bible, where God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The imagery of being "brought low" can also be seen in the fall of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>) and the humbling of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<p><b>and man is humbled&#8212;</b><br>The repetition emphasizes the certainty and severity of the humbling. It serves as a warning to those who exalt themselves against God. This humbling is not just a physical lowering but a spiritual awakening to one's true state before a holy God. The cultural context of the time saw pride as a significant sin, often leading to downfall, as seen in the stories of Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>) and Haman (<a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>).<p><b>do not forgive them!</b><br>This plea reflects the seriousness of the people's sin and the prophet's understanding of God's justice. It echoes the imprecatory psalms where the psalmist calls for God's judgment on the wicked (<a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27-28</a>). Theologically, it highlights the tension between God's justice and mercy. While God is merciful, there are times when persistent rebellion leads to judgment, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19). This phrase underscores the need for genuine repentance to receive forgiveness, a theme central to the message of the prophets and fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's atoning work (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is the author of the book that bears his name.
