The use of "LORD" in all caps typically represents the Hebrew name Yahweh, the covenant name of God, highlighting His eternal and unchanging nature. This sets the stage for a message of significant importance, as it comes directly from God Himself.<p><b>who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine calling and purpose established before birth. The concept of being formed in the womb suggests God's intimate involvement and intentionality in the creation and mission of His Servant. This Servant is often understood as a prophetic reference to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was chosen and set apart for His redemptive work. The idea of being a servant is central to the mission of Jesus, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>to bring Jacob back to Him</b><br>Here, the mission of the Servant is outlined: to restore the people of Israel (Jacob) to a right relationship with God. This reflects the recurring biblical theme of God's desire for reconciliation with His people. Historically, Israel had experienced periods of rebellion and exile, and this phrase speaks to the hope of spiritual renewal and return. It also foreshadows the broader mission of Christ, who came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>that Israel might be gathered to Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the collective restoration of the nation of Israel. The gathering of Israel is a common prophetic theme, symbolizing unity and the fulfillment of God's promises. It points to the eschatological hope of the regathering of God's people, not only physically but spiritually, under the new covenant established through Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>for I am honored in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The Servant's mission is affirmed by God's recognition and honor. This reflects the idea that true honor comes from fulfilling God's purposes. In the New Testament, Jesus is repeatedly affirmed by God, such as at His baptism and transfiguration, where God declares His pleasure in His Son (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17, 17</a>:5). This honor underscores the Servant's faithfulness and obedience to God's will.<p><b>and My God is My strength</b><br>This phrase highlights the source of the Servant's power and ability to accomplish His mission. It acknowledges dependence on God for strength and support, a theme echoed throughout scripture. Jesus, during His earthly ministry, often withdrew to pray and seek strength from the Father (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). This reliance on divine strength is a model for believers, emphasizing that true strength comes from God alone (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is the speaker and the one who commissions the Servant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>A prophetic figure, often understood as the Messiah, who is called to restore Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, whom the Servant is tasked to bring back to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The people of God, who are to be gathered back to the LORD through the Servant's mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_womb.htm">The Womb</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's foreknowledge and purpose, indicating that the Servant's mission was ordained before birth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_purpose_and_calling.htm">Divine Purpose and Calling</a></b><br>God has a specific purpose for each of us, just as He did for the Servant.

(On the service which our Lord continually rendered, while on earth, to the Father, see <a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>; <a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>.)

This reading, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, "entirely spoils the symmetry of the verse."

The "Servant" would receive glory even by such a partial conversion of the Jews as took place through his ministry. It is never to be forgotten that all the original twelve apostles were Jews, that Matthias was a Jew, that Paul and Barnabas were Jews, and that the original Church was a Church of Jews (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41-47</a>). All that was truly spiritual in Judaism flowed into the Church of Christ, as into its natural home, and the Jewish element in the Church, if not numerically great, was yet the predominant and formative element. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/49-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
