The Lord Himself, with the same mighty hand that accomplished the Exodus, will act a second time to bring His covenant people&#8212;specifically the believing remnant&#8212;back to their land from every direction. Each geographic reference underscores the literal, global scope of this promise, affirming God&#8217;s faithfulness, power, and redemptive purposes in history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The Lord shall set his hand again the second time . . .</span>--The "first" time, implied in the "second," was obviously that of the Exodus. Then, as from a state of extremest misery, they had entered on their life as a nation, and what had been in the past should be reproduced yet more wonderfully in the future. The list of countries that follows rests in part on the fact of a dispersion already begun, as in <a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>, and <a href="/context/isaiah/43-5.htm" title="Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>, partly on the prophet's prevision of the coming years. The great kingdoms by which Judah was surrounded are all enumerated:--(1) Assyria; (2) Egypt, i.e., Lower Egypt; (3) Pathros, probably the region of Upper Egypt, of which Thebes was the capital (the name has been interpreted as "Southland," or as connected with the worship of the goddess Athor); (4) Cush, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Ethiopia, higher up the valley of the Nile, governed at this time by a warlike and powerful dynasty (see <a href="/isaiah/37-9.htm" title="And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,">Isaiah 37:9</a>); (5) Elam, often translated Persia, but probably used, with a wider range, for the region east of the lower course of the Tigris and Euphrates; (6) Shinar, as in <a href="/genesis/11-1.htm" title="And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.">Genesis 11:1</a>, the plain south of the junction of those rivers; (7) Hamath, the nearest of the hostile kingdoms (see Note on <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>); and, lastly, the "island" or <span class= "ital">coast regions </span>of the Mediterranean Sea. In <a href="/zephaniah/3-10.htm" title="From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering.">Zephaniah 3:10</a> we have traces of an Ethiopian captivity; in <a href="/ezra/2-7.htm" title="The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:7</a>, of exiles in Elam. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover</span>, etc. The first recovery was from the servitude in Egypt. Isaiah now foresees that there will be a dispersion of the Israelites through several distant lands, instead of a mere transference of them from one land to another, as in Jacob's time (<a href="/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1-29</a>). God, who brought them out of Egypt, will likewise some day "set his hand" to recover them from the various countries through which they will have been dispersed, and restore them to their own land once more. The first fulfillment of the prophecy was undoubtedly, the return from the Babylonian captivity. A secondary fulfillment may have been the gathering of so many Jews from all quarters into the Christian Church (<a href="/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-41</a>). It is possible that there may be ultimately a further fulfillment in a final gathering together of Israel into their own land. <span class="cmt_word">From Assyria</span>. Assyria is placed first because already the bulk of the Israelites, as distinct from the Jews, had been carried into Assyria by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) and Sargon (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>), and were captives there at the time when Isaiah wrote. The transportation of Israelites to the other places mentioned was subsequent to his day. <span class="cmt_word">Egypt... Pathros</span>. There was a great migration of Jews into Egypt in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>), and a steady influx for some generations under the early Ptolemies. There was also a second large migration in the time of Onias. The Jewish element in Alexandria for some centuries both before and after Christ was very considerable. Pathros was probably a portion of Upper Egypt, perhaps the Phaturite nome, which was the district about Thebes. It is mentioned as the residence of certain Jews in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Cush.</span> "Cush" here may he either the African or the Asiatic. It is slightly in favor of the African that we hear in the Acts of an Ethiopian eunuch who was a Jew in the service of Candace, Queen of the African Ethiopia (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>). And it is against the Asiatic that it was so remote. It adjoined, however, upon Elam. <span class="cmt_word">From Elam, and from Shinar</span>. "Elam" was the fertile tract of alluvial land to the east of the Tigris, between that stream and the mountains, parallel with Babylonia. Its capital was Susa, and in Isaiah's time it was an important country, frequently at war with Assyria. Shinar was an ancient name of Babylonia (<a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The word is used also by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>) and Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>). Some regard it as meaning "the land of the <span class="accented">two fleers</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>From Hamath.</span> (On this town, see note to <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From the islands of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean. During the Maccabee period, there was a gradual spread of Jews over the Western world. Alliances were made with Rome end Sparta (1 Macc. 8:1 1 Macc. 12:2-21 1 Macc. 14:20-23, etc.), and Jews became familiar with both Greece and Italy. St. Paul finds numerous Jews at Rome, and in almost every city of Greece. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
