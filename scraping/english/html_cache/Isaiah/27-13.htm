In the context of Isaiah, it points to the eschatological hope of Israel's restoration and God's ultimate plan for His people. It is a common prophetic expression indicating a significant event in God's redemptive timeline.<p><b>a great ram&#8217;s horn will sound</b><br>The sounding of the ram's horn, or shofar, is symbolic of a call to assembly, repentance, or battle. It is often associated with significant religious events, such as the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>) and the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>). In prophetic literature, it signifies the gathering of God's people and the announcement of His intervention.<p><b>and those who were perishing in Assyria</b><br>Assyria was a dominant empire during Isaiah's time, known for its conquest and exile of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The reference to those "perishing" suggests the suffering and oppression experienced by the Israelites under Assyrian rule. This phrase indicates a promise of deliverance and restoration for those who were once captives.<p><b>will come forth with those who were exiles in Egypt</b><br>Egypt, like Assyria, represents a place of bondage and exile for the Israelites. Historically, Egypt was both a place of refuge and oppression for the Israelites, as seen in the story of the Exodus. The mention of exiles in Egypt highlights the widespread dispersion of God's people and the promise of their return.<p><b>And they will worship the LORD</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the gathering is worship, signifying a restored relationship with God. Worship is central to the identity of God's people, and this phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. It reflects the prophetic vision of a unified worship of Yahweh by all His people.<p><b>on the holy mountain in Jerusalem</b><br>The "holy mountain" refers to Mount Zion, the location of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is a place of divine presence and worship, central to Jewish religious life. Jerusalem holds eschatological significance as the city where God will establish His kingdom and where all nations will gather to worship (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).

Their return is not merely a homecoming; it culminates in unified, joyful worship on the holy mountain where the Lord dwells. The verse assures that no exile is too distant and no circumstance too desperate for God&#8217;s redemptive power, pointing us forward to the ultimate fulfillment of His covenant promises and the global reign of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">The great trumpet</span> <span class= "bld">shall be blown . . .</span>--The symbolism had a probable origin in the silver trumpets which were used in the journeys of the Israelites "for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps" (<a href="/context/numbers/10-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 10:1-10</a>), and which were solemnly blown in the year of Jubilee on the eve of the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm" title="Then shall you cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.">Leviticus 25:9</a>).
