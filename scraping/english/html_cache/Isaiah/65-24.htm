It reflects the deep relationship between God and His followers, where He anticipates their needs even before they express them. This concept is echoed in <a href="/matthew/6-8.htm">Matthew 6:8</a>, where Jesus teaches that the Father knows what we need before we ask Him. The phrase also suggests a time of restored fellowship and blessing, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden, where there was direct communication between God and humanity. This anticipates the eschatological hope of a new creation where such intimacy is fully restored.<p><b>and while they are still speaking, I will hear</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's attentiveness and readiness to respond to His people. It suggests a reversal of the alienation caused by sin, where communication with God was hindered. The immediacy of God's response is a promise of His faithfulness and love. This can be connected to the New Testament assurance found in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>, where believers are encouraged that if they ask anything according to His will, He hears them. The phrase also reflects the prophetic vision of a future where God's kingdom is fully realized, and His presence is continually accessible, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God dwells with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah's ministry spanned the reigns of several kings of Judah.
