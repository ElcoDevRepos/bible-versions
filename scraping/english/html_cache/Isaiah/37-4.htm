The Rabshakeh was a high-ranking Assyrian official, sent by King Sennacherib to intimidate Jerusalem. His words were not just a political threat but a blasphemous challenge against the God of Israel. The phrase underscores the belief that God is attentive to the words and actions of nations and individuals, especially when they challenge His sovereignty. This echoes the biblical theme that God hears the cries of His people (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p><b>whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God</b><br>The king of Assyria, Sennacherib, represents the might of the Assyrian Empire, which was known for its military prowess and brutality. The phrase "defy the living God" highlights the spiritual battle underlying the political conflict. The term "living God" contrasts the God of Israel with the lifeless idols of the nations, emphasizing His active presence and power. This defiance is reminiscent of Goliath's challenge to the armies of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>), where the true battle was between the false gods and the living God.<p><b>and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard</b><br>The expectation of divine rebuke suggests a confidence in God's justice and power to act against blasphemy. The concept of God hearing and responding to human affairs is a recurring theme in Scripture, affirming His involvement in the world. This rebuke is not just for the sake of Israel but to uphold God's honor. The idea of God hearing and responding is also seen in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>, where God responds to the cries of His people.<p><b>Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.</b><br>The call to prayer indicates a reliance on God rather than human strength. The "remnant" refers to the faithful few who remain true to God amidst widespread apostasy or destruction. This concept of a remnant is significant throughout the Bible, symbolizing hope and continuity of God's promises (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). The survival of the remnant is crucial for the fulfillment of God's covenant promises, pointing forward to the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
