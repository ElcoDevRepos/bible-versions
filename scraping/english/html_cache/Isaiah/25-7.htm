It is often seen as a symbol of God's presence and the place where He establishes His kingdom. In Isaiah's time, Mount Zion was the site of the temple in Jerusalem, representing the center of worship and God's covenant with Israel. The mountain is also a prophetic symbol of the future messianic kingdom where God will reign supreme.<p><b>He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples</b><br>The "shroud" symbolizes death and mourning, a universal experience affecting all humanity. The imagery of God swallowing up the shroud suggests a powerful act of deliverance and victory over death. This connects to the New Testament, where Christ's resurrection is seen as the defeat of death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>). The act of swallowing implies a complete and final victory, aligning with the Christian hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ.<p><b>the sheet that covers all nations</b><br>The "sheet" is another metaphor for death and the separation it causes between God and humanity. It emphasizes the universality of death's impact, affecting every nation and people group. This phrase highlights the inclusivity of God's redemptive plan, which is not limited to Israel but extends to all nations. This is echoed in the New Testament, where the gospel is preached to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).

Throughout Scripture, the phrase &#8220;this mountain&#8221; consistently speaks of Zion as the place where the Lord dwells and reveals His glory (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). Because God has rooted His promises in real geography, we can be sure He will likewise fulfill them in real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will swallow up the shroud</b><p>The verb &#8220;swallow up&#8221; evokes absolute victory. Just as the Red Sea &#8220;swallowed&#8221; Pharaoh&#8217;s army (<a href="/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>), the Lord will decisively consume the shroud. Paul applies the same picture to the final defeat of death, declaring, &#8220;Death has been swallowed up in victory&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>, quoting <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). The imagery is physical and total&#8212;God does not merely loosen the shroud; He annihilates it. <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a> echoes the theme, promising that &#8220;Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that enfolds all peoples</b><p>The &#8220;shroud&#8221; is universal. Every culture, tribe, and language falls under the suffocating pall of mortality and sorrow (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This universality magnifies the scope of God&#8217;s rescue: He intends to reverse the curse for &#8220;all the families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Isaiah&#8217;s wording anticipates the Great Commission, where Jesus sends His followers to &#8220;all nations&#8221; with news of this coming liberation (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sheet that covers all nations</b><p>Isaiah restates the image for emphasis: the &#8220;sheet&#8221; is the same death-blanket, but the repetition underscores how thoroughly it smothers humanity. Yet the Lord Himself undertakes to remove it. Passages like <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25&#8211;26</a> (&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221;) and <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a> (&#8220;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes&#8221;) show the fulfillment.

He will personally obliterate the universal shroud of mortality, extending His redemption to every nation. Because God anchors this hope in concrete actions and places, we can live with confident expectation: the day is coming when death itself will be swallowed up, and life will reign unopposed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/isaiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The face of the covering</span> <span class= "bld">cast over all people . . .</span>--To cover the face was, in the East, a sign of mourning for the dead (<a href="/2_samuel/19-4.htm" title="But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!">2Samuel 19:4</a>); and to destroy that covering is to overcome death, of which it is thus the symbol. With this there probably mingled another, though kindred, thought. The man whose face is thus covered cannot see the light, and the "covering" represents the veil (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>) which hinders men from knowing God. The final victory of God includes a triumph over ignorance and sorrow, as well as over sin and death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will destroy... the face of the covering</span>. According to some, the "covering cast ever all people" is death, and the second clause of the verse is a mere repetition of the first. But, though the heads of criminals were covered when they were led to execution (<a href="/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>), yet death itself is never elsewhere called a "covering." May not the prophet have in view that "veil" or "covering" of misconception and prejudice, whereof St. Paul speaks as lying "on the hearts of the Jewish nation," and preventing them from discerning the true sense of Scripture (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>)? Certainly one of the great curses of humanity while here is its inability to see things as they really are - its colored, distorted, prejudiced, views of life and death, of this world and the next, of self-interest, duty, happiness. This "veil" is certainly to be done away; for "now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know even as we are known" (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/isaiah/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
