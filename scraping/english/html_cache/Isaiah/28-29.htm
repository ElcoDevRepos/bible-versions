This phrase connects to the broader context of Isaiah, where God is portrayed as the ultimate authority and protector of Israel. The term "Hosts" refers to the angelic armies, underscoring God's ability to execute His will. This phrase assures the reader that the message and wisdom being discussed are divinely ordained, not merely human insight. It aligns with other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a>, which also refers to God as the "LORD of Hosts," highlighting His majesty and strength.<p><b>who is wonderful in counsel</b><br>The word "wonderful" suggests something extraordinary and beyond human comprehension. In the context of Isaiah, God's counsel is contrasted with the flawed advice of human leaders. This phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the coming Messiah is called "Wonderful Counselor," pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of divine wisdom. The counsel of God is perfect and trustworthy, providing guidance that surpasses human understanding. This reflects the biblical theme that God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>and excellent in wisdom</b><br>"Excellent in wisdom" highlights the perfection and completeness of God's understanding. This wisdom is not just intellectual but practical, guiding the course of history and the lives of individuals. The wisdom of God is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, which states that the LORD gives wisdom. This wisdom is evident in creation, providence, and redemption. In the New Testament, Christ is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), further connecting this phrase to the person and work of Jesus. The excellence of God's wisdom assures believers of His perfect plan and purpose for their lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
