The imagery of a whip suggests discipline and judgment. In the context of Isaiah, this refers to God's impending judgment on Assyria, a nation He used to discipline Israel but which had overstepped its bounds. The whip symbolizes God's control and ability to correct nations, reflecting His sovereignty and justice.<p><b>as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb</b><br>This refers to the victory of Gideon over the Midianites, as recorded in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. The rock of Oreb is where the Midianite leaders Oreb and Zeeb were captured and killed. This historical event is a reminder of God's deliverance and His ability to save Israel from powerful enemies. It serves as a reassurance that God will similarly deliver His people from Assyria. The victory over Midian is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, showcasing God's power to save.<p><b>He will raise His staff over the sea</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus narrative, where God, through Moses, parted the Red Sea to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage (Exodus 14). The staff is a symbol of divine authority and intervention. By referencing this event, the text draws a parallel between God's past deliverance of His people and His future actions against Assyria. It underscores God's consistent faithfulness and His ability to perform miraculous acts of salvation.<p><b>as He did in Egypt</b><br>This alludes to the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, highlighting God's mighty acts during the Exodus. It serves as a reminder of God's power to liberate His people from oppression. The mention of Egypt connects the current situation with past deliverances, reinforcing the idea that God is unchanging and His promises endure. This historical reference also points to the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the Exodus, bringing spiritual liberation to all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly armies.
