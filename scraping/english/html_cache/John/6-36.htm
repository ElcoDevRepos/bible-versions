In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, Jesus has been teaching about being the Bread of Life, a metaphor for spiritual sustenance and eternal life. This statement underscores the continuity of His message and the importance of His teachings. It reflects the consistent theme in the Gospel of John where Jesus often reiterates His divine identity and mission.<p><b>you have seen Me</b><br>Here, "seen Me" refers to the physical presence and the miraculous works of Jesus that the people have witnessed. In the Gospel of John, seeing is often linked to understanding and believing. The audience had the privilege of witnessing Jesus' miracles, such as the feeding of the 5,000 earlier in the chapter, which should have led them to recognize His divine nature. This phrase highlights the accountability of those who have directly encountered Jesus and His works.<p><b>and still you do not believe</b><br>This phrase addresses the persistent unbelief of the people despite the evidence before them. It reflects a recurring theme in the Gospels where physical sight does not always lead to spiritual insight. The hardness of heart and spiritual blindness are common issues Jesus confronts. This unbelief fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah, which speaks of people who see but do not perceive (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's history of unbelief despite God's continuous revelations and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd following Him after the feeding of the 5,000.

That there are many words of Christ which have not been preserved to us is certain. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30-31</a>.)

Some difficulty has arisen from our not being able to find, in the previous dialogue, the exact words here quoted. Some have supposed it to refer to an unrecorded conversation (Alford, Westcott), or even to some written sentence which is now a lost fragment of the discourse. Meyer says (without answering the suggestions of Olshausen, Hengstenberg, Godet, and others), that there is no such statement in the context, and proposes to translate <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as he says it is not unfrequently found in Greek tragedians, as if it were equivalent to <span class="accented">dictum velim</span>) "I would have you told;" but there is no such usage in the New Testament, and <a href="/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a> does not seem a parallel ease. It is not at all probable that Jesus was referring to the language of <a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>, words which were addressed to a different audience - to "Jews" at Jerusalem, and uttered many months before (Lucke and De Wette). But ver. 26 shows that Galilaeans had come to see him, and had come without belief in the great sign of his spiritual nature and claims which he had already granted. They had <span class="accented">seen</span> him and his great miracles, it is true; but they simply longed in consequence for "more bread" and "more healing," not for himself. In ver. 30 he draws from them a confession that they had not seen enough to believe him. This thought recurs not infrequently. "Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known <span class="accented">me, Philip?"</span> "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed" (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The setting forth of himself ought to have induced belief apart even from works. He is so intensely conscious of the Divine reality himself, that he marvels at the unbelief of his hearers. Let them think as he does, and immediately the lifelong hunger and thirst of their souls would be satisfied. Seeing, however, is not believing in their ease; and he has already urged them to consider this lamentable spiritual blindness of theirs. The exclamation of this verse recites the obvious inference of the verses we have referred to, condenses into a sentence the spirit of what he had said, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
