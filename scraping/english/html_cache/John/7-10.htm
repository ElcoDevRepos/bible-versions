Jesus' brothers, likely referring to His half-brothers, were initially skeptical of His ministry (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). The feast mentioned is the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival held in Jerusalem, commemorating the Israelites' wilderness wanderings and God's provision. This feast required a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of the event in Jewish religious life.<p><b>He also went&#8212;</b><br>Despite His brothers' earlier disbelief, Jesus decides to attend the feast. This action demonstrates His commitment to fulfilling the Law and participating in Jewish customs. It also shows His strategic approach to His ministry, choosing the right moment to reveal Himself. His decision to go indicates His obedience to the Father&#8217;s timing and plan, aligning with His mission to reveal God&#8217;s truth.<p><b>not publicly,</b><br>Jesus' choice to go "not publicly" suggests a deliberate avoidance of drawing attention. This contrasts with His brothers' earlier suggestion that He should show Himself to the world (<a href="/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>). The public nature of the feast would have attracted many people, including religious leaders who were hostile towards Him. This decision reflects Jesus' awareness of the growing opposition and His intention to avoid premature confrontation.<p><b>but in secret.</b><br>Going "in secret" implies a level of discretion and caution. Jesus was aware of the threats against Him and the potential for conflict with the Jewish authorities. This approach allowed Him to control the timing and manner of His public appearances, ensuring that His actions aligned with the divine timeline. This secrecy also fulfills the prophetic nature of His mission, as He often revealed Himself progressively, in line with the unfolding of God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who chooses to go to the feast in secret.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_brothers.htm">Jesus' Brothers</a></b><br>They initially go to the feast without Jesus, urging Him to show Himself publicly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast.htm">The Feast</a></b><br>Refers to the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival held in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Feast of Tabernacles takes place, a central location for Jewish worship and festivals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they are a significant presence in the surrounding context, often seeking to confront or challenge Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_timing.htm">Wisdom in Timing</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates the importance of discerning the right time and manner to act.

They were thinking in worldly terms, not yet believing in Him (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus waited until &#8220;after&#8221; they left. The delay underscores His submission to the Father&#8217;s timetable, not human pressure (<a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6&#8211;8</a>; cf. <a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting is the Feast of Tabernacles, a mandatory pilgrimage celebration (<a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). Jesus honored the Law in its literal requirements (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also went</b><p>&#8226; Though He delayed, Jesus did go. Obedience to God never meant avoidance of public worship (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His movement toward Jerusalem reflects resolute purpose: &#8220;He set His face to go to Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>&#8226; By going, He positioned Himself for the Father-appointed moments that would unfold later in the chapter&#8212;teaching in the temple (<a href="/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>) and offering living water (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not publicly</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Publicly&#8221; (openly) would have meant joining the pilgrim caravans, arriving with fanfare. Instead He avoided the spotlight, resisting any messianic parade prompted by unbelief (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>; <a href="/john/7-1.htm">John 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This restraint mirrored earlier patterns: withdrawing when crowds tried to make Him king (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>) or when opposition sought to kill Him (<a href="/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>; <a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His humility fulfilled Isaiah&#8217;s portrait: &#8220;He will not cry out or raise His voice in the streets&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but in secret</b><p>&#8226; Traveling &#8220;in secret&#8221; protected Him until &#8220;His hour&#8221; would come (<a href="/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>; <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>). Timing was critical; premature arrest would disrupt the redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Secrecy here is temporary. Midway through the feast He steps forward to teach openly (<a href="/john/7-14.htm">John 7:14</a>), proving that concealment served a strategic purpose, not fear.<p>&#8226; Believers learn from this balance: wise discretion can coexist with courageous proclamation (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-10.htm">John 7:10</a> shows Jesus exercising deliberate, obedient timing. He honors God&#8217;s Law by attending the feast yet refuses to bow to unbelieving pressure or court public acclaim. Moving quietly, He protects the divine schedule that will soon lead Him to public ministry, decisive confrontation, and ultimately the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast.</span>--The words "unto the feast" are misplaced in the Received text, upon which our version is based. The right reading is, <span class= "ital">But when His brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went He also up</span>; and the difference is not unimportant. We have seen that, even with the ordinary reading, there is no ground for the frequent objection (<a href="/john/7-8.htm" title="Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.">John 7:8</a>), but it is really nowhere said that He went up to the feast at all. As a matter of fact, the special feast day--the day of Holy Convocation--was on the 15th of Tishri, the 14th being the preparation day. From the 16th to the 20th was what was called "The Lesser Festival," or "The Middle of the Feast" (<a href="/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a>), and it is at this we find Him present. (Comp. also <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not openly, but as it were in secret</span>--i.e., not with the usual company. Judging from His practice at another time (<a href="/john/4-4.htm" title="And he must needs go through Samaria.">John 4:4</a>), He would go through Samaria, while the caravan would go on the Eastern side of the Jordan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when his brethren were gone up to the</span> <span class="cmt_word">feast,</span> <span class="cmt_word">then</span> <span class="cmt_word">went he also up, not manifestly, but as it were in secret</span>. The emendation of the text is important, for it draws attention to the fact that, while the brethren went up <span class="accented">to the feast</span>, he simply <span class="accented">went up</span>, towards Jerusalem - not, however, in the pilgrim caravan, but as a quiet wayfarer, blessing lepers, comforting souls, pouring forth on a favoured few his truth, till he reached the certain village at the very gates of Jerusalem. What a contrast there was between the first visit (ch. 2.), when he appeared suddenly in the temple, and cast out the money changers, or that when (ch. 5.) he went to the "unnamed" feast as a pilgrim! The hostility has deepened; the "world" hates its Saviour, because he would save it from its sins, interpret it to itself, and offer spiritual rather than temporal benediction. The phrase, "in secret," has led some of the Tubingen school to suggest a docetic view of the Person of Christ; but the suggestion is reckless and absurd. Moulten, who conceives that the mission of the seventy disciples preceded this advent, says even this does not clash with the idea of a virtually secret and retired advance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[after]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8041;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
