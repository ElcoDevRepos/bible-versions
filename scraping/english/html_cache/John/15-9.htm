The Father's love for the Son is foundational, reflecting the divine relationship that has existed from eternity. This love is mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>, where the Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. The love is not only relational but also functional, as it underpins the mission of Jesus. The Father&#8217;s love is characterized by approval, delight, and a shared purpose, which is evident in Jesus&#8217; baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>).<p><b>so have I loved you</b><br>Jesus extends the same quality of love He receives from the Father to His disciples. This love is sacrificial, unconditional, and redemptive, as demonstrated by Jesus&#8217; willingness to lay down His life (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). The love Jesus has for His followers is a model for how they are to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). This love is also a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah&#8217;s role as a shepherd and caretaker of His people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23-24</a>).<p><b>Remain in My love</b><br>This command emphasizes the necessity of abiding in the love of Christ. To remain in His love means to continue in a relationship with Him, characterized by obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>). The concept of abiding is central to the Johannine writings, where it signifies a deep, ongoing connection with Jesus, akin to the vine and branches metaphor earlier in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. This abiding is not passive but involves active participation in the life of Christ, reflecting the covenant relationship God has with His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing His divine love and the importance of abiding in it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The source of love, whose love for Jesus serves as the model for Jesus' love for His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to remain in His love.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine_and_the_branches.htm">The Vine and the Branches</a></b><br>The metaphor used by Jesus in <a href="/bsb/john/15.htm">John 15</a> to illustrate the relationship between Him and His followers, emphasizing dependence and connection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_love.htm">Understanding Divine Love</a></b><br>Recognize that the love Jesus has for us is modeled after the perfect love of the Father for the Son.

Because Scripture is true and literal, we can rest assured that the same perfect love the Father has for Jesus is the love Jesus has for every believer&#8212;inviting us to dwell securely and fruitfully in it each day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">As the Father hath loved Me, I have also loved you.</span> He had passed from the thought of their discipleship to the foundation of their union with Him and with God. It was in the eternal love of the Father, ever going forth to the Son, and from the Son ever going forth to all who would receive it. The Father's love and presence was ever with the Son, because the Son ever did those things which were pleasing to Him. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>.) The love of the Son is ever present wherever willing heart of obedient disciple is open to its power.<p><span class= "bld">Continue ye in my love.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">abide ye in My love.</span> The word "continue" misses the connection with the context. By "My love" is meant, not "love to Me in your hearts," but, "My love towards you." The one produces the other. "We love Him because He hath first loved us;" but that which is prominent in the thought here is His love to the disciples, which He has just compared to the Father's love to Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Two ways of explaining this verse: <span class="accented">Even as - inasmuch as - the Father hath loved me</span>, <span class="accented">and as I have loved you</span>, <span class="accented">abide in my love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Grotius has put it, the first clause suggesting accordance with the mystery of the Trinity, and the second the mystery of redemption: "So do ye continue, or so do ye abide, in the amplitude of this double love which is mine, dwell in it as in a holy atmosphere, breathe it and live by it." But there is another and more satisfactory way of translating the passage<span class="cmt_word">: Even as the Father loved me, I also loved you</span>; a fact of stupendous interest and transcendent claim. Heaven had opened over the incarnate Word, and other ears as well as his own had heard the Father say, "Thou art my beloved Son," etc. The Lord was conscious of being the Object of this infinite love before the foundation of the world (<a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>), and of reciprocating and responding to it; and this love of the Father to him on his assumption of his mediatorial functions was the well-spring of his obedience unto death and after it (see <a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>, note). Now, if the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is to be translated as above, Christ declares that <span class="accented">even as</span> the Father has loved him, he has' loved his disciples. Again and again he has emphasized this love to them (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>), but here he asserts a loftier claim, viz. that his love to them corresponds with the eternal Father's love to himself. The one great fact is the ground on which he commands them to <span class="accented">abide in his love</span>. This is obviously a more explicit and more intelligible form of the commandment to abide in him. With Olshausen and Westcott, "The love that is mine "is not the love to Christ, nor the love <span class="accented">of</span> Christ exclusively, but a blending of the active and passive idea in "the love that is mine" - in the "love" lavished upon me from eternity, and to which I have eternally responded, which I have made known to you and expended on you and received back again from you. <span class="cmt_word">Abide in that love that is mine.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#952;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Kath&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2531.htm">Strong's 2531: </a> </span><span class="str2">According to the manner in which, in the degree that, just as, as.
