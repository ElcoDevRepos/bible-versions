This reflects Jesus' role as a teacher and His authority to provide divine insight. His response challenges common Jewish beliefs of the time, which often linked physical ailments to personal or ancestral sin.<p><b>Neither this man nor his parents sinned</b><br>This statement refutes the prevailing Jewish notion that suffering and physical disabilities were direct results of sin. In the cultural context, it was a common belief that ailments were a punishment for sin, as seen in Job's story and the teachings of the Pharisees. Jesus emphasizes that not all suffering is a consequence of sin, aligning with the broader biblical theme that God's ways and purposes are beyond human understanding.<p><b>but this happened</b><br>The phrase indicates a divine purpose behind the man's condition. It suggests that God can use circumstances, even those that seem negative, for a greater purpose. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to bring good out of difficult situations, as seen in Joseph's story in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>so that the works of God</b><br>The "works of God" refer to the miraculous signs and wonders that Jesus performed, which served to reveal His divine nature and authority. This phrase highlights the purpose of miracles in Jesus' ministry: to authenticate His message and mission. It also points to the broader theme of God's glory being revealed through His works, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>would be displayed in him</b><br>The healing of the blind man serves as a demonstration of God's power and compassion. It is a tangible manifestation of Jesus' claim to be the Light of the World, as He brings both physical and spiritual sight. This act prefigures the ultimate work of God in Christ&#8212;salvation and the restoration of humanity. The miracle also serves as a type of spiritual enlightenment, where physical healing symbolizes the opening of spiritual eyes to the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about the cause of a man's blindness.

Neither his special sin nor theirs was the cause of the blindness. Our version does not give quite accurately the form of the answer. It should be, <span class= "ital">Neither did this man sin, nor his parents.</span> Their question sought to establish a connection between the suffering and some definite act of sin. The answer asserts that no such connection exists, and our Lord's words remain a warning against the spirit of judging other men's lives, and tracing in the misfortunes and sorrows which they have to bear the results of individual sin or the proof of divine displeasure. There is a chain connecting the sin of humanity and its woe, but the links are not traceable by the human eye. In the Providence of God vicarious suffering is often the noble lot of the noblest members of our race. No burden of human sorrow was ever so great as that borne by Him who knew no human sin.<p><span class= "bld">But that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>--They had sought to trace back the result of sin which they saw before them to a definite cause. He will trace it back to the region of the divine counsel, where purpose and result are one. Evil cannot be resolved into a higher good: it is the result of the choice exercised by freedom, and without freedom goodness could not be virtue. Permitted by God, it is yet overruled by Him. It has borne its fearful fruit in the death and curse of humanity, but its works have led to the manifestation of the works of God in the divine plan of redemption. It is so in this instance. The blindness of this beggar will have its result, and therefore in the divine counsel had its purpose, in the light which will dawn upon the spiritual as well as upon the physical blindness, and from him will dawn upon the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents</span> (that he should be born blind). There was no immediate connection between the special sin of the parents and this particular calamity. Our Lord does not assert in those words the sinlessness of those people, but severs the supposed link between their conduct and the specific affliction before them. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (he was born blind) <span class="cmt_word">that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span> The disciples will soon see in the history of this man the meaning of his lifelong blindness. In the man himself' the grace of God will work mightily, both a bodily and spiritual illumination. Evil in this case is to redound to greater good. This provides no opportunity for any to fasten on one or another some charge of special transgression, but, as all evil ought to do, it provides opportunity for the redeeming work which Christ came to accomplish, and which he permitted his disciples to share. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Neither</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8020;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Oute)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3777.htm">Strong's 3777: </a> </span><span class="str2">And not, neither, nor.
