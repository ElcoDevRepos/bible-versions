In this context, his statement about the poor is not genuine concern but a facade. The Bible frequently emphasizes the importance of caring for the poor (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>), highlighting Judas's hypocrisy. His lack of genuine compassion contrasts with Jesus' teachings on selflessness and charity.<p><b>but because he was a thief</b><br>Judas's character is further revealed as dishonest and self-serving. The term "thief" indicates a habitual practice of stealing, which aligns with his eventual betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). This behavior fulfills the prophecy of betrayal found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where even a close friend would turn against the Messiah. Judas's actions serve as a warning against the love of money, which is described as the root of all kinds of evil (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p><b>As keeper of the money bag</b><br>Judas held a position of trust among the disciples, managing their collective funds. This role would have required integrity and accountability, yet Judas exploited it for personal gain. The "money bag" was likely used for the group's expenses and charitable acts, reflecting the communal lifestyle of Jesus and His followers. Judas's misuse of this responsibility highlights the dangers of unchecked greed and the importance of stewardship.<p><b>he used to take from what was put into it</b><br>This phrase indicates a repeated action, suggesting that Judas regularly embezzled funds. His behavior contrasts sharply with the integrity expected of a disciple of Christ. The act of taking from the money bag symbolizes a deeper spiritual theft, as Judas's heart was not aligned with the mission of Jesus. This serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness and the consequences of allowing sin to take root in one's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus.

Judas aligns with that pattern, not with the Good Shepherd.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-4</a> portrays a similar heart: Ananias and Sapphira lie about money while appearing generous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As keeper of the money bag</b><p>&#8226; The disciples had a shared purse for ministry needs (<a href="/luke/8-3.htm">Luke 8:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>).

Judas proves the principle.<p>&#8226; By siphoning funds meant for ministry, he was effectively robbing God (<a href="/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8-10</a>).

The verse warns believers to cultivate genuine compassion, practice transparent stewardship, and guard against the subtle slide from small compromise to catastrophic betrayal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) This verse which follows from the reference to Judas is of course, like it, peculiar to St. John.<p><span class= "bld">But because he was a thief, and had the bag.</span>--Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a> and <a href="/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>. We have to think of Judas as treasurer of the common fund which supplied the wants of the little band, and from which gifts to the poor were made. The word rendered "bag" here, the only passage where it occurs in the New Testament, and "chest," in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/24-8.htm" title="And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:8-11</a>, means literally the "key-chest," in which musicians carried their flute-keys. Hence it was applied to a chest in the wider sense, and especially, as here, to a small and portable chest.<p><span class= "bld">And bare what was put therein.</span>--This is but to say over again, if we take the ordinary sense of the words, what is already implied in the fact that he kept the bag. The form of the word expresses continuance of the act, and may refer to the recurring opportunities of fraud as distinct from the mere fact of carrying the chest with a known sum in it. But we may certainly render the word "bare away," for St. John himself uses it in this sense in <a href="/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.">John 20:15</a>; and this clause would then mean "and purloined what was put therein."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Judas] did not say</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
