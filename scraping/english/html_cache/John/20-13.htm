In biblical context, angels often serve as messengers of God, bringing comfort or revelation. The use of "woman" is a respectful address, common in the culture of the time. The question highlights the deep sorrow and confusion Mary feels, reflecting the human experience of grief. It also sets the stage for the revelation of Jesus' resurrection, a pivotal moment in Christian theology.<p><b>they asked.</b><br>The presence of angels at the tomb signifies divine intervention and the importance of the event. Angels are frequently depicted in Scripture as God's servants who announce significant events, such as the birth of Christ (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>). Their inquiry is not for their own understanding but to engage Mary and prepare her for the revelation of the risen Christ.<p><b>Because they have taken my Lord away,</b><br>Mary's response indicates her devotion to Jesus, referring to Him as "my Lord," a term of personal allegiance and faith. Her assumption that Jesus' body has been taken reflects the historical practice of grave robbery, which was not uncommon in the ancient world. This statement underscores her lack of understanding of the resurrection, a theme that is gradually unveiled throughout the chapter.<p><b>she said,</b><br>Mary's direct speech emphasizes her emotional state and personal connection to Jesus. Her willingness to speak to the angels shows her desperation and determination to find Jesus, even in death. This moment captures the raw human emotion and the personal relationship believers are called to have with Christ.<p><b>and I do not know where they have put Him.</b><br>Mary's uncertainty and distress are evident in her words. This reflects the historical context of the time, where the body of a deceased person was often placed in a family tomb or a borrowed one, as was the case with Jesus. Her statement also highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about His death and resurrection, which the disciples and followers did not fully comprehend until after the resurrection (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>). This moment foreshadows the revelation of the empty tomb and the risen Christ, central to the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is the first to arrive at the tomb and discover it empty.

Here we witness angelic wonder at human incredulity. Angelic ministry to human sorrow; for the mystery of our tears does not arrest the sympathy of these triumphant spirits. Often, if we are compelled to put into words the supposed cause of our bitterest agony, we deliver ourselves from our fears. <span class="cmt_word">She saith unto them,</span> as if she were speaking simply and naturally to human beings. However, Mary of Magdala alone of the women knows them to be "angels," but is so overpowered with the loss of her Lord that she does not quail or flee, but wails forth anew the language she had already uttered to the disciples. <span class="cmt_word">I weep because they have taken away my Lord.</span> That "my" makes a characteristic difference from "the Lord" of whom she had spoken to Peter and John. She did not at the instant know that her Lord was the Lord of angels.
