The presence of "the Jews" indicates a group of people, likely from Jerusalem, who were there to support Mary and Martha after the death of their brother Lazarus. This reflects the Jewish customs of mourning, which included sitting shiva, a seven-day period of mourning where friends and family gather to console the bereaved. The presence of these Jews also highlights the close-knit community and the importance of communal support in times of grief.<p><b>saw how quickly she got up and went out</b><br>Mary's sudden movement would have been noticeable to those present, indicating urgency or a strong emotional response. In the context of mourning, any abrupt action could signify a change in the mourner's emotional state or a need to perform a specific ritual. This quick departure suggests that Mary was deeply moved, possibly by the news of Jesus' arrival, which she had just received from her sister Martha.<p><b>they followed her</b><br>The act of following Mary shows the concern and attentiveness of the mourners. It was customary for mourners to accompany each other, especially when visiting the grave, as a sign of solidarity and support. This also demonstrates the communal nature of Jewish mourning practices, where the community actively participates in the grieving process.<p><b>supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there</b><br>It was common for mourners to visit the tomb of the deceased, especially during the initial days of mourning. The assumption that Mary was going to the tomb reflects the cultural practice of expressing grief at the burial site. This act of mourning at the tomb was a way to honor the deceased and express continued love and remembrance. The mourners' assumption also indicates their lack of awareness of Jesus' presence and the impending miracle, highlighting the theme of misunderstanding and revelation that runs throughout the Gospel of John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>Sister of Martha and Lazarus, known for her devotion to Jesus.

These are neighbors, friends, and religious leaders who genuinely share the sisters&#8217; grief.<p>- Mourning in first-century Judea often lasted a full week (cf. <a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>), so these visitors are fulfilling a loving, biblical duty to &#8220;weep with those who weep&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>- Their presence highlights how publicly Lazarus&#8217;s death has been acknowledged&#8212;setting the stage for an equally public miracle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saw how quickly she got up and went out,</b><p>- Mary&#8217;s sudden movement shows urgency and purpose.
