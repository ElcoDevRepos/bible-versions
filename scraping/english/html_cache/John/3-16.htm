The Greek word for "world" (kosmos) indicates the entirety of creation, highlighting God's inclusive plan. This love is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's covenant with Abraham promised blessings to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The love of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9-10</a>, which speaks of God's love manifested through sending His Son.<p><b>that He gave His one and only Son</b><br>The giving of His "one and only Son" underscores the uniqueness and preciousness of Jesus. The term "one and only" (monogenes) signifies Jesus' unique relationship with the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. This act of giving is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which foretells the birth of a son who will be called "Mighty God." The sacrificial nature of this gift is foreshadowed in the story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22), where God provides a ram as a substitute, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>that everyone who believes in Him</b><br>The invitation to "everyone who believes" highlights the accessibility of salvation through faith. Belief in Jesus is a central tenet of the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>, which emphasizes confessing and believing in Jesus for salvation. This belief is not mere intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus as Savior and Lord. The concept of faith is deeply rooted in the biblical narrative, exemplified by figures like Abraham, whose faith was credited as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p><b>shall not perish</b><br>The phrase "shall not perish" contrasts with the eternal life offered through belief in Jesus. Perishing refers to eternal separation from God, a theme consistent with the warnings found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>, where Jesus speaks of eternal punishment. This highlights the seriousness of rejecting God's offer of salvation and the dire consequences of unbelief.<p><b>but have eternal life</b><br>"Eternal life" is a central promise of the Gospel, signifying not just unending existence but a quality of life in relationship with God. This life begins at the moment of faith and continues into eternity, as seen in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where Jesus defines eternal life as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ. The concept of eternal life is rooted in the hope of resurrection and the new creation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where God dwells with His people in a renewed creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of the universe, who demonstrates His love for humanity by giving His Son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to all of humanity, emphasizing the universal scope of God's love and the offer of salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (the Son)</a></b><br>The one and only Son of God, sent into the world to provide salvation through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who place their faith in Jesus Christ, receiving the promise of eternal life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The gift of everlasting life with God, contrasted with perishing, which signifies eternal separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_god's_love.htm">The Nature of God's Love</a></b><br>God's love is unconditional and sacrificial, demonstrated by giving His only Son for the salvation of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The offer of salvation is extended to all people, regardless of background or status, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel message.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_faith.htm">The Call to Faith</a></b><br>Belief in Jesus is the sole requirement for receiving eternal life, highlighting the importance of personal faith and trust in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_salvation.htm">The Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Those who believe in Jesus are assured of eternal life, providing hope and security in the promise of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_the_gospel_message.htm">The Urgency of the Gospel Message</a></b><br>The contrast between perishing and eternal life underscores the urgency of sharing the Gospel with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_3_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 3:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_3_16_show_God_s_love.htm">How does John 3:16 demonstrate God's love for the world?

First <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a> underscores the same heart: &#8220;And this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because this love is undeserved, it assures anyone&#8212;whatever the past&#8212;that God&#8217;s arms are open.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He gave His one and only Son</b><p>&#8226; Love moves to action: &#8220;He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Gave&#8221; points to the incarnation, earthly ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a> reminds us that at the exact right moment &#8220;God sent His Son&#8230; to redeem those under the Law.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;One and only&#8221; stresses Jesus&#8217; unique relationship with the Father&#8212;no other could accomplish redemption. <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> had foretold this gift centuries earlier.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everyone who believes in Him</b><p>&#8226; The promise is universal in scope yet personal in application. <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a> states, &#8220;But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Belief is more than intellectual agreement; it is trusting reliance&#8212;illustrated when the Philippian jailer was told, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This faith is:<p>&#8211; Personal: no one else can believe for you.<p>&#8211; Exclusive: placed &#8220;in Him,&#8221; not in works or rituals (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8211; Ongoing: true faith endures and bears fruit (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shall not perish</b><p>&#8226; To &#8220;perish&#8221; is the opposite of salvation&#8212;eternal separation from God. <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a> warns that those who refuse Christ &#8220;stand condemned already.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture is clear that this fate is real and irreversible (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s love provides the only rescue from the death we earned: &#8220;For the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>a).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But have eternal life</b><p>&#8226; Eternal life is both a present possession and a future hope.

The verse announces God&#8217;s heart, His gift, our response, and the destiny that follows&#8212;assuring every believer of unfading hope in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) The last verse has spoken of "every one who believeth." The thought went beyond the limits that Rabbis set to the kingdom of God. Its only limit is humanity. This thought is now repeated and strengthened by the "might not perish," and the love of God is made the foundation on which it rests. Perhaps no verse in the Bible has been so much explained as this; perhaps no verse can be so little explained. Most young preachers have sermons upon it; older men learn that its meaning must be felt and thought rather than spoken. Still less can it be written; and this Note may not attempt to do more than indicate some lines of thought which may help to lead to others.<p><span class= "bld">God so loved the world.</span>--Familiar as the words are to us, they were uttered to Nicodemus for the first time. They are the revelation of the nature of God, and the ground of our love to God and man. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1John 4:7-11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His only begotten Son.</span>--Here, once again, the Old Testament Scriptures suggest and explain the words used. Every Jew knew, and loved to think and tell of his forefather who was willing to sacrifice his own and only son in obedience to what he thought to be the will of God (Genesis 22). But Love gives, and does not require, sacrifice. God wills not that Abraham should give his son, but He gave His only begotten Son. The dread power that man has ever conceived--that is not God; the pursuing vengeance that sin has ever imagined--that is not God; the unsatisfied anger that sacrifice has ever suggested--that is not God. But all that human thought has ever gathered of tenderness, forgiveness, love, in the relation of father to only child--all this is, in the faintness of an earth-drawn picture, an approach to the true idea of God. Yes, the true idea is infinitely beyond all this; for the love for the world gives in sacrifice the love for the only begotten Son.<p><span class= "bld">Believeth in.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">believeth upon.</span> The preposition is not the same as in the last verse. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>.) There the thought was of the Son of Man lifted up, in whom every one who believes and can interpret spiritual truth, ever has eternal life. Here the thought is of the Son of God given for the world, and every one who believes upon, casts his whole being upon Him, and, like Abraham, in will rests all upon God, finds that God has provided Himself a lamb for a burnt-offering instead of human sacrifice or death.<p><span class= "bld">Everlasting life.</span>--Better, as the same Greek word is rendered in the previous verse, <span class= "ital">eternal life.</span> For the meaning of this word see Note on <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm" title="And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.">Matthew 25:46</a>. It is of frequent use in this Gospel (seventeen times), and always used in reference to life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-21.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Divine love and judgment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God so loved the world.</span> The Divine love to the whole of humanity in its condition of supreme need, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apart from himself and his grace, has been of such a commanding, exhaustless, immeasurable kind, that it was equal to any emergency, and able to secure for the worst and most degraded, for the outcast, the serpent-bitten and the dying, a means of unlimited deliverance and uplifting. The Divine love is the sublime source of the whole proceeding, and it has been lavished on "the world." This world cannot be the limited "world" of the Augustinian, Calvinian interpreters - the world of the elect; it is that "whole world" of which St. John speaks in <a href="/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>. "God will have all men to be saved" (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). Calvin himself says, "Christ brought life, because the heavenly Father loves the human race, and wishes that they should not perish." Pharisaic interpretations of the Old Testament had left the outside world in judgment, to cursing and condign punishment, and had made Abrahamic descent and sacramental privilege the conditions of life and honour and royal freedom. Here the poor world is seen to be the object of such love, <span class="cmt_word">that he</span> - the Father-God - <span class="cmt_word">gave</span>, "delivered up," we do not know certainly to "what," but we may judge from the context that it was such a deliverance, or such giving up. as is involved in the uplifting of the Son of man upon his cross of humiliation and shame. But the Lord in,educes a more wonderful term to denote his own personality. This "Son of man" is none other than <span class="cmt_word">his only begotten Son (</span>cf. notes, <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>). Just as Abraham had not kept back his only begotten son from God, so God has not withheld his perfect Image, his Well-beloved, his Eternal Logos, the perfect ideal of sonship. He gave him with the following view: <span class="cmt_word">that whosoever believeth in him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>may not perish, but have eternal life.</span> The previous saying is repeated as in a grand refrain for which a deeper reason and fuller explanation have been supplied. Perishing, ruin, the issues of poisonous corruption, might and would, by the force of natural law, work themselves out in the destinies of men. The awful curse was spreading, but it may be arrested. None need be excluded. Looking is living. Believing in this manifestation of Divine love is enough. This is the first, high, main condition. Appropriation of such a Divine gift unriddles the mysteries of the universe, emancipates from the agelong bondage, confers a life which is beyond the conditions or occasions of dissolution. This verse is infinite in its range, and, notwithstanding a certain vagueness and indefiniteness of expression, presents and enshrines the most central truth of Divine revelation. When the terms "gave," "only begotten Son," "believeth," "life," "perishing," "God," "the world," are fully interpreted, then the words of this text gather an ever-augmenting force and fulness of meaning; and they may have been expanded to meet the prejudices of Nicodemus or the difficulties of disciples. The idea of gift and giver and the ends of the giving may have at once suggested to the Pharisaic mind the grand distinction between Israel and the world, and the inquiry may have been made - Is not Messiah, then, about to judge the world, to summon all the nations round to hear their doom? To some such heart-deadening query, to some such conscience-benumbing scepticism, our Lord continued - No; this love to the world on the part of God, this condition of faith on the side of man, thus laid down, is perfectly honest and sincere - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
