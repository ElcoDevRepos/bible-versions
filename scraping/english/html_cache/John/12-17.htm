The context is the aftermath of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, a significant miracle that took place in Bethany, near Jerusalem. The presence of many people suggests a large gathering, possibly due to the Passover festival, which drew many Jews to Jerusalem. This gathering of witnesses is crucial for the spread of Jesus' fame and the validation of His miracles.<p><b>when He called Lazarus from the tomb</b><br>This refers to the miraculous event recorded in <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead after four days in the tomb. This miracle is a powerful demonstration of Jesus' authority over life and death, affirming His divine nature. The act of calling Lazarus by name signifies Jesus' personal relationship with those He loves and His power to command life. This event foreshadows Jesus' own resurrection and serves as a type of the resurrection of believers.<p><b>and raised him from the dead</b><br>The raising of Lazarus is a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, showcasing His power over death and prefiguring His own resurrection. This miracle is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's power to bring life (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>). It also serves as a catalyst for the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, as it intensifies the opposition from the religious leaders who feel threatened by His growing influence.<p><b>continued to testify</b><br>The ongoing testimony of the witnesses is crucial for the spread of the Gospel. Their testimony serves as a form of evangelism, sharing the truth of Jesus' miraculous power and divine authority. This public declaration of Jesus' works fulfills the role of witnesses as described in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers are called to testify to the ends of the earth.

The word signals continuity: God&#8217;s redemptive plan is moving forward while human hearts respond. Similar narrative pivots appear in <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a> (&#8220;Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went&#8221;), reminding us that the gospel keeps advancing even when opposition mounts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>many people</b><p>The phrase widens the lens from the twelve disciples to a substantial number of eyewitnesses. Scripture often notes large crowds gathering around Jesus (<a href="/mark/3-7.htm">Mark 3:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>), underscoring that His works were public, verifiable events&#8212;not secrets whispered in corners (<a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>).

Their proximity gave weight to their words. It also fulfilled the pattern later commanded in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>&#8212;first-hand observers becoming bold testifiers.
