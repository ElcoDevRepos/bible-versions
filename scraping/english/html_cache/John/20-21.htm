The context is post-resurrection, where Jesus appears to His disciples who are gathered in a locked room out of fear. The repetition underscores the significance of His message and His desire to reassure and instruct His followers. This setting highlights the transition from fear to mission, as Jesus prepares His disciples for their future roles.<p><b>Peace be with you</b><br>"Peace" (Shalom in Hebrew) is a traditional Jewish greeting, but here it carries deeper meaning. After His resurrection, Jesus offers peace as a gift of reconciliation and assurance. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but a profound sense of well-being and wholeness that comes from being in right relationship with God. It echoes Jesus' earlier promise in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, where He assures His disciples of peace despite the coming trials.<p><b>As the Father has sent Me</b><br>This phrase establishes the divine authority and purpose behind Jesus' mission. The Father sending the Son is a central theme in the Gospel of John, highlighting the unity and shared mission within the Trinity. Jesus' mission was characterized by obedience, love, and sacrifice, setting a pattern for the disciples. This sending reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being sent to save and serve (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p><b>so also I am sending you</b><br>Here, Jesus commissions His disciples, extending His mission to them. This sending is not just a task but a continuation of Jesus' work on earth. The disciples are to carry forward the message of the Gospel, empowered by the Holy Spirit, as seen in the subsequent verses. This commission is foundational for the Church's mission, linking to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.

His reappearance underscores that His resurrection body is real, not an illusion, just as He had foretold (<a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36-40</a>).

He is now about to withdraw the evidence of His presence from them, and does so with the customary "<span class= "ital">Shal?m;</span>" but with this He reminds them of the apostleship to which He has called them, gives them an earnest of the Presence which will never leave them, but always qualify them for it (<a href="/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), and places before them the greatness of the work to which He sends them (<a href="/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As my </span>(better, <span class= "ital">the</span>) <span class= "bld">Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span>--Comp.

He and they stand also in the same relation to the world. At this very moment they are assembled with shut doors, for fear of the Jews, who are triumphing over Him as dead. But to that world, which will hate, persecute, and kill them, as it had hated, persecuted, and killed Him, they are sent as He was sent; they are to declare forgiveness, mercy, love, peace, as He had declared them, to every heart that does not harden itself against them; and they are to find in His presence, as He had ever found in the Father's presence, the support which will ever bring peace to their own hearts (<a href="/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Peace, spiration of the Holy Spirit, and conference of power to remit or retain sin. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore [Jesus</span><span class="cmt_word">] said unto them again, Peace be unto you.</span> With added emphasis, and in obvious reference to his valedictory discourse, he gave to them the essence of his own sublime repose, the blending of an infinite joy with a measureless sorrow; the equilibrium that springs from the spirit mastering the flesh. Not an ecstatic rapture, nor a joy that would make their life on earth insupportable by its contrast with their abiding frame of mind; but peace - "the peace of God, which passeth understanding." The first "peace" gave to all who were assembled a new revelation; the second "peace," a summons to service. The Lord added the memorable words, <span class="cmt_word">As the Father hath sent me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, hath sent me on a special commission), <span class="cmt_word">I also send you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>, charge you to go forth and accomplish this commission of mine); see Westcott's excursus on the New Testament usage of the two verbs, which does much to justify these shades of meaning. Both verbs are used of both the mission of the Son and the mission of believers, but in the two senses, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that sometimes the special service on which he or they are sent is emphasized by the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that at other times the simple mission or sending forth is the dominant idea when <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is employed. Thus in <a href="/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a> the Lord says, "I sent (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor;" and <a href="/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a> (see note) the same word is appropriately used twice - for the Lord's own commission, and also for the commission of the disciples. Then it seems to point back to an event in their history and the work done already and before Christ's death for the world. Now the disciples have a new conception of Christ and of his work, and they must go forth to fulfill it. This usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is more or less conspicuous in <a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>; <a href="/john/3-28.htm">John 3:28</a>; <a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>; <a href="/john/18-24.htm">John 18:24</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used often to describe the Father's mission of the Son, the mission of the Comforter, and the mission of the disciples (<a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>; <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>). Moulton says, " <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> means 'commission' and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;</span> 'mission.' With the first word our thoughts turn to the 'special embassy;' with the second, to the authority of the ' ambassador' and the obedience of the sent." Another peculiarity of this passage is that the Lord uses the perfect tense, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than the aorist used elsewhere, suggesting a complete commission on his own side, whose meaning and effects are still in operation. Those who have received this revelation are to become at once witnesses to the fact of his resurrection, agents and organs of his Spirit. Moulton suggests that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in order to enforce the physical separation between the Lord and his disciples; and that we cannot overlook in the similarity of the ideas the difference in the manner of the sending, by the Savior of the disciples, from the manner in which the Son had been sent by the Father. Christ came forth from the eternal companionship of the Father, in the fact of his incarnation, taking humanity up into his eternal substance. The disciples were sent forth by the risen Lord, who had called them by grace into fellowship with himself, and who equipped them for his service.
