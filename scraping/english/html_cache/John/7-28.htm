The temple was the center of Jewish religious life, and teaching there indicated authority and a public platform. Jesus crying out suggests urgency and the importance of His message. This public declaration in such a sacred space underscores His role as a teacher and prophet, challenging the religious leaders and the people.<p><b>You know Me, and you know where I am from</b><br>This statement addresses the common knowledge among the people about Jesus' earthly origins, specifically Nazareth in Galilee. However, it also hints at a deeper misunderstanding of His true divine origin. The people knew His family and background, but many failed to recognize His messianic identity. This reflects the tension between Jesus' human and divine nature, a theme throughout the Gospels.<p><b>I have not come of My own accord</b><br>Jesus emphasizes His divine mission and submission to the Father's will. This phrase highlights the concept of Jesus as the sent one, a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. It underscores His obedience and the divine plan of salvation. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as being sent by God.<p><b>but He who sent Me is true</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to God the Father, affirming His reliability and faithfulness. The truth of God contrasts with the misunderstanding and unbelief of the people. This statement also connects to <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where Jesus is described as full of grace and truth, embodying the Father's character.<p><b>You do not know Him</b><br>This is a direct challenge to the religious leaders and the people, highlighting their spiritual blindness and lack of true relationship with God. Despite their religious practices and knowledge of the Scriptures, they failed to recognize God's work through Jesus.

(Comp. in this Gospel <a href="/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>; <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>; <a href="/john/12-44.htm" title="Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.">John 12:44</a>.) Here this feeling has been roused by another instance of their misapprehension, because they think of the outward appearance only, and therefore do not grasp the inner truth. They know whence He is; they had been taught that no man should know the Messiah's origin, and therefore they think He is not the Christ. And this technical reason, the meaning of which they have never fathomed, is enough to stifle every growing conviction, and to annul the force of all His words and all His works! St. John is impressed with the fact that it was in the very Temple itself, in the presence of the priests and rulers, in the act of public teaching, that He uttered these words, and he again notices this, though he has told us so before (<a href="/john/7-14.htm" title="Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.">John 7:14</a>; <a href="/john/7-26.htm" title="But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?">John 7:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am.</span>--He takes up their objection in order to refute it. There is, indeed, a sense in which it is true. Those features were well known alike to friend and foe. With minds glowing with the fire of love or of hate, they had gazed upon Him as He walked or taught, and His form had fixed itself on the memory. They knew about His earthly home and early life (<a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>), but all this was far short of the real knowledge of Him. It is but little that the events of the outer life tell of the true life and being even of a brother man. Little does a man know even his bosom friend; how infinitely far were they, with minds which did not even approach the true method of knowledge, from knowing Him whom no mind can fully comprehend! . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore cried</span> - lifted up his voice in such a way as to cause wide astonishment. (The word is found in <a href="/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a> of John the Baptist, and ver. 37 and <a href="/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44</a>; but frequently in the synoptists and Acts, and very frequently in the LXX.) The trumpet peal sounded through the courts of the temple, and the crowds rushed in the direction from which it proceeded. He cried <span class="cmt_word">in the temple</span>. This clause is added, notwithstanding the statement of ver. 14, and it intimates a break in the discourse, a sudden and trenchant response to certain loudly uttered murmurs of the Jerusalem multitude. <span class="cmt_word">Ye both know me, and know whence I am.</span> Surely (with De Wette, Meyer, Westcott, Moulton) the Lord distinctly concedes to the men of Jerusalem a certain amount of superficial knowledge. It is lamentably defective in respect of that for which they imagine it all-sufficient; and yet this knowledge was highly significant and important as far as it went. Such knowledge of his birthplace and his family, his provincial training, his Galilaean ministry, were all proofs to them of his <span class="accented">humanity</span> - that he belonged to their race, was bone of their bone, and sympathizing in their deepest sorrows, understood their noblest aspirations. Such a concession, moreover, repudiates the supposed docetic character of the Christ of the Fourth Gospel. Many commentators regard the exclamation its ironical and interrogatory (Grotius, Lampe, Calvin, Lucke, and even Godet), without sufficient warrant. Our Lord, however, soon shows that, though they are rightly informed about certain obvious facts, there were others of stupendous importance which could go a long way towards rcconciling their many-sided and conflicting ideas of Messiah, of which they were yet in ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">And yet</span> (all commentators show that there is a certain adversative force about this third <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>; see also ver. 30; <a href="/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>; <a href="/john/9-30.htm">John 9:30</a>; <a href="/mark/12-12.htm">Mark 12:12</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I am not come from myself (</span>see <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>). I have not risen upon the wings of my own ambition. It is not my mere human whim and purpose, or my desire for self-glorification, which brings me before you. You may know the home of my childhood; and watched as I have been by your eager spies, as you had full right to do, you may know all my public proceedings, and yet you have not fathomed the fact that I have not come on my own errand, nor does my humanity as you have grasped it cover the whole of the facts about me. There is a peculiarity, a uniqueness, about my coming that you have yet to learn. I have been <span class="accented">sent</span> to you; <span class="cmt_word">but he that sent me is real</span> - a reality to me, which makes it an absolute reality in itself. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is somewhat peculiar, and, unless with some commentators and Revisers we make it equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, and thus disturb the uniform usage of St. John, we must either imagine under the word a real "Sender," or one really answering to the idea already announced as of <span class="accented">One</span> competent to send. "He that sent me, the Father," of whom I spoke (<a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>) when last we conversed together, is the overwhelming Reality in this case. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye know not.</span> The Jerusalem multitudes were suffering grievously from the superstitious limitations of their own faith, from the traditions, the symbolism, the letter, the form, which had well nigh strangled, suffocated, the underlying truths. They had in many ways lost the God whose great Name they honoured. They failed to apprehend his awful nearness to them, his love to every man, his compassion to the world, the demand of his righteousness, the condition of seeing him, the way to his rest - "<span class="accented">Him ye know not."</span> This was a serious rebuke of the entire system which prevailed at Jerusalem. Not understanding nor knowing the <span class="accented">Father</span>, they were unable to see the possibility of his having sent to them, through the life and lips of a Man whom they knew, his last and greatest message. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
