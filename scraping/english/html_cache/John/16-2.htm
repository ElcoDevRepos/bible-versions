The synagogue was not only a place of worship but also a central hub for community life, so being cast out meant social and religious ostracism. This expulsion is documented in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>, where the parents of the man born blind feared being put out of the synagogue. Historically, this reflects the growing tension between Jewish authorities and the early Christian movement, which was seen as a heretical sect within Judaism.<p><b>In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.</b><br>This prophecy by Jesus foreshadows the persecution that His followers would face, particularly from those who believed they were upholding religious purity. The Apostle Paul, before his conversion, exemplifies this mindset as he persecuted Christians, believing he was serving God (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3, 9</a>:1-2). This reflects a broader historical context where religious zeal often led to violence against perceived heretics. The phrase also echoes the Old Testament, where misguided zeal for God led to acts of violence, such as in <a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6-13</a> with Phinehas.
