The glorification of Jesus is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where Jesus' works and words reveal His divine nature and mission. The Holy Spirit continues this work by pointing believers to Christ, emphasizing His teachings, and enabling them to understand His significance. This aligns with <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>, where the Spirit testifies about Jesus, and <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1</a>, where Jesus prays for His glorification through the completion of His work on earth.<p><b>by taking from what is Mine</b><br>This indicates the intimate relationship between Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit does not act independently but draws from the authority, wisdom, and truth of Jesus. This reflects the unity within the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit work harmoniously. The phrase underscores the divine origin of the Spirit's revelation, ensuring that it is consistent with Jesus' teachings and mission. This is reminiscent of <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, where the Spirit is described as the Helper who will teach and remind the disciples of everything Jesus has said.<p><b>and disclosing it to you</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role is to reveal and make known the truths of Jesus to the believers. This disclosure is not just intellectual but transformative, enabling believers to live out the teachings of Christ. The Spirit's revelation is ongoing, providing guidance, comfort, and understanding to the followers of Jesus. This aligns with the promise in <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>, where the Spirit of truth dwells with and in the believers, ensuring they are never alone in their spiritual journey. The Spirit's work is essential for the growth and maturity of the Christian faith, as seen in the early church's reliance on the Spirit for direction and empowerment in Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as "He" in this verse, the Holy Spirit's role is to glorify Jesus by revealing His truth to the disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are the recipients of the Holy Spirit's revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room_discourse.htm">The Upper Room Discourse</a></b><br>The context of this passage, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit's primary role is to glorify Jesus.

The Spirit therefore completes the Trinitarian pattern: the Father glorifies the Son (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4-5</a>), the Spirit glorifies the Son, and redeemed people, in turn, glorify God through the Son (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by taking from what is Mine</b><p>&#8226; Everything that belongs to Jesus&#8212;truth, authority, life, victory&#8212;belongs equally to the Spirit (<a href="/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).

(Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1John 4:1-2</a>.) The revelation of Christ is not an imperfect revelation which the Holy Spirit is to supplement. It is a full revelation imperfectly received, and His office is to illumine the heart, and bring home to it the things of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall glorify me</span>. Christ has spoken of being straightway glorified, lifted into the fullness of the Godhead, glorified in God himself (<a href="/john/13-32.htm">John 13:32</a>). This statement is partly explanatory of that, but is also an addition to the previous assurance. The Spirit will glorify the God-Man, will augment the luster of his blessed Name, will crown him with honor, and multiply the mirrors of his majesty and the subjects of his power; and the reason is given: <span class="cmt_word">For he shall take of mine, and</span> (for the second time, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">declare it to you</span>. Christ is here profoundly conscious of the abundance of truth and reality involved in himself and in his functions, in the work he is doing and will continue to do. He is mournfully alive to the fact that the disciples were not able to perceive what there was in him without supernatural aid. The Spirit of God will augment Christ's glory in the Church, seeing that he will reveal to men the Person and glory of the Christ, by inward processes, by vivid spiritual intuitions, by mental exercises which we are quite ready to confess are far beyond the compass of logic, and break through all laws of induction or evolution. This is the high function of the Spirit in inspiration - to take of that which belongs to the Son of God, and so to quicken the spiritual faculty of men that they can and do understand it. "The Spirit searcheth all things, even the depths of Deity," and reveals them to those who receive the Holy Ghost. Our Lord declares that all truth is implicitly contained in himself. In <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. he said, "I am the Truth" about God and about man, and about the relation of man to God. The Spirit will draw aside the veils which hide this truth, will draw forth the hidden harmonies contained in this wondrous Personality. Such continuous revelation is from glory to glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17, 18</a>). St. Paul at the close of his ministry was aware of unfathomed treasures still hidden in the Christ, and he put before himself, as the goal of his highest ambition, "that I may know him" (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekeinos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1565.htm">Strong's 1565: </a> </span><span class="str2">That, that one there, yonder.
