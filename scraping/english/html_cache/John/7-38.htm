Belief in Jesus is central to Christian faith, and this statement underscores the necessity of personal faith in Him. The context of this passage is during the Feast of Tabernacles, a time when water ceremonies were significant, symbolizing God's provision. Belief in Jesus is not just intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Him as the Messiah. This invitation is open to all, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries, aligning with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>as the Scripture has said</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jesus is referencing the Hebrew Scriptures, though no specific verse is directly quoted. It suggests a synthesis of Old Testament themes, such as the life-giving water in <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where water symbolizes the Spirit and blessing. The use of "Scripture" affirms the authority and continuity of the Old Testament in revealing God's plan, fulfilled in Christ. It also highlights Jesus' role as the fulfillment of prophetic expectation.<p><b>&#8216;Streams of living water will flow from within him.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This imagery of "streams of living water" is rich with biblical symbolism. In the ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, essential for life, and often used metaphorically for spiritual sustenance and the Holy Spirit. The phrase "living water" recalls Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, where He offers water that leads to eternal life. The promise of water flowing "from within him" suggests the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, which believers receive, as further explained in <a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>. This internal transformation results in outward expressions of life and blessing, echoing the transformative power of the Spirit prophesied in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, during which water was a crucial element for survival.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believers.htm">The Believers</a></b><br>Those who place their faith in Jesus, as referenced in this verse, are promised the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Although not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the "streams of living water" symbolize the Holy Spirit, as clarified in the following verse (<a href="/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scriptures.htm">The Scriptures</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophecies and writings that foreshadow the coming of the Messiah and the outpouring of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_foundation.htm">Faith as the Foundation</a></b><br>Belief in Jesus is the prerequisite for receiving the living water, emphasizing the importance of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_indwelling_spirit.htm">The Indwelling Spirit</a></b><br>The living water represents the Holy Spirit, who dwells within believers, providing spiritual nourishment and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_flow.htm">Continuous Flow</a></b><br>The imagery of streams suggests an ongoing, abundant supply of spiritual life and vitality available to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/scriptural_fulfillment.htm">Scriptural Fulfillment</a></b><br>Jesus' promise of living water fulfills Old Testament prophecies, demonstrating the continuity and reliability of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_and_overflow.htm">Witness and Overflow</a></b><br>As believers are filled with the Spirit, they are called to overflow with love, grace, and truth to those around them.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_flow_daily_with_life.htm">How can believers ensure "rivers of living water" flow from within them daily?

Some would attach the first clause to the preceding verse, reading, "If any man thirst, let him come unto Me; and let him that believeth on Me drink." Others would have us think that the words, "as the Scripture hath said," belong to the clause before them, and not to that which follows, making the sense, "He that believeth on Me according to the Scriptures, out of his belly (I say) shall flow rivers of living water." The reader of the English will, it is believed, feel, and the reader of the Greek will feel still more strongly, that these are attempts to avoid what it is hard to explain, and that while they miss the difficulty they also miss the meaning.<p><span class= "bld">He that believeth on me . . .</span>--We have here an advance on the thought, "If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink." That represented the satisfaction of the individual mind. This teaches the fuller truth that every one in living communion with Christ becomes himself the centre of spiritual influence. There is in him a power of life which, when quickened by faith, flows forth as a river, carrying life and refreshment to others. No spirit grasps a great truth which satisfies its own yearnings as the waters of the fountain slake physical thirst, without longing to send it forth to others who are seeking what he himself had sought. There is in him a river whose waters no barrier can confine. This is the spirit of the prophet and the evangelist, of the martyr and the missionary. It is the spirit of every great teacher. It is the link which binds men together and makes the life of every Christian approach the life of Christ, for he lives not for himself but for the world.<p>The exact words "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water," are not found in any part of the Canonical Scriptures of the Old Testament, and yet Christ Himself utters them with the formula of quotation. This will be a difficulty only to those who value letter and syllable above spirit and substance. It may be that the words which our Lord actually uttered in the current language of Jerusalem were nearer to the very words of some passage in the Old Testament than they seem to be in the Greek form in which St. John has preserved them to us. But it is instructive that the thought is that which our Lord Himself, or St. John as representing Him, considers as the essence of the quotation. The thought meets us again and again in the Old Testament. See the following passages: <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm" title="Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm" title="And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.">Numbers 20:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/114-8.htm" title="Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.">Psalm 114:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and make fat your bones: and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="/joel/2-23.htm" title="Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.">Ezekiel 47:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/47-12.htm" title="And by the river on the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.">Ezekiel 47:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm" title="And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.">Zechariah 14:8</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth on me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the nominative absolute, followed by another construction, gives great force to the mighty words. This is not the first time that Christ has represented believing under the form of both "coming" and "drinking." The one term seems to cover that part of faith in Christ which unites the soul to him, which sides with him, which utterly abandons self to take his word as true and his power as sufficient; the other term, when applied to participation in his blood, implies receiving into the soul the full solace of his imparted life. <span class="accented">He that believeth on me, <span class="cmt_word"></span>as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall rush torrents of living water.</span> From his newly given, divinely imparted life shall proceed, as from the innermost depths of his consciousness, illimitable supplies of refreshment and fertility for others as well. Each soul will be a rock smitten in the thirsty land, from which crystal rivers of life-giving grace shall flow. Godet urges, against Meyer, the great sufficiency of this particular illustration of the rock in the wilderness as justifying the reference to the phrase, "as the Scripture hath said," and points especially to <a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, "Behold, I will stand before thee there... in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and out of it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) water shall come, that the people may drink" (cf. <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/114-8.htm">Psalm 114:8</a>; passages read during the feast). He thinks the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;</span> corresponds with "from out of it" of Exodus. Hengstenberg laid long and fantastic emphasis on the <span class="accented">Canticles</span>,where the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the bride of Jehovah is described. It is certain that the numerous passages in the Old Testament, in which the gift of refreshing water is made the symbol of national mercies and spiritual blessings, do, for the most part, fall short of this remarkable expression. Still, <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>, all more or less approach the thought; but <a href="/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where from the altar the living, health giving, mighty river flows for the healing of the nations, is so akin to the saying of the Lord, as soon as we recognize the fact that he is greater than the temple, and that his Church is God's temple, and each body of man a temple of the Holy Ghost, that all real difficulty vanishes. The whole history of the Church is one continuous comment and illustration of the exhaustless fulness of his Word. Just as a soul of man comes and drinks of the water of life, he becomes himself a perennial source of life to others. He supplies not cisterns of stagnant water, but rivers of living water (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). Chrysostom adds, "One may perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom of Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of Paul; how nothing withstood them - not the anger of multitudes, nor the uprising of tyrants, nor plots of devils, nor daily deaths - but, as rivers borne along with loud rushing sound, they went on their way." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
