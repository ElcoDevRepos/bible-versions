In the context of the New Testament, this was a radical idea, as salvation was often thought to be limited to the Jewish people. This inclusivity is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which states that there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus. The use of "everyone" underscores the breaking down of barriers and the opening of God's promise to all humanity.<p><b>who believes</b><br>Belief is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where it is often synonymous with faith and trust in Jesus Christ. The Greek word used here, "pisteu&#333;," implies a deep, personal trust and reliance, not just intellectual assent. This concept is foundational to Christian doctrine, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith it is impossible to please God. The emphasis on belief highlights the personal response required to receive the gift of salvation.<p><b>in Him</b><br>"In Him" refers specifically to Jesus Christ, the central figure of the Christian faith. This phrase underscores the necessity of faith being directed towards Jesus, as He is the object of belief. <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a> reinforces this by stating that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father except through Him. The exclusivity of Christ as the means of salvation is a key tenet of Christian theology.<p><b>may have eternal life</b><br>"Eternal life" is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, representing not just an unending existence but a quality of life that begins now and continues forever in the presence of God. This concept is rooted in the Jewish understanding of life in the age to come, but Jesus expands it to include a present reality. <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a> defines eternal life as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. The promise of eternal life is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and is central to the hope offered in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about the necessity of being born again to see the kingdom of God.

The lifting up of Jesus on the cross is not an end in itself but a means. God&#8217;s intent is clear and loving:<p>&#8226;He provides a singular solution for the sin problem (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>).<p>&#8226;The cross is the hinge on which eternal destiny turns (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>).<p>Everything that follows in <a href="/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a> flows from this divine purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everyone</b><p>The scope is breathtakingly inclusive: &#8220;everyone.&#8221; No ethnicity, status, or past sin is disqualifying. Scripture keeps driving home this open invitation:<p>&#8226;&#8220;But to all who received Him&#8230;He gave the right to become children of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226;&#8220;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek&#8230;&#8216;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12-13</a>).<p>The door is wide enough for the whole world&#8212;yet narrow in that it requires the response spelled out next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who believes</b><p>Belief is not mere mental assent; it is trusting reliance. Jesus emphasizes it repeatedly:<p>&#8226;&#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-47.htm">John 6:47</a>).<p>&#8226;The Philippian jailer heard, &#8220;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>).<p>Faith is the hand that receives the gift; works and merit never enter the equation (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Him</b><p>The object of faith matters. Eternal life is not found in a philosophy or a set of rules but &#8220;in Him&#8221;&#8212;the lifted-up Son of Man. Jesus claimed exclusivity: &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). John later wrote, &#8220;God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11-12</a>). Salvation is personal because it centers on a Person.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May have</b><p>The phrase signals both certainty and present possession. Those who believe do not merely hope to receive life later; they &#8220;have&#8221; it now. Jesus assured, &#8220;Whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life&#8230;he has crossed over from death to life&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226;Eternal life is a settled gift, not a probation.<p>&#8226;It rests on the finished work of Christ, not on ongoing human performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eternal life</b><p>The gift is &#8220;eternal,&#8221; describing both length and quality. Jesus defined it: &#8220;Now this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Its duration is endless (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226;Its essence is relationship&#8212;knowing God through Christ.<p>&#8226;Its beginning is immediate upon faith and its fullness stretches into forever, free from death, sin, and sorrow (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a> assures us that God&#8217;s purpose in lifting up His Son was so that absolutely anyone&#8212;no matter who&#8212;who places trusting faith in Jesus now possesses the unending, God-filled life He offers. The verse is a concise promise: inclusive in invitation, exclusive in means, certain in outcome, and immeasurable in blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Not perish, but . . .</span>--These words have been added here from the following verse. Omitting them, the sentence should be rendered, <span class= "ital">that every one who believeth may have in Him eternal life.</span> This construction is borne out by a comparison of <a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>; <a href="/john/16-33.htm" title="These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.">John 16:33</a>; <a href="/john/20-31.htm" title="But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.">John 20:31</a>. "To believe in Him" is not used by St. John. (See Note on <a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>.) The thought of this verse is that as every Israelite, believing in God, had in the brazen serpent a message from God; so every man who believes in God ever has this message from God in the crucified Son of Man. The object of faith is not here expressed. The words speak only of the man who believeth, whose heart is open to spiritual truth. That man has, in Jesus Christ and Him crucified, a truth which goes to his inmost spirit, sending a new life through his whole being. To the non-believer this may be but the self-sacrifice of heroism. To the believer it is Light breaking upon the darkness of his soul; it is Life bursting the cold sepulchre of a deadened spirit; it is Love winning its way through the scales of a hardened heart; it is Mercy deeper and wider even than his sin; it is Hope bracing the man to a new life of holiness; it is the Word of <span class= "ital">God,</span> and in Him he has eternal life. The reader will not forget that the lifting up the serpent of brass followed the confession of the people. "We have sinned . . . pray unto the Lord that He take away the serpents from us" (<a href="/numbers/21-7.htm" title="Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.">Numbers 21:7</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
