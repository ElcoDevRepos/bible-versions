The coming of Jesus fulfilled numerous Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold the Messiah's arrival. His teachings and miracles provided clear evidence of His divine authority and identity. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, rabbis and teachers were highly respected, and Jesus' role as a teacher was central to His ministry. His words were not just informative but transformative, challenging the religious leaders and the people to reconsider their understanding of God and His kingdom.<p><b>they would not be guilty of sin</b><br>This statement underscores the increased accountability that comes with greater revelation. In biblical theology, sin is often understood as missing the mark of God's holiness and commands. Before Jesus' ministry, the people had the Law and the Prophets, but His coming brought a fuller revelation of God's will. <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> explains that the Law makes people aware of sin, but Jesus' teachings brought a deeper understanding of righteousness and the nature of sin. The historical context of this passage involves the Jewish leaders' rejection of Jesus despite the clear evidence of His messianic identity, which heightened their culpability.<p><b>Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the removal of any justification for unbelief or disobedience. Jesus' life and words were a direct confrontation to the religious status quo, leaving the leaders and the people without a defense for their rejection of Him. In <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, Paul writes about how God's invisible qualities are evident in creation, leaving humanity without excuse. Similarly, Jesus' presence and message made God's truth unmistakable. Theologically, this highlights the concept of revelation and accountability; with greater light comes greater responsibility. The rejection of Jesus, despite His clear revelation, is seen as a willful act of disobedience, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of human rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, explaining the implications of His ministry and teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being prepared for the challenges they will face after His departure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Implicitly referenced as those who have heard Jesus' words and seen His works, yet still reject Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents those who are in opposition to Jesus and His message, often characterized by unbelief and sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_jesus'_ministry.htm">The Event of Jesus' Ministry</a></b><br>The period during which Jesus taught, performed miracles, and revealed the truth about God, culminating in His crucifixion and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_for_revelation.htm">Accountability for Revelation</a></b><br>Jesus' coming and His words bring a higher level of accountability.

It would have been the negative evil of men who know not.

The word "cloke" as used with sin is familiar to us from the exhortation in the Book of Common Prayer. The idea is rather to cover up, to hide as with a garment, so that they may not be seen; whereas here the idea is of excuse for manifest sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I had not come,</span> as the incarnate Word of God, if I had not fulfilled the promises and come forth from God into the world to reveal the Father, <span class="cmt_word">and spoken to them</span>, made known to them the thought and Spirit of God, made it possible for them to know the essence of the only true God, <span class="cmt_word">they had had</span> <span class="cmt_word">no sin</span>; they would not have resisted the highest love, their alienation in this respect would not have been a violation of the most solemn and gracious demands of the Father. The greatest sin is the refusal of the most complete revelation, and by the side of this all other sin becomes comparatively trivial. Our Lord could not have spoken of the hatred of himself or his disciples (so Lucke and Meyer) as this sin, because it would have been obviously impossible to hate a non-existent revelation or revealer. It is the deeper fall which is consequent upon a deliberate rejection of the highest love. Formerly, they would have been in the condition of those whose sins of ignorance God overlooks (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>), and to whose <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the past God has exercised <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in anticipation of the coming grace. <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (Luke in numerous places uses this expression to form a strong contrast) <span class="cmt_word">they have no excuse</span> or pretext <span class="cmt_word">for their sin</span>, or concerning their sin.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and is not "cloak or covering," but "<span class="accented">palliation</span> or excuse" for manifest sin. So long as men have seen no deeper into the nature of God than they can go with the aid of mere phenomena or ratiocination on the details of creation, their fears and even their hatreds formulated into grim legend, or uncouth idols, or repellent hypothesis, are a natural outcome of a nature so corrupt; but they ought to have found in Christ a deeper revelation, a summons to service and adoring love. In rejecting the idea of God which I have set before them they have no excuse. St. Paul (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>) declares that those who have defamed the great characteristic of God which may be learned from nature are without excuse. Certainly our Lord does not say this here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
