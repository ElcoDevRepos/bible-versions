In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, Jesus had just performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000, which drew attention to physical needs. However, He redirects the focus from temporary satisfaction to spiritual nourishment. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>, where the prophet questions why people spend money on what is not bread and labor on what does not satisfy. The cultural context of first-century Judea, where daily survival often depended on securing food, highlights the radical nature of Jesus' teaching to prioritize spiritual over physical needs.<p><b>but for food that endures to eternal life</b><br>Here, Jesus introduces the concept of spiritual sustenance that leads to eternal life. This "food" is a metaphor for the teachings and salvation He offers. It aligns with the Jewish understanding of wisdom and the Word of God as life-giving, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, where it is stated that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. The eternal life mentioned is a central theme in John's Gospel, pointing to a quality of life that begins now and continues forever in God's presence.<p><b>which the Son of Man will give you</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is significant, as it connects Jesus to the prophetic vision in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. This title emphasizes both Jesus' humanity and His divine authority. The promise that He will "give" this food underscores the grace and generosity of Christ, offering salvation and eternal life as a gift, not something earned by human effort.<p><b>For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine authentication of Jesus' mission and identity. In ancient times, a seal was a mark of ownership and authority, often used to secure documents or goods. God's seal on Jesus signifies His approval and endorsement, affirming Jesus as the legitimate source of eternal life. This is reminiscent of the baptism of Jesus, where the voice from heaven declares Him as the beloved Son (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The seal also implies the presence of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, where believers are sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Son of Man)</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, emphasizing His role as the provider of eternal sustenance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who has placed His seal of approval on Jesus, affirming His authority and mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience Jesus addresses, who are seeking Him after the feeding of the 5,000.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where this discourse takes place, following the miraculous feeding event.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feeding_of_the_5,000.htm">The Feeding of the 5,000</a></b><br>A preceding event that sets the context for this teaching, highlighting the contrast between physical and spiritual nourishment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_eternal_nourishment.htm">Seek Eternal Nourishment</a></b><br>Focus on spiritual growth and sustenance that leads to eternal life, rather than temporary, worldly gains.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognize_jesus'_authority.htm">Recognize Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>Understand that Jesus is divinely appointed and approved by God to provide eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritize_spiritual_over_physical.htm">Prioritize Spiritual Over Physical</a></b><br>While physical needs are important, prioritize spiritual needs and trust God to provide.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/live_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Live with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Make decisions and live life with eternity in mind, valuing what has lasting significance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_jesus'_provision.htm">Trust in Jesus' Provision</a></b><br>Have faith that Jesus will provide what is necessary for eternal life, as He is the source of true sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_6_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 6:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_lasting_food_daily.htm">How can we prioritize "food that endures" in our daily lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_6_27_Eternal_vs_temporary_focus.htm">What does John 6:27 teach about seeking eternal over temporary satisfaction?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_6_27_Matt_6_19-21_on_wealth.htm">How does John 6:27 connect with Matthew 6:19-21 on storing treasures?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_eternal_life_food.htm">In what ways can we work for "the food that endures to eternal life"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Jesus_as_sealed_by_God.htm">How does Jesus being "sealed by God" impact our trust in His promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_food_that_endures_in_John_6_27.htm">What does John 6:27 mean by "food that endures to eternal life"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_6_27_vs_materialism_consumerism.htm">How does John 6:27 challenge materialism and consumerism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_Son_of_Man_in_John_6_27.htm">Why does Jesus emphasize the "Son of Man" in John 6:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_god_the_father.htm">What defines God the Father?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_being_a_muslim.htm">What defines being a Muslim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_pro-palestinian_movement.htm">Who knows the Son except the Father?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/should_non-workers_be_allowed_to_eat.htm">Should those who refuse to work be allowed to eat?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 6:27 Mean</div><b>Do not work for food that perishes</b><p>&#8220;Do not work for food that perishes&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>a)<p>&#8226; Jesus has just fed the five thousand (<a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1-13</a>).

When daily bread becomes the chief pursuit, hearts drift from the Bread of Life.<p>&#8226; Practical check-up: if the bulk of time, thought, and emotion revolves around what moths can eat and rust can corrode, priorities need realignment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But for food that endures to eternal life</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but for food that endures to eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>b)<p>&#8226; The contrast is sharp: labor for nourishment that never spoils. Jesus used similar imagery with the Samaritan woman: &#8220;Whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Eternal food is the life of God Himself, received now and enjoyed forever. Isaiah&#8217;s invitation still rings: &#8220;Why spend money on that which is not bread, and your labor on that which does not satisfy?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeking this food shows up in choices:<p>&#8211; Setting aside moments to feast on Scripture (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Gathering with believers (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p>&#8211; Investing resources in Kingdom work (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike perishable bread, this sustenance deepens with use; every act of obedience enlarges spiritual appetite and capacity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which the Son of Man will give you</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;which the Son of Man will give you&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>c)<p>&#8226; The nourishment is not earned wages but a gift from &#8220;the Son of Man,&#8221; Jesus&#8217; favorite self-designation (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation is &#8220;by grace&#8230; through faith&#8230; not by works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).

By shifting effort from the merely temporary to the eternally substantial, believers find nourishment that satisfies today and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Labour not for the meat which perisheth.</span>--This is one of the instances in which the reader of the English Bible has in the margin a much better rendering than in the text. <span class= "ital">Work not</span> shows the verbal connection with <a href="/context/john/6-28.htm" title="Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?">John 6:28-30</a>, which is wholly lost in "labour not." It will be instructive to compare the other passages in this Gospel where the word occurs: <a href="/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a> (<span class= "ital">wrought</span> in God); <a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>. <span class= "ital">Work not</span> is better than "work not for," by which the words have been sometimes rendered The sense is, "Work not out--let it not be the result of your constant working--to have food (comp. <a href="/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>) which perisheth; but let your work be one worthy of your endeavour, food which endureth unto eternal life, which food the Son of Man will give to you."<p><span class= "bld">For him hath God the Father sealed.</span>--The emphasis of the original is seen better by preserving the order of the words, <span class= "ital">for Him hath the Father sealed, even God.</span> (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Labour</span> (work, toil, rush, as you are doing, from Bethsaida Julias to Capernaum, or from either to Jerusalem) <span class="cmt_word">not for the food that is perishable,</span> which soon loses its effect and must be renewed, which is corruptible and worthless if not partaken of at once, which, like manna, may breed worms, or vanish in the sun; labour not for the merely outward and vanishing and perishable elements in my work. Christ did not mean that these multitudes were not to toil for their daily bread, which could only be secured for them by labour and the sweat of the brow; <span class="cmt_word">but to labour for the food which endureth</span> (or, <span class="accented">abideth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto eternal life</span> (this last clause Moulton would separate from the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, and considers to relate to the principal verb of the sentence; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "labour for the abiding food," <span class="accented">with a view to, or unto, eternal life</span>). The bread that abideth unto eternal life, however, corresponds very closely with the water of life (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), which, when once appropriated, flows and springs up with perennial energy within the soul, conferring the consciousness and the beginning of eternal life. There is a food which is imperishable and incorruptible, feeding the heavenly life within the soul, and which, if once assimilated, becomes Divine life itself. Labour for that life <span class="cmt_word">which the Son of man will give to you</span>. This grand idea, viz. the gift of eternal life in and by Christ himself, was one of the main themes of the Gospel of John. Christ knew himself to be the Giver of eternal life - a life of perfect blessedness, irrespective of time, and sense, and flesh, and the world, and death. The Lord here calls himself "Son of man," rather than "Son of God." The whole of the subsequent discourse expands and rests upon this gift of the perfect and blessed life in and by his <span class="accented">humanity</span>. In the previous chapter attention was called to the Divine Sonship and the Divine activity. Here equal emphasis was laid upon the <span class="accented">human</span> sonship and on the acceptance and assimilation by man of this supreme gift. The power or function of the Son of man to bestow this life is sustained by the assertion, <span class="cmt_word">For him</span> (this very one) <span class="cmt_word">the Father, even God, hath sealed.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (see <a href="/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>)means here to ratify and accredit as worthy and competent to discharge such duties, to render indubitable, to confirm by outward visible sign. or seal, as one empowered to do so Divine a thing. The Father has made "the Son of man" the steward of his bounty. The Son of man has the key to this boundless treasure, this eternal blessing. Men, however, must labour to receive so great a gift. It will prove to be a gift, even if they put forth the most strenuous energy to receive it. This first dialogue contrasts the carnal and spiritual reasons for seeking Jesus, and brings into sharp relief the Galilaean conception of the Christ, as Miracle worker, temporal Potentate, prophetic Leader of some vast host of triumphant enthusiasts, and contrasts with it the Lord's own conception. of himself as the Giver, the Medium, the divinely appointed Almoner of a spiritual blessing, for which, while the Father-God freely and lavishly gives it, the sons of men must eagerly toil. The next question and answer bring out the moral condition on which alone the gift can be dispensed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
