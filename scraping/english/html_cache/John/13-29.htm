This role is significant as it highlights the irony of Judas's eventual betrayal. The money bag, or "money box," was used to hold funds for the group's expenses and charitable acts. This detail underscores the practical needs of Jesus and His disciples during their ministry. The mention of Judas keeping the money bag also foreshadows his later actions, as his love for money ultimately leads to his betrayal of Jesus (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>).<p><b>some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast</b><br>The disciples' assumption reflects the customary preparations for the Passover feast, a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12). This context emphasizes the importance of the Passover in Jewish life and its fulfillment in Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The disciples' misunderstanding also highlights their lack of awareness of Judas's impending betrayal and the deeper spiritual significance of the events unfolding.<p><b>or to give something to the poor</b><br>Giving to the poor was a common practice in Jewish culture, especially during festivals like Passover, when almsgiving was encouraged. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for the needy, as seen throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>) and reinforced by Jesus' teachings (<a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2-4</a>). The mention of giving to the poor aligns with Jesus' ministry focus on compassion and justice. It also contrasts with Judas's actions, as his concern for money ultimately overrides any genuine desire to help others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus.

Their confidence in him underscores the shock of his coming betrayal (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Today, the phrase challenges us about stewardship and integrity: money is a tool for ministry (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34&#8211;35</a>), but the love of money remains a snare (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast</b><p>&#8226; The disciples are sharing the Passover meal (<a href="/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12</a>; <a href="/luke/22-7.htm">Luke 22:7&#8211;13</a>).

He often sent them on errands (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8&#8211;13</a>), so this sounded routine.<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; limited understanding in the moment echoes <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>: &#8220;At first His disciples did not understand these things.&#8221; Clarity would come later, after the resurrection and the Spirit&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, it&#8217;s a reminder that the Lord&#8217;s plans can be unfolding right before our eyes while we interpret events only at the surface level (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or to give something to the poor.</b><p>&#8226; Giving to the poor was a normal part of Jesus&#8217; ministry rhythm (<a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2&#8211;4</a>). The disciples naturally thought another act of charity was in view.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a> quietly testifies to that reputation: if Jesus suggested a nighttime errand, the disciples instantly assumed benevolence. Compare <a href="/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a>, where Judas frames almsgiving as a reason to sell Mary&#8217;s perfume.<p>&#8226; Old Testament law encouraged generosity during feast times (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; 26:12&#8211;13). Jesus perfectly embodied that heart of compassion (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Our takeaway: authentic discipleship still involves tangible care for the needy (<a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a> shows how ordinary explanations masked an extraordinary betrayal. Judas, trusted as treasurer, slipped out under cover of what sounded like a simple supply run or a charitable errand. The verse highlights Jesus&#8217; patient sovereignty, the disciples&#8217; limited perception, and the ministry&#8217;s consistent compassion for the poor. It calls us to faithful stewardship, spiritual alertness, and generous care for those in need while trusting that the Lord&#8217;s purposes will prevail even when we can&#8217;t yet see the full picture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Because Judas had the bag.</span>--Comp.
