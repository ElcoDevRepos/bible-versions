In the biblical context, the Spirit is often associated with creation and renewal (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>). The Holy Spirit is the agent of regeneration, as seen in <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5-6</a>, where Jesus speaks of being "born of the Spirit." This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people, giving them a new heart and spirit. The life given by the Spirit is eternal, contrasting with the temporal nature of physical life.<p><b>the flesh profits nothing.</b><br>Here, "the flesh" refers to human effort and natural abilities apart from divine influence. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, reliance on the flesh could mean adherence to the law or traditions without understanding their spiritual significance. Paul echoes this sentiment in <a href="/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>, stating that those who are in the flesh cannot please God. This phrase underscores the futility of trying to achieve spiritual life through human means, highlighting the necessity of divine intervention.<p><b>The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.</b><br>Jesus' words are not merely informative but transformative, carrying the power of the Spirit. In the historical context, Jesus' teachings often challenged the prevailing religious norms, offering a deeper, spiritual understanding of God's kingdom. His words fulfill the prophecy of <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise a prophet who will speak His words. The connection to other scripture is evident in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, which describes the word of God as living and active. Jesus, as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodies the life-giving power of God's message, offering eternal life to those who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples and followers, explaining the spiritual nature of His teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, struggling to understand the spiritual implications of His words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered this discourse, following the feeding of the 5,000 and walking on water.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Many followers who were initially drawn to Jesus because of His miracles and teachings but struggled with His deeper spiritual messages.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the divine source of life and understanding beyond the physical realm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_life-giving_spirit.htm">The Life-Giving Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is the source of true life, transcending physical existence.

If it is retained here, it must, however, be noted that it is a compound of the word rendered "life" at the close of the verse. "It is the spirit that giveth life . . . the words . . . are spirit and are life." These words are immediately connected with the thought of the Ascension, which was to precede the gift of the Spirit. (Comp. <a href="/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>; <a href="/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> We are to find in them, therefore, a deeper meaning than the ordinary one that His teaching is to be, not carnally, but spiritually under-stood. They think of a physical eating of His flesh, and this offends them; but what if they, who have thought of bread descending from heaven, see His body ascending into heaven? They will know then that He cannot have meant this. And the Descent of the Spirit will follow the Ascension of the Son, and men full of the Holy Spirit will have brought to their remembrance all these words (<a href="/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>), and they will then know what the true feeding on Him is, and these very words which He has spoken will carry their lessons to the inmost being, and be realised, not simply in a spiritual sense, but as spirit and as life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is the spirit that quickeneth</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span>, though omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;</span>, is retained by all the principal editors); <span class="cmt_word">the flesh profiteth nothing;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the "flesh" taken by itself, and apart from the life-giving Spirit which is its principium. The antithesis between "flesh" and "spirit" occurs frequently in the Gospel, and is one of the great points of Pauline doctrine. The Lord does not introduce the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. The statement is generalized, though having special reference to himself, or to the spirit and flesh of the Son of man. "Flesh," in neither St. Paul nor St. John, means the sensuous nature as opposed to the intellectual nature; nor does it mean the "body" as antithetic to the "soul" - the organized material frame, to which the Jews were attributing so much and felt to be the guarantee and seal of his spiritual efficiency (Meyer) - but the "creaturely nature," the "humanity" <span class="accented">per se</span> in all its parts. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Christ <span class="accented">qua</span> his humanity was fashioned by the Spirit, and the Spirit dwelt upon him with iron measurable potence. "The Logos became flesh," but that flesh itself was so ordered and prepared by the Holy Spirit as that it should sustain this lofty companionship. Christ's own flesh, his nature, his humanity <span class="accented">per se</span>, and apart from the fulness of the Spirit, profiteth nothing. The mere human life, however spotless and ideal, could not be "eaten," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. could not be assimilated, though to some extent it might be imitated; but imitation is not faith. The "glory" that the apostles saw "of the Only Begotten of the Father, the fulness of grace and truth," in and through that wondrous life of Christ, was the glory given to his humanity by the creative Spirit. Apart from this consideration, a manducation of his flesh, even were it physically possible, was useless. It was not possible to participate in his humanity save through the Holy Spirit which generated him and regenerates us. The sentence doubtless points back to the original constitution of man, the specialty of whose life is that it was inbreathed by the Lord God himself. The use of the saying here was to make it still more clear that he gave his flesh to eat, not through any physical process, not through any sacramental rite, but through the Spirit to our spirit. Mr. Sadler, who takes the strong sacramental view of the entire passage, says, however, wisely and forcibly here, "Even flesh cannot be given to a corpse." We receive the gift, we know the love of God, whether sacramentally or not, through the Spirit. Christ does not deny or retract the statement, "Except ye eat the flesh," etc. He simply shows in what sense he meant the <span class="accented">whole mutual indwelling of himself and his people to be understood</span>. The Spirit is the Quickener. The Spirit is the life-fashioning, life-pre-serving Energy. The flesh, the human manifestation, apart from the Spirit which makes that human life the centre of Divine effluence, the focus for its Divine energy, profiteth nothing. Some have taken these words (like Chrysostom) as a contrast between a spiritual and literal interpretation of Christ's words. Luther and many Lutherans have urged the contrast between a right celebration and a merely material use of the sacrament. So more or less Augustine and Olshausen. Canon Westcott seems to limit the original meaning of "flesh" and "spirit," the one to the visible, temporal, corporeal only, and the other to the unseen eternal order of things, and he does not give to "flesh" here the fulness of meaning which it bears in the New Testament; but he says that this utterance is not limited to either of the views just referred to, though it may include them. Archdeacon Watkins remarks, "They think of a physical eating of his flesh, and this offends them; but what if they, who have thought of bread descending from heaven, see his body ascending into heaven?
