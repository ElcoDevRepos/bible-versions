Simon Peter is often seen as a leader among the disciples, which is why she might have sought him out first. The "other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved," is traditionally understood to be John, the author of this Gospel. This phrase highlights the special relationship between Jesus and John, which is a recurring theme in this Gospel. The urgency in Mary's actions reflects the shock and confusion of the moment, as well as the importance of the event.<p><b>&#8220;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,&#8221; she said,</b><br>Mary's statement reflects her initial misunderstanding of the resurrection. At this point, she assumes that Jesus' body has been moved or stolen, a common concern in ancient times when tombs were sometimes robbed. This misunderstanding sets the stage for the revelation of the resurrection. The use of "the Lord" signifies her recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity, even in her confusion. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of misunderstanding and revelation that runs throughout the Gospel of John.<p><b>&#8220;and we do not know where they have put Him!&#8221;</b><br>The use of "we" suggests that Mary was not alone in her visit to the tomb, aligning with other Gospel accounts that mention multiple women visiting the tomb. This collective uncertainty emphasizes the shared experience of the disciples and followers of Jesus during this pivotal moment. The phrase underscores the human element of the resurrection narrative, highlighting the disciples' initial lack of understanding and the gradual unfolding of the truth. This moment of confusion is contrasted with the later clarity and joy of the resurrection appearances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus who was the first to discover the empty tomb.

We know not what other burying-place "they" have chosen! The anti-harmonistic commentators, with ponderous literalism, insist that Mary could have said nothing more. A gushing woman like Mary of Magdala uttered one sentence, and that was all: It is, however, entirely evident that she must have said enough to excite great wonderment, haste, and activity in the breasts of these two disciples (see above on the three hypotheses). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
