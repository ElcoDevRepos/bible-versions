This event is recorded in <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19-28</a>, where priests and Levites from Jerusalem question John. The act of sending emissaries indicates the authority and concern of the religious leaders regarding John's growing influence and the potential implications for their own power. It reflects the Jewish practice of seeking validation from recognized religious figures. John the Baptist's role as a forerunner to Christ is prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where he is described as a voice preparing the way for the Lord.<p><b>and he has testified to the truth</b><br>John the Baptist's testimony is centered on the identity and mission of Jesus Christ. In <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-34</a>, John declares Jesus as the "Lamb of God" and the "Son of God," affirming His divine nature and redemptive purpose. John's testimony aligns with the truth of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. The concept of truth in John's Gospel is significant, as it is often associated with the revelation of God's character and purposes through Jesus (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). John's role as a witness to the truth underscores the importance of credible testimony in establishing Jesus' identity and mission, fulfilling the requirement of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> for multiple witnesses to confirm a matter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his role in preparing the way for the Messiah.

Better, therefore, <span class= "ital">Ye have sent; He hath borne witness.</span> The pronoun "ye" is emphatically opposed to the "I" of the following verse. They sought human witness.

The sending to John was probably a reference to the official transaction described in <a href="/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>. This is not the "other" whom he referred to, for in the next clause he made solemn disclaimer of resting his claim upon John or upon any individual man. The witness of the forerunner was a true one. The function of the prophet is to bear witness to the Light, to strip off the veils which hide it, to call attention to its most solemn realities, to quicken vision, to stimulate conscience, to disturb apathy, to discern the coming and prepare the way of the Lord (see <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5</a>, notes), He was not the Light; but he did call attention to a testimony immeasurably more precious than any word proceeding merely from human lips. The testimonies of John, both before and after he came into contact with Christ, were very wonderful and were adapted to exert and did produce a deep impression upon the people for a time; but by themselves they would not have given sufficient ratification to the Lord's words. We may welcome still all Johannine, ministerial testamonies to the Lord. but the power of God himself must assert itself to the inner consciousness bet, re any man receives the gospel. No mere human testimony to such claims as these rises to the dignity of the occasion. Unless the Father's witness can be discerned, supreme, convincing, and final, John's witness would be insufficient. It may arrest attention, it may impress the apathetic, it may overawe the gainsayers; but it is not final, nor does it leave the hearers without excuse. All the rhetoric, all the threatening, all the irony, of Elijah would have failed if the fire of the Lord had not fallen to consume the sacrifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
