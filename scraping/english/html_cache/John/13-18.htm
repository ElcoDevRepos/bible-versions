He makes a distinction, indicating that His forthcoming statement does not apply to every one of them. This highlights the presence of a betrayer among the group, setting the stage for the revelation of Judas Iscariot's betrayal. The context is crucial as it occurs during a private and intimate moment, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.<p><b>I know whom I have chosen.</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His divine knowledge and authority in choosing His disciples. This choice is not merely about selection for ministry but also encompasses the foreknowledge of their actions and destinies. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of divine election, where God&#8217;s choices are purposeful and sovereign. It also reassures the faithful disciples of their secure place in His plan.<p><b>But this is to fulfill the Scripture:</b><br>Jesus often referenced Old Testament prophecies to demonstrate that His life and mission were in accordance with God&#8217;s predetermined plan. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of prophecy, a common theme in the Gospels, which serves to authenticate Jesus' messianic identity and the divine orchestration of events.<p><b>&#8216;The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.&#8217;</b><br>This is a direct reference to <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where David laments betrayal by a close friend. In the cultural context, sharing bread was a sign of fellowship and trust, making the act of betrayal even more poignant. The phrase "lifted up his heel" suggests an act of treachery and hostility. By applying this scripture to Judas, Jesus identifies Himself with the suffering servant motif and foreshadows His impending betrayal, linking His experience to the broader narrative of redemptive history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples during the Last Supper.

There is one who, though he knows these things, will not do them, is now indisposed to see any Divineness in the act and spirit of love which I am laying down as a fundamental law of my kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> <span class="cmt_word">whom</span> (or, <span class="accented">the individuals whom</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I chose</span> for apostles - (in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. the same statement is made with less definiteness, "Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you," etc.?) Judas among them - but. It is difficult to follow this construction, and to decide on the antithesis to this disjunctive. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> We may add, <span class="accented">this has happened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> this choice has been overruled, and so in its issues corresponded with the Divine purpose (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">- so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He that eateth my bread</span> or, <span class="accented">bread with me, hath lifted his heel against me</span>; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> we may take the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> as a parenthesis, and link the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> with the quotation, "He that eateth," etc.; or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> we may, with Meyer, suppose that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, "I chose them," is mentally involved here: "I chose them, and Judas among them (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="accented">in order that the Scripture</span>," etc. This connection would suggest a destiny and purpose which Christ knowingly corresponded with, harmonizing his plan with the Divine and prophetic program. Emphasis must be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It refers to Christ's choice of apostles, not to the eternal election to salvation. This interpretation corresponds more closely with the text, though it savors of a fatalism foreign to the Scripture. There is, however, a true sense in which the evil-disposed man is so placed that, if he will sin, he must sin along certain well-defined lines. The forty-first psalm, from which the quotation is made, is not strictly Messianic; it is descriptive of the ideal Sufferer, the holy but outraged man, whose melancholy condition is sure to be characterized by treachery among his familiar friends. Christ implies that, if he were to fulfill this portraiture, then this bitter dreg would be put into his cup; and so he humanly made this choice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps which in their tenderness of love might have saved Judas from the worst, but which were really part of a Divine plan which would vindicate his own foresight and the method of Divine government. A full understanding of the formula in Matthew and John, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span>, will save us from putting into these words a hopeless fatalism. Notice that the LXX. reads this passage differently, and is not so closely allied to the Hebrew: "He that eateth my leaves hath magnified against me his surreptitious despite, his tricky antagonism." Great beauty is given to the passage by the R.T. <span class="accented">you</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, for it suggests the idea that Christ was the real Host of the twelve, the Father and Provider of his family. Christ must be regarded as the Father and Host of the entire group of guests, and the treacherous treatment of a host throughout the East is regarded as a sign of peculiar obduracy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I am not speaking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pant&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
