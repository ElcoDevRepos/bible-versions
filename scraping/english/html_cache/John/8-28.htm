In the Gospel of John, Jesus often uses direct speech to reveal deep spiritual truths and to clarify His identity and mission. This setting is part of a larger discourse where Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and the people in the temple courts.<p><b>&#8220;When you have lifted up the Son of Man,</b><br>The term "lifted up" is a reference to Jesus' crucifixion. In the cultural and historical context, crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, symbolizing shame and suffering. However, Jesus uses it to signify His glorification and the fulfillment of His mission. The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, indicating both His humanity and divine authority. This phrase foreshadows the crucifixion as a pivotal event for revealing Jesus' true identity.<p><b>then you will know that I am He,</b><br>This statement points to the recognition of Jesus' divine identity post-crucifixion. The phrase "I am He" echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, suggesting Jesus' unity with God. The crucifixion and subsequent resurrection serve as the ultimate revelation of Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and confirming His teachings.<p><b>and that I do nothing on My own,</b><br>Here, Jesus emphasizes His complete dependence on and unity with the Father. This reflects the consistent theme in John's Gospel of Jesus' submission to the Father's will. It highlights the Trinitarian relationship and the divine mission of Jesus, who acts not independently but in perfect harmony with God's plan.<p><b>but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of Jesus' teachings. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, a rabbi or teacher would often speak on their own authority or tradition. However, Jesus claims His teachings come directly from God the Father, affirming His role as the ultimate prophet and teacher. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise a prophet who will speak His words. Jesus' teachings are thus presented as the ultimate revelation of God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central

8:28 Mean</div><b>So Jesus said</b><p>Jesus has been teaching in the temple courts (<a href="/john/8-20.htm">John 8:20</a>), confronting religious leaders who doubt His origin and authority. He has already warned, &#8220;For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>). Now, still addressing the same crowd, He draws their attention forward to a moment that will settle the question of who He is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When you have lifted up the Son of Man</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lifted up&#8221; looks first to the cross. Just as Moses lifted the bronze serpent so the Israelites might look and live (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>), Jesus will be physically lifted on the cross, bearing sin (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also anticipates His resurrection and exaltation (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-33</a>). What seems like defeat will prove to be the very means by which salvation is accomplished and Christ is glorified.<p>&#8226; By calling Himself &#8220;the Son of Man,&#8221; Jesus ties this event to the Messianic figure of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, the One given everlasting dominion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that I am He</b><p>&#8226; At the cross and empty tomb, the identity of Jesus becomes undeniable. The centurion confesses, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>). The resurrection leaves the apostles declaring, &#8220;God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;I am He&#8221; echoes the divine name (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>) and reinforces earlier claims (<a href="/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>, <a href="/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>). The revelation comes not through philosophical debate but through the historical fact of His crucifixion and resurrection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I do nothing on My own</b><p>&#8226; Repeatedly Jesus affirms His perfect submission: &#8220;The Son can do nothing by Himself&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>) and &#8220;I do not seek My own will&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This underscores His sinlessness (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) and His role as the obedient Servant (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Every miracle, teaching, and decision lines up with the Father&#8217;s plan, proving that the cross is no accident but divine design (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I speak exactly what the Father has taught Me</b><p>&#8226; Jesus fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a> as the Prophet who relays God&#8217;s words without error. &#8220;For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>).<p>&#8226; His message is therefore binding; to reject His words is to reject the Father (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48-50</a>).<p>&#8226; The unity of Father and Son means that at Calvary, God Himself is acting and speaking, offering reconciliation to the world (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a> points straight to the cross.

Not only is he "the Son," and "the Son of God," but indubitably he is also "the Son of man." He has come down from heaven and is before them as a Man among men - "one Jesus." He has taken upon himself the form of a slave, the fashion of man. That the manifestation of the Divine should be perfectly realized in the human, though a fundamental truth lying at the heart of all revelation, is nevertheless <span class="accented">not</span> the alphabet of Divine teaching; nay, it is the very highest and most recondite of all truths. This humbled humanity of the incarnate Logos led on to other issues of enormous significance. The eternal Son in the form of God would become, as "Son of man," obedient unto death. The highest revelation of the Son of God, and therefore of the Father, would be effected by the surrender of that mysterious life of his for the world's behoof. The previous announcements of this truth, which we now see to be the very crown and culmination of the gospel, had greatly offended his hearers of all kinds, and on distinct grounds. In the words that follow a touch of deeper meaning than any which had preceded is supplied when he proceeds to associate this death of the Son of man with the wilful act of the ecclesiastical authorities in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said</span> (<span class="accented">unto them</span>), <span class="cmt_word">When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man</span> (compare here notes on John 3:14; 6:62; 12:32). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is used with the twofold sense of exaltation on the cross" signifying by what death he should glorify God" - and also of the issues of that lifting up by means of the tree of ignoble torment and mortal agony to the throne of glory. The twofold meaning of the word cannot be excluded here. <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come to</span> <span class="cmt_word">know</span> - then the process of proof will be completed - <span class="cmt_word">that I am</span> (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) - that I am that which fundamentally I am declaring to you, that my testimonies have unique but trenchant confirmation - <span class="cmt_word">and that I am doing nothing from myself, but that even as the Father taught me,</span> (so) <span class="cmt_word">these things I speak.</span> The "he that sent me" (ver. 26), is here replaced by "the Father." "The things which I heard from (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) him" is replaced by "even as the Father taught me," and the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> are repeated. "The cross and the crown" will be the proof to the most obtuse and bigoted "<span class="accented">that I am</span> that which I say I am."
