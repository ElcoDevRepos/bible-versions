In the context of the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending death, resurrection, and ascension. This foretelling is consistent with the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, where prophets often announced events before they occurred (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>). Jesus' ability to predict future events underscores His divine nature and authority, aligning with His identity as the Son of God.<p><b>so that when it does happen</b><br>Jesus emphasizes the purpose of His prophecy: to strengthen the faith of His disciples. The events He refers to include His crucifixion and resurrection, which were difficult for the disciples to comprehend at the time. By predicting these events, Jesus provides a foundation for their faith, ensuring that when these events unfold, the disciples will recognize them as fulfillment of His words. This is similar to how Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled in the New Testament, serving as a testament to God's sovereign plan.<p><b>you will believe</b><br>The ultimate goal of Jesus' foretelling is to foster belief. This belief is not just intellectual assent but a deep, trusting faith in Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God. The disciples' belief would be crucial for the establishment of the early Church and the spread of the Gospel. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of faith in the Gospel of John, where belief in Jesus is central to receiving eternal life (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>). Jesus' predictions and their fulfillment serve as a catalyst for the disciples' faith, enabling them to witness boldly to others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, preparing them for His impending death, resurrection, and ascension.

By stating matters plainly, the Lord models transparency; nothing catches Him off guard, underscoring His divine foreknowledge (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before It Happens</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;before it happens&#8230;&#8221;

(<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;The Son of Man will be delivered&#8230;they will kill Him, and after three days He will rise&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophecy validates divine authorship; only God can declare &#8220;the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By announcing events beforehand, Jesus shows He is Lord over time, not merely reacting to history but orchestrating it (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So That When It Does Happen</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;so that when it does happen&#8230;&#8221;

(<a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, at Pentecost, Peter confidently proclaims fulfilled prophecy (<a href="/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus repeats the pattern: &#8220;I have told you these things so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I told you&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-4.htm">John 16:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment turns past words into present proof, transforming confusion into conviction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You Will Believe</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;you will believe.&#8221;

faith. By telling them in advance, He linked prophecy to fulfillment, turning bewilderment into belief. Each fulfilled word proves His sovereignty and invites us to trust every promise He has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">And now I have told you before it come to pass.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/13-19.htm" title="Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.">John 13:19</a>. Here, again, He tells them the event before the accomplishment, that it may serve to strengthen their faith. Two interpretations of this verse are possible. (1) That He told them of the coming of the Advocate to teach all truth, and bring all things to their remembrance, in order that in the fulfilment of this they may, with increase of faith, believe in Him. (2) That He told them of His going to the Father, in order that when the hour of departure came they may believe that He had gone to the Father. Upon the whole, and especially considering the close parallel with <a href="/john/13-19.htm" title="Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.">John 13:19</a>, the first seems the more probable meaning.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now I have said it to you before it come to pass</span> - I have told you of my departure and what is involved in it - <span class="cmt_word">that when it is come to pass, ye may believe</span>. Christ often appeals to the effect which the fulfillment of his own predictions will produce in the minds of his disciples (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>). They will, when the series of events will unroll themselves, believe that he has gone to the Father, to do all he said he would do, to be all he said he was. This means undoubtedly more than a spiritual consolation whereby they may endure his separation by <span class="accented">death</span> from their society. It is the announcement beforehand of the Resurrection and Ascension, by which their faith in his exaltation would be fanned into burning flame and made a revelation of Divine love to the universe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(nyn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3568.htm">Strong's 3568: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of present time; 'now'; also as noun or adjective present or immediate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7988;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(eir&#275;ka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2046.htm">Strong's 2046: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably a fuller form of rheo; an alternate for epo in certain tenses; to utter, i.e. Speak or say.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
