This was the second time they summoned him, indicating their persistence and determination to discredit Jesus. The repeated questioning reflects the legalistic nature of the Pharisees and their adherence to the oral traditions and laws. The man who had been blind represents those who have received spiritual sight and understanding through Christ, contrasting with the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Give glory to God!</b><br>This phrase is a call for the man to speak the truth, akin to taking an oath. It echoes <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, where Joshua tells Achan to confess his sin. The Pharisees are urging the man to attribute the miracle to God, but not to Jesus, whom they refuse to acknowledge as the Messiah. This reflects the tension between acknowledging God's work and rejecting the one through whom God works, a common theme in the Gospels.<p><b>We know that this man is a sinner.&#8221;</b><br>The Pharisees assert their belief that Jesus is a sinner because He healed on the Sabbath, violating their interpretation of the law. This accusation highlights the conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities, who prioritized legalistic adherence over compassion and mercy. The statement also underscores the irony of their spiritual blindness, as they fail to recognize Jesus as the sinless Son of God.

In contrast, the man&#8217;s forthcoming testimony will truly glorify God by pointing to the sinless Savior whose power opened blind eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Then again called they the man that was blind.</span>--He had not been present during the interview with his parents.

It is not "Give God the praise for your cure, instead of this Man, who is a sinner. Trace the gift to its true source, and give glory to the true Giver." This is wholly opposed to the context, for they are assuming that no cure has really taken place. The phrase is rather an adjuration calling upon the man to speak, as in God's presence, and confess the whole truth. (Comp. the words of Joshua to Achan, "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me," <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a>. Comp. also <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm" title="Why you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.">1Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm" title="Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.">Jeremiah 13:16</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_esdras/9-8.htm" title="And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,">1 Esdras 9:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm" title="And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.">Revelation 16:9</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they</span> ("the Jews") <span class="cmt_word">called a second time the man that was</span> (had been) <span class="cmt_word">blind, and said unto him</span>; no longer asking for any details of the process of the cure, they sought with ingenuity to blunt the edge of the powerful testimony which this man had borne to the prophetic rank and even Messianic claims of Jesus, by inducing him to recant. <span class="cmt_word">Give glory to God</span>, said they. Many have urged (see Calvin, De Wette, Lange, Lucke, and Meyer) that this is only a solemn form of adjuration, which corresponds with <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a>; 3Esdras 9:8, and was a hypocritical appeal to the man to eat his own words on oath; and Godet urges, "They demanded that this guilty assertion, 'He is a Prophet,' should be blotted out by the contrary one,' He is a sinner.'" Moulton says, "A formula used when a criminal who was thought to be concealing the truth was being urged to make a full confession." Luthardt, Lampe, and others rightly observe that this adjuration theory, though it suits <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>, does not fit <a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>, and that the Pharisees rather wished the man to give glory direct to God, and not to Jesus. They implied that their action was dictated by zeal for the honor of God, and tempted the man to disclaim the mediation of Divine grace through the lips and at the will of Jesus. They add, <span class="cmt_word">We know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) absolutely, on theologic grounds beyond the comprehension of the poor man, and we can sustain it with all the weight of our tradition and custom - we <span class="accented">know</span> that this <span class="cmt_word">Man is a sinner.</span> They give no reference, and do not condescend to particulars.
