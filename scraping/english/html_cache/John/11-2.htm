This Mary is often associated with Mary of Bethany, distinct from other Marys in the New Testament. The mention of Lazarus being sick sets the stage for the miracle of his resurrection, which is a pivotal event in the Gospel of John. The family lived in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which was a place Jesus frequently visited. This connection highlights the close relationship between Jesus and this family, emphasizing the personal nature of the miracle to come.<p><b>was to anoint the Lord with perfume</b><br>This phrase foreshadows an event described in <a href="/john/12.htm">John 12:1-8</a>, where Mary anoints Jesus with expensive perfume. This act of anointing is significant as it symbolizes honor and devotion, and in the context of Jesus, it prefigures His burial. Anointing with perfume was a customary practice in Jewish culture for guests and for preparing bodies for burial, indicating both reverence and prophetic insight into Jesus' impending death.<p><b>and wipe His feet with her hair</b><br>Mary's act of wiping Jesus' feet with her hair is an expression of humility and devotion. In the cultural context of the time, a woman's hair was considered her glory, and using it to wipe Jesus' feet demonstrates profound humility and love. This act also signifies the breaking of social norms, as women typically did not let their hair down in public. It reflects Mary's deep personal commitment to Jesus and serves as a model of worship and service.<br><br>Each phrase in this verse connects to broader themes in the Gospel of John, such as the revelation of Jesus' identity, the foreshadowing of His death and resurrection, and the intimate relationships He formed with His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, known for her act of worship and humility in anointing Jesus with perfume.

Still, the other Evangelists had not told the name, and St. John, when the name first occurs in his narrative, connects it with the person whose deed of love was known to all.<p>There is no sufficient reason for identifying Mary of Bethany with the "woman which was a sinner" (see Notes on <a href="/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or for identifying either with Mary Magdalene. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used of any aromatic balsam which is distilled from trees and herbs by itself.

No trace of such distinction is found in the New Testament (cf. <a href="/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a> with <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>). One great distinction in biblical Greek is that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used of religious anointings, from its association with <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. is only twice used in this sense, while <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used times without number (Archbishop Trench, 'New Test. Syn.,' &sect; 38.). The use of the term <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lord," shows that the story was widely known, and that when the Gospel was written it had passed into a commonplace of Christian experience and illustration. The anointing has not yet been referred to by John, but he is looking back upon the events and anticipates his own subsequent record. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Mary,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#8048;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Mariam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3137.htm">Strong's 3137: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Mariam of Hebrew origin; Maria or Mariam, the name of six Christian females.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whose</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7975;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">brother</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
