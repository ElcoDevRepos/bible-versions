In the context of the Gospel of John, this authority is a central theme, emphasizing Jesus' divine role and mission. The concept of judgment is rooted in Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is given dominion and authority. This authority to judge is not merely a future event but is active in Jesus' earthly ministry, as seen in His teachings and miracles. The authority to execute judgment also underscores Jesus' role as the ultimate arbiter of justice, aligning with passages like <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where Jesus describes the final judgment.<p><b>because He is the Son of Man</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is significant, appearing frequently in the Gospels and rooted in Jewish apocalyptic literature, particularly in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>. It conveys both Jesus' humanity and His divine authority. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, this title would resonate with messianic expectations, yet Jesus redefines it through His life, death, and resurrection. The use of "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' identification with humanity, fulfilling the role of the perfect mediator between God and man. It also connects to the theme of Jesus as the second Adam, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45-49</a>, highlighting His role in restoring what was lost through the fall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Son of Man," Jesus is the central figure in this passage, emphasizing His divine authority and role in judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who grants Jesus the authority to execute judgment, highlighting the divine relationship and mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the audience in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, questioning Jesus' authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus performs miracles and teaches, leading to confrontations with religious leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_judgment.htm">The Event of Judgment</a></b><br>The future event where Jesus will execute judgment, as granted by the Father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus' authority is divinely given and encompasses both spiritual and earthly realms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_son_of_man.htm">Role of the Son of Man</a></b><br>Understand the significance of the title "Son of Man" as it relates to Jesus' mission and identity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_justice.htm">Judgment and Justice</a></b><br>Reflect on the certainty of divine judgment and the importance of living a life aligned with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/relationship_with_the_father.htm">Relationship with the Father</a></b><br>Acknowledge the unity and purpose shared between Jesus and the Father in the plan of salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Use the knowledge of Jesus' role as judge to motivate personal repentance and faith in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_27_Jesus_authority_to_judge.htm">How does John 5:27 affirm Jesus' authority to judge as the Son of Man?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Responsibilities_from_Jesus_as_judge.htm">What responsibilities arise from recognizing Jesus' role as judge in John 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Daniel_7_13-14_to_John_5_27_authority.htm">How does Daniel 7:13-14 connect to Jesus' authority in John 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_should_believers_live_under_Jesus_judgment.htm">How should believers live knowing Jesus has "authority to execute judgment"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_5_27_Confidence_in_Jesus_judgment.htm">How can John 5:27 inspire confidence in Jesus' righteous judgment today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_authority_to_execute_judgment.htm">What does John 5:27 mean by "authority to execute judgment"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_5_27_s_link_to_Jesus_divinity.htm">How does John 5:27 relate to Jesus' divinity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Son_of_Man_in_John_5_27.htm">Why is the title "Son of Man" significant in John 5:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_actions_do_angels_perform.htm">Is Jesus the ultimate judge of humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_jesus_humanity's_final_judge.htm">Is Jesus the ultimate judge of humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/are_you_in_heaven_or_hell.htm">Are you in Heaven or Hell?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_faces_judgment_(john_5_22_vs._rom_8_1).htm">Who will be judged?

The explanation is, once more, to be found in the thought of the Incarnation as an emptying Himself of the attributes which are the glories of the divine nature. It is not because He is Messiah (<span class= "ital">the</span> Son of Man), but human (<span class= "ital">a</span> son of man), that the Father gave Him the power to have life in Himself, and the authority to execute judgment. (See Note on <a href="/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>.) Still His humanity is not <span class= "ital">here</span> dwelt upon as a qualification for the office of judge, because it is of the same nature as that of those He judges. This thought and the thoughts which flow from it (comp. <a href="/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>) are full of beauty and truth, but the side of truth prominent in this verse, and all those which follow <a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>, is not His relation to man, <span class= "ital">but His</span> relation to God.

He now adds, so far as the relation to man is concerned, his fitness and authority to administer justice, to preside over the entire juridical process, to lift the scales, to determine the destiny of the human race. The fitness is seen in this, that he, "the Son," is "the Son of man." The one term, "THE SON," entirely covers the twofold Sonship. The proof of his humanity is assumed to be complete. The fact of it is the ground that he who knows what is in man should be the Judge of men. By personal experience of man's temptations and frailties; by knowing every palliation of our sins, every extenuation of our failures, every aggravation of our weakness; by gazing through human eyes with human consciousness upon our mysterious destiny, he is competent to judge; whereas by being Son of God as well as Son of man, he is entrusted with power to execute the judgment of the Eternal. The principle involved is based upon perfect justice. The honour thus conferred on the God-Man is infinite, the consolation thus held out to man unspeakable. We are being judged by Christ, not by impersonal law. The entire incidence upon every individual of the Law is in the hands of the Redeemer. The Saviour, the Life-giver, the Voice which quickens the dead, assigns the judgment. We must be careful, in any inference we draw from this grand utterance, to avoid all suspicion of schism or rivalry between the Father and the Son. The Son is not more merciful than the Father. For the Father of the Old Testament pitieth his children, and knoweth their frame (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13, 14</a>), and the Father of Jesus Christ loves the world, and counts the very hairs of our heads. The Son will not exercise this judgment with less regard to the claims of eternal justice than the Father; but his knowledge of humanity is, by the nature of the case, a guarantee of such application of the justice of God to the case of every individual, that man's knowledge of himself will be able personally to justify and verify it. The Divine judgment will go forth from the heart of man himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He has given</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ed&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
