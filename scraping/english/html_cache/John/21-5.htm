After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples multiple times, often unexpectedly. This setting is by the Sea of Galilee, a familiar place for the disciples, many of whom were fishermen. Jesus calling out to them from the shore mirrors His earlier interactions with them, such as when He first called them to be "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). This calling out signifies His continued guidance and leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Children, do you have any fish?&#8221;</b><br>The term "children" is a term of endearment and authority, reflecting Jesus' relationship with His disciples. It suggests care and a familial bond, emphasizing His role as a teacher and shepherd. The question about having fish is practical, yet it also sets the stage for a miraculous event, reminiscent of previous miracles like the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>). This question also highlights the disciples' return to their old profession, possibly indicating a lack of direction without Jesus' physical presence.<p><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>The disciples' response of "No" underscores their inability to succeed without Jesus' guidance, despite their expertise as fishermen. This moment of failure is crucial, as it prepares them for the miracle that follows, demonstrating their dependence on Jesus. It also reflects the broader theme of human insufficiency and the need for divine intervention, a recurring theme throughout the Gospels. This acknowledgment of lack sets the stage for Jesus to reveal His power and provision once again.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.

The verse invites believers to hear His voice, confess our insufficiency, and trust His gracious provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Children, have ye any meat?</span>--The word rendered "Children" (or, as the margin has it, <span class= "ital">Sirs</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> is used in addressing others only by St. John among the New Testament writers (<a href="/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning.

You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>, where we have an expression denoting His affectionate tenderness for the disciples, which would not have been appropriate here, for He does not at once reveal His identity to them. It is a word which, indeed, may express His love for them (comp. <a href="/john/4-49.htm" title="The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.">John 4:49</a>), but which appears also to have been used as an address to workmen or inferiors, not unlike our own words "boys" or "lads." They seem to take it in this sense, as though some traveller passing by asked the question because he wished to purchase some of their fish.<p>The word rendered "meat" occurs here only in the New Testament. It means anything eaten with bread, and was used as equivalent to the fish which was the ordinary relish. (Comp.

The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> suggests a negative answer. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is that which is eaten with bread, and is commonly <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, something roasted for the purpose of eating with bread. Since fish was very frequently used for the purpose, the word was often used for "fish" itself (LXX., <a href="/numbers/11-22.htm">Numbers 11:22</a>; <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.9, 11. Other equivalent words are found in Attic Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Children</span> (lads, young men yonder), <span class="cmt_word">you have nothing, I suppose, to eat?

Their listless manner showed that they had toiled in vain, and, perhaps with tone or gesture of unwillingness to confess their failure, they replied in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">Then he said</span> <span class="cmt_word">to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship</span>; the side opposite to that on which they were dragging it along.

The difficulty arose <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (or, <span class="accented">because of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the multitude of the fishes</span>. The miracle here is a simple indication of the higher knowledge which the Lord possessed. This huge shoal may, humanly speaking, have been perceived in its approach; so that the event is more impressive in its analogical force than in its supernatural machinery. It suggests the surprising results that would accompany their labor when they should under the Lord's own injunction and inspiration, become veritable fishers of men. The parabolic teaching of this miracle is unusually obvious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
