John had a significant following, and his disciples were devoted to his teachings. The act of coming to John suggests a need for clarification or reassurance, highlighting the human tendency to seek guidance from spiritual leaders. This reflects the role of discipleship in the Jewish tradition, where students would closely follow a rabbi to learn and understand spiritual truths.<p><b>&#8220;Look, Rabbi,</b><br>The use of "Rabbi" shows respect and acknowledgment of John the Baptist's authority as a teacher. In Jewish culture, a rabbi was a respected teacher and leader, often with a group of disciples. This title underscores John's role as a spiritual guide and the respect his followers had for him. It also sets the stage for the contrast between John and Jesus, who is also recognized as a teacher and leader.<p><b>the One who was with you beyond the Jordan,</b><br>This refers to Jesus, who had been baptized by John in the Jordan River. The Jordan River is significant in biblical history as a site of many important events, including the Israelites' crossing into the Promised Land. The phrase "beyond the Jordan" indicates a specific geographical location, emphasizing the historical and prophetic significance of Jesus' baptism as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and a symbol of new beginnings.<p><b>the One you testified about&#8212;</b><br>John the Baptist's role was to prepare the way for Jesus, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. His testimony about Jesus as the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>) was a pivotal moment in his ministry, pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. This phrase highlights John's recognition of Jesus' divine mission and authority, fulfilling the role of a forerunner as described in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>.<p><b>He is baptizing,</b><br>This indicates the continuation of the baptismal ministry, now associated with Jesus. Baptism was a ritual of purification and repentance in Jewish tradition, and Jesus' involvement in baptizing signifies the transition from John's preparatory work to the establishment of Jesus' ministry. It also foreshadows the Christian sacrament of baptism, symbolizing spiritual rebirth and the cleansing of sin.<p><b>and everyone is going to Him.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects the growing popularity of Jesus' ministry and the shift of followers from John to Jesus. It signifies the fulfillment of John's mission to point others to Christ, as he himself stated, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>). This movement towards Jesus underscores His role as the central figure of salvation history and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus, known for baptizing people in the Jordan River and calling for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john's_disciples.htm">John's Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of John the Baptist who were concerned about Jesus' growing popularity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Referred to as "the One" by John's disciples, He is the central figure of the New Testament, whose ministry was beginning to flourish.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant location for baptisms, symbolizing purification and repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_baptizing.htm">The Event of Baptizing</a></b><br>The act of baptizing by Jesus' disciples, which was drawing many people to Him, causing concern among John's followers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_ministry.htm">Humility in Ministry</a></b><br>John the Baptist exemplifies humility by recognizing and accepting the rise of Jesus' ministry.

The verse therefore calls every believer to celebrate, not resist, the rising glory of Jesus whenever and however it appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan.</span>--John's disciples, with a natural attachment to their master, and without the knowledge of what that master's work really was, are jealous of what seems to them the rival work of Jesus. He had been with John; the Baptist had borne witness to Him. Now He seems to usurp his work, and the throngs which had crowded to the Forerunner go to Him. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>; <a href="/john/4-2.htm" title="(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)">John 4:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Barest witness.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">hast borne witness.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span> (the disciples of John) <span class="cmt_word">came to John, and said to him, Rabbi</span> - the title of deep respect (ver. 2), which stood in Jewish reverence high above all civil and military rank, and was here yielded in courtesy to the heroic leader - <span class="cmt_word">he who was with thee,</span> apparently in entire mutual understanding with thee, receiving baptism at thy hands, and thus admitting thy right to baptize the people of God - "with thee" as we are "with thee" - <span class="cmt_word">beyond Jordan</span> - at Bethany (Bethabara), at a better baptizing - place than this, on a grand historic site, the very scene of the great administration, where the Sanhedrin deferred to thy claims and the multitudes attested the hold thou hadst <span class="cmt_word">on</span> their affections - <span class="cmt_word">to</span> <span class="cmt_word">whom thou hast borne testimonies</span> - the man who received thy homage, but who admitted also thy claims, about whom thou didst utter such strong things of unspeakable import - <span class="cmt_word">behold</span>, he is now thy rival in popular esteem; <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">man is baptizing, and</span> - with a pardonable exaggeration, they add - <span class="cmt_word">all men are coming unto him.</span> He is eclipsing thee; he seems to usurp the high and unique position which had been assumed by thyself. Serious questions these, which must lead to a complete disruption among the disciples of John. Before examining the reply of John to the query, it is well to observe that John had been walking in the blinding and bewildering light of new ideas; that the Fourth Gospel brings us into contact with John at the moment where the synoptic narrative draws its portraiture to a conclusion; and yet the Fourth Gospel, quite as firmly as the synoptists, shows that the fresh light which had dawned on John had not induced him to forego the preparatory mission on which his heart was set, and the zeal of which had consumed him. If the perplexity arises - How could John have borne such ample testimony to Jesus and not at once have followed in his train? we reply that the language of John in <a href="/matthew/3-14.htm">Matthew 3:14</a> is just as difficult to reconcile with the message from the prison. Thoma admits that this fact corresponds with the question, "Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?" In like manner, Hebraism itself within the bosom of the Church maintained a place after all its purpose had been fulfilled. The destruction of the temple and of the Jewish state was necessary to abolish the force of the Hebrew tendency to ritualism of place and symbol even in the heart of Christ's disciples. Many of the mighty powers of the world, if they had not possessed an energy and vitality which refused to succumb when their work was really done, would never have done that work at all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[John&#8217;s disciples] came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
