The concept of resurrection is rooted in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, which speaks of many who sleep in the dust of the earth awakening to everlasting life or shame. The idea of coming out from the grave signifies a physical resurrection, aligning with the belief in bodily resurrection as demonstrated by Jesus' own resurrection.<p><b>those who have done good to the resurrection of life,</b><br>This part emphasizes the moral and ethical dimension of Christian teaching. The "good" refers to living in accordance with God's commandments and the teachings of Jesus. This is not merely about actions but also about faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The "resurrection of life" is synonymous with eternal life, a promise for those who follow Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. This reflects the hope of believers for a future in the presence of God.<p><b>and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</b><br>This phrase highlights the dual outcome of the resurrection. "Those who have done evil" refers to those who have rejected God's ways and lived in sin. The "resurrection of judgment" indicates a future accountability before God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>, where the dead are judged according to their deeds. This underscores the biblical teaching of divine justice and the reality of eternal separation from God for those who do not repent.

It is remarkable that these are the only instances where the words here and there used for "practice" and for "evil" occur in St. John. This double opposition, and the use of words which He does not use again, support the distinction in the earlier Note. The passages are comments on each other. The law of the spiritual resurrection now is the law of that which shall be hereafter. Those who, working out the truth, come to the light now, that their deeds may be manifested, because they are wrought in God, shall in the final testing, when the secrets of every heart shall be revealed, rise unto the resurrection of life, to dwell in eternal light.
