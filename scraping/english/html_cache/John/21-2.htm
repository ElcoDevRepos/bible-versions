He was a fisherman by trade and was called by Jesus to be a "fisher of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). Peter is known for his boldness and leadership among the disciples, as well as his moments of doubt and denial of Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69-75</a>). After the resurrection, Peter became a foundational leader in the early church, as seen in the Book of Acts.<p><b>Thomas called Didymus</b><br>Thomas, also known as Didymus, meaning "twin," is famously known for his initial doubt about Jesus' resurrection, earning him the moniker "Doubting Thomas" (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>). His eventual confession of faith, "My Lord and my God," is a powerful declaration of Jesus' divinity. Thomas's presence here highlights the transformation from doubt to faith that many believers experience.<p><b>Nathanael from Cana in Galilee</b><br>Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew in the synoptic gospels, was from Cana in Galilee, the site of Jesus' first miracle of turning water into wine (<a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>). Nathanael was initially skeptical about Jesus, questioning if anything good could come from Nazareth (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>), but he quickly recognized Jesus as the Son of God and King of Israel (<a href="/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>).<p><b>the sons of Zebedee</b><br>The sons of Zebedee refer to James and John, who were also fishermen and among Jesus' closest disciples. They were part of Jesus' inner circle, witnessing significant events such as the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>). John is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation. James was the first apostle to be martyred (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>).<p><b>and two other disciples</b><br>The identity of these two other disciples is not specified, which may suggest their roles were less prominent in the gospel narratives. This anonymity can symbolize the many unnamed followers of Christ who played crucial roles in the early church. Their presence emphasizes the communal aspect of discipleship and the diverse backgrounds of Jesus' followers.<p><b>were together</b><br>The gathering of these disciples signifies unity and fellowship among Jesus' followers after His resurrection. This togetherness is a precursor to the formation of the early church community, which was characterized by shared faith, prayer, and mission (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>). It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise to be present where two or three are gathered in His name (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his leadership among the apostles and his denial of Jesus before the crucifixion.

Thomas is the apostle last mentioned by the evangelist. Elsewhere he is associated with Philip of Bethsaida, and this town may have been his home. <span class="cmt_word">Nathanael of Cana in Galilee</span> is mentioned by way of recalling the two miracles recorded by John as having taken place in this "Cana of Galilee" (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-12</a>; <a href="/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16</a>). The former of the miracles followed immediately on the mention of the calling of Nathanael (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>). The reference to the little place in Galilee where the glory of Christ had been first of all seen and had led to the faith of the disciples, calls attention to the place and province of this manifestation, and to what was contained in the memory of one of the witnesses. And <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (<span class="cmt_word">sons</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Zebedee</span> - a phrase used for James and John in <a href="/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>. This is the only time that Zebedee is mentioned in this Gospel; but the reason for his sons being thus designated points unmistakably to the first call of these two men to discipleship by the side of this very lake, after they had witnessed the draught of fishes, becoming from that time forward "fishers of men" (<a href="/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). That they should here be mentioned after Thomas and after Nathanael corresponds with the reticence and modesty of the evangelist. This is still more probable if the <span class="cmt_word">two other disciples</span> were <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> in the broader sense. The simple fact that they are mentioned after the five apostles has been thought by some to imply that, whosoever these were, they were not of the number of the eleven. No one writing the story in the second century would, in an enumeration like this, have placed the proto-martyr James and the intimate friend of Peter, the great "light of Asia," the admitted author of the Apocalypse, and the spiritual father of Polycarp and Papias, after Thomas and Nathanael. After his manner, he (the author) here prepared for the implicit subsequent identification of the "disciple whom Jesus loved," and also the author of the Gospel, with one of the sons of Zebedee. The supposition that Andrew and Philip are meant by the "two other disciples" is not without verisimilitude, from their mention in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. If this were the case, both of them are practically discriminated from the "disciple whom Jesus loved" by the obvious references to them elsewhere by name, while "John" never thus signalizes himself. The mention of seven disciples reveals the love of the writer for the number "seven," with its division into two groups of three and four (see Introduction, pp. 78, 79.). And it is remarkable that, if Andrew and Philip are the unnamed ones, the seven would correspond with the first seven apostles mentioned in Matthew's enumeration (Matthew 10:2-4). Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Judas the brother of James, or Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot were not present. This, of course, rests on the hypothesis that Nathanael and Bartholomew are identical (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
