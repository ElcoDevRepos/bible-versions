It reflects Jesus' divine nature and His unique relationship with God, emphasizing His role as the Son of God. This assurance of being heard by the Father is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus prays, such as in <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>. The confidence in being heard also underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's close relationship with God, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>.<p><b>but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here</b><br>Here, Jesus articulates His purpose in speaking aloud. His prayer is not for His own benefit but for those witnessing the event. This reflects Jesus' teaching method, often using situations to instruct and reveal truths to His followers. The context of this statement is the raising of Lazarus, a pivotal miracle that serves as a sign pointing to Jesus' divine authority and power over life and death. It also demonstrates Jesus' compassion and desire for others to come to faith.<p><b>so they may believe that You sent Me.</b><br>The ultimate goal of Jesus' public prayer is to lead the onlookers to faith. This statement ties into the broader theme of the Gospel of John, which is to reveal Jesus as the sent one from God, the Messiah, and the Son of God (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>). The miracle of raising Lazarus is a testament to Jesus' divine mission and authority, fulfilling the messianic expectations found in the Hebrew Scriptures.

"It is not for My own sake that I speak these words." This union of the will of the Father and the Son, by which every prayer of the Son was an expression of the will of the Father, and every work of the Father was in harmony with the will of the Son, was not exceptional, but the law of His human life. There is ever the consciousness, "I and My Father are one" (<a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">But because of the people which stand by I said it.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">because of the multitude.</span> He had before instructed the disciples and the sisters. He would instruct the multitude also, so that to them this "miracle" may be more than a wonder, and may teach them that He is sent of God. (Comp.

A continuous absolute communion is ever going on between heaven and earth in the heart of Jesus. His consciousness of the Father is a door opened in heaven. Alas! these words have been a stumbling-block to many; have suggested to Baur the idea of a "show-prayer," and to Weisse a "deceptive prayer" (<span class="accented">schaugebet</span>), and to Strauss that they were introduced into a later but in-authentic narrative of the second century to establish the Divinity of Christ. The simple fact is that the words are not "petition" at all, but they are spoken thought and Divine communion, graciously unveiled for the advantage of the disciples. They are built upon the wonderful assurance which had been repeatedly given by our Lord of his union with and association in unique Personality with the Father. We see from <a href="/john/16-29.htm">John 16:29-31</a> that the profound desire occupying the heart of Jesus was that his disciples, first of all, should know that he came out from God, and almost with pathetic eagerness he asks them, "Do ye now believe?" But in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a> he shows that his wishes were not limited to the faith of disciples, but extended to the production of a like conviction in the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Here he says, after a pause, "I know that thou art hearing me always." There is no surprise in the discovery that Lazarus was as he really is. Christ's own prayers are always heard, even those in Gethsemane and on the cross (cf. <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="accented">I said it for the multitude that standeth around</span>. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> reveals the genuine language of our Lord rather than that of the evangelist. To what does he refer, what saying has he uttered for the sake of this miscellaneous group? Surely to the great declaration, "I thank thee that thou heardest me." His reason for the audible utterance of his gratitude is, "That they may believe that thou didst send me." If he had <span class="accented">not</span> uttered this thanksgiving, the multitude would have glorified <span class="accented">him</span> rather than his Father, nor would they have learned, as now they may, that he came forth from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
