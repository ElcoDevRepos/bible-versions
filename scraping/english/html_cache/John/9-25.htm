His answer is given to the Pharisees who are questioning him. This reflects the boldness and confidence he has gained after his encounter with Jesus, despite the pressure from religious authorities.<p><b>Whether He is a sinner I do not know.</b><br>The man acknowledges his limited understanding of Jesus' nature. The Pharisees had accused Jesus of being a sinner for healing on the Sabbath. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who often accused Him of breaking the law. The man's statement shows his focus on personal experience over theological debate.<p><b>There is one thing I do know:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty and simplicity of the man's testimony. It highlights the importance of personal experience and testimony in the Christian faith. The man speaks from his own transformation, which is undeniable and powerful.<p><b>I was blind, but now I see!</b><br>This statement is both literal and metaphorical. Literally, the man was physically blind and received sight through Jesus' miracle. Metaphorically, it represents spiritual enlightenment and transformation, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospel of John. This phrase echoes the transformative power of Jesus, who brings light to darkness, as seen in <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a> where Jesus declares Himself the Light of the World. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual awakening and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was blind from birth and was healed by Jesus.
