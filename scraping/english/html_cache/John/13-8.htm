It was a sign of hospitality but also of humility. Peter's refusal reflects his reverence for Jesus, whom he sees as his Lord and Teacher, and he cannot fathom Jesus performing such a menial task. This moment highlights Peter's misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom, which is characterized by servanthood and humility (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>Peter told Him.</b><br>Peter often acts as the spokesperson for the disciples, reflecting his leadership role among them. His impulsive nature is evident throughout the Gospels, such as when he attempts to walk on water (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-31</a>) or when he declares Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>). This statement is consistent with his character, showing both his devotion and his lack of full understanding of Jesus' teachings.<p><b>Jesus answered, &#8220;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' response is both literal and symbolic. Literally, it refers to the act of foot washing, but symbolically, it points to the spiritual cleansing necessary for fellowship with Him. This cleansing foreshadows the ultimate purification through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). The phrase "you have no part with Me" emphasizes the necessity of accepting Jesus' work for salvation and fellowship. It echoes the concept of being part of the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>, where believers are united with Him through faith and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is performing the act of washing the disciples' feet as a demonstration of servanthood and cleansing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature.

Note on <a href="/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>. The incidental touches of character where individual apostles are named in this Gospel are in striking agreement with the more fully-drawn character of the other evangelists, and the value of their evidence for the authorship cannot be over-estimated. They are perfectly artless, but are beyond the most consummate art. We feel that it is the loving, impulsive, but self-confident Peter of the earlier Gospels who is speaking here. He does not wait for that after-knowledge which our Lord promises him. He sees no ground on which our Lord's act can possibly be one which he can permit. Note that the emphasis is on the negative. The pronoun "my" is again not to be emphasised, nor is "Thou" in this passage. "Thou shalt <span class= "ital">never</span> wash my feet."<p><span class= "bld">If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</span>--Our Lord has already intimated (<a href="/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>) that His deed was symbolic, and He now refers to the truth underlying the outer act. The key to His meaning is to be found in His own words in <a href="/context/john/13-13.htm" title="You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.">John 13:13-17</a>. By the act of washing their feet, He, their Lord, taught the spirit of self-sacrifice and love in opposition to the spirit of self-seeking and pride which ruled even in the Apostles' hearts. That lesson every servant and apostle of Jesus Christ must learn, for the servant is. not greater than the Lord, nor the Apostle than the Sender. That lesson Peter was refusing to learn in the pride of his own impulsive will, which seemed to be humility. But unless he learns to accept the love of Christ's humiliation, and is so cleansed by its power that he yields his human will wholly to the divine, and learns in self-sacrifice what the spirit of Christ really is, he can have no part in Him. The lesson is a hard one, but it is necessary; the sacrifice of will may be harder than that of life; but the strong man must become as the little child before he can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.<p>For the phrase, "Thou hast no part with me," which is again a Hebrew thought in Greek dress, comp. <a href="/matthew/24-51.htm" title="And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 24:51</a>, and <a href="/luke/12-46.htm" title="The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.">Luke 12:46</a>.
