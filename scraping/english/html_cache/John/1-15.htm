His testimony is significant because it fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where a voice cries out in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord. John's role as a forerunner to Christ is also highlighted in <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>. His testimony establishes Jesus' divine identity and mission, setting the stage for His public ministry.<p><b>He cried out, saying,</b><br>The phrase "cried out" indicates the urgency and importance of John's message. In the cultural context of the time, public proclamation was a primary means of communication, and John's bold declaration would have drawn significant attention. This public announcement underscores the prophetic nature of John's ministry and his role as a herald of the Messiah.<p><b>&#8220;This is He of whom I said,</b><br>John's statement points back to his previous declarations about the coming Messiah. This consistency in his message reinforces his credibility as a prophet. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative, where prophets often pointed to the coming of a savior, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a prophet like himself whom God will raise up.<p><b>&#8216;He who comes after me</b><br>John acknowledges that Jesus' ministry follows his own, aligning with the cultural expectation of a forerunner preparing the way for someone greater. This sequence is significant in the context of Jewish tradition, where the arrival of a new leader or teacher often followed a period of preparation and anticipation.<p><b>has surpassed me</b><br>John's recognition of Jesus' superiority is a testament to his humility and understanding of his role. This acknowledgment is crucial, as it highlights the transition from the old covenant, represented by John, to the new covenant, inaugurated by Jesus.

It aligns with the prologue of John's Gospel, which declares that the Word was with God in the beginning (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>). This assertion of Jesus' eternal nature connects to Old Testament references to the divine nature of the Messiah, such as in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which speaks of a ruler from Bethlehem whose origins are from ancient times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for baptizing Jesus and calling people to repentance.

Note on <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>. The writer thinks of the testimony as ever present, ever forceful. Twice on successive days had he heard them from the lips of the Baptist; three times within a few verses does he himself record them. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>; <a href="/john/1-30.htm" title="This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:30</a>.) They are among the words stamped on the heart in the crisis of life, and as fresh in the aged Apostle as they had been in the youthful inquirer. He remembers how he heard them, and from whom they came. That wondrous spiritual power in their midst which all men felt, whose witness men would have accepted had he declared that he was himself the Christ, uttered his witness then, and it holds good now. It is quoted here as closely bound up with the personal reminiscence of <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, and with the thought of <a href="/context/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6-7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The testimony to this fact by the prophetic spirit.</span> The evangelist, in support and vindication of the profound impression produced upon himself and others by the Christ, cites the startling and paradoxical testimony of the Baptist, which in John's own hearing the great forerunner had twice uttered, under very extraordinary circumstances (see vers. 26, 30). In the later verses this testimony is put in its proper place. Its repetition deepens the impression which the narrative gives of the vivid reality, and of the fact that the evangelist was trusting to a strongly impressed recollection, and is not romanticizing, as the Tubingen critics suppose. The sharp paradoxical form is thoroughly characteristic of the man who called on scribes and Pharisees to "repent," and spoke of God raising up seed to Abraham from the stones of the ground. From the synoptists we learn that John declared that the Coming One was "mightier" than himself, would deal with the Holy Ghost and with fire as he was able to do with water. He knew not the kind of manifestation which was coming on apace. But an enormous change passed over John the Baptist when he came into contact with our Lord, and at his baptism he sank abashed before the revelations which flashed on his soul. The enigmatical form of the Baptist's utterances was the beginning of the evangelist's faith in the personal pre-existence of the Logos who had become flesh in Christ. The testimony of the Baptist is here brought in, as the last great word of the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament, apart from the historic setting in which it afterwards occurs, as if, moreover, it was an abiding word which was yet sounding in the ears of men. The greatest of the sons of woman, and "more than a prophet," he who gathered up in his immense personality all the functions of prophet, priest, Nazarite, and master and teacher of men, the Elijah of the new revelation - John, the very ideal of Divine and supernatural voice in this world of ours, John, the veritable historic man, moreover, to whose disastrous martyrdom some of the Jews (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18, 5, 2) referred the terrible judgments that befell their nation - <span class="cmt_word">John</span> <span class="cmt_word">beareth witness</span>. That was his function, and his testimony still stands, his "voice" is still heard wherever his great career is known or properly appreciated - in Palestine, in Alexandria, in Ephesus or Corinth. And <span class="cmt_word">he crieth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); or, <span class="accented">hath cried</span>; and the cry is still heard among men: <span class="cmt_word">This was he of whom I spake</span>; implying that John uttered words of strange enigmatical significance before he saw Jesus coming to his baptism, and that, as the evangelist subsequently shows, on two memorable occasions, the prophet recalled them and reaffirmed their truthfulness. Before I saw him, I said it: <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming after me hath become</span> - hath been in mighty activity - <span class="cmt_word">before me</span>. He came forth in many ways from the Father, and was the central reality of the old covenant; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he hath come in the voice of the Lord, in the Shechinah glory, in the Angel of the <span class="accented">presence</span>, chronologically "before me." The English Version has followed the traditionary interpretation from Chrysostom to Lucke, De Wette, Alford, McLellan, and has seen in this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> a reference to the higher rank or dignity of the Logos <span class="accented">incarnate</span>, and translated the second clause "is preferred before me," or "hath been made before me," etc. But such a statement would not have conveyed any thought of great importance. A herald is naturally exceeded and superseded by the dignity and rank of him for whom he prepares the way. Moreover, the two adverbs of place are used in metaphorical sense as adverbs of time (derived from the relative position of individuals in a line or procession), and it is scarcely probable that the second should be used in another sense altogether, which would have disturbed the antithesis between them. On the other hand, Hengstenberg, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc., recognize the perception of the Baptist, and his utterance of belief in the pre-existence of the Christ, and that from such passages as <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> he knew that he who was coming into the world, and about to baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire, to take the fan in his hand, etc., had been in reality <span class="accented">before him.</span> The difficulty of this interpretation is said to be that the proof which follows - <span class="cmt_word">because</span>, or <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>he was before me</span> - would be tautologous in the extreme; the reason given for the Lord having become before him being simply the asseveration of the fact. But the two very remarkable expressions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bd;</span>, are not identical. The first may easily refer to the historic precedence of the activity of the Coming One in all the operations of the Logos; the second may refer to the absolute and eternal precedence of the Logos in itself. If so, the whole significance of the previous fourteen verses is gathered up, and shown to have been flashed upon the consciousness of John the Baptist, and uttered with such intensity that the evangelist caught the idea, and saw in it the key to the whole mystery. It would seem, however, that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> did not form part of the original utterance of John. After the baptism, the whole truth had broken upon the Baptist, and he clenched or saw an explanation of the mystery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">John</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">testified</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(martyrei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3140.htm">Strong's 3140: </a> </span><span class="str2">To witness, bear witness, give evidence, testify, give a good report.
