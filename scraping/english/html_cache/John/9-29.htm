Moses is a central figure in Jewish history, having led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Law on Mount Sinai. The Pharisees' statement underscores their reliance on the Torah as the foundation of their faith and practice. In the broader biblical context, Moses is often seen as a type of Christ, a deliverer and mediator between God and His people. The reference to God speaking to Moses highlights the direct communication and covenant relationship established between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>.<p><b>but we do not know where this man is from.</b><br>This part of the verse reveals the Pharisees' skepticism and rejection of Jesus' divine authority and messianic identity. Their statement reflects a common theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' origins and authority are questioned (<a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a>, <a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>). The phrase "where this man is from" can be understood both geographically and spiritually. While they may be aware of Jesus' earthly origins in Nazareth, they fail to recognize His divine origin as the Son of God. This ignorance or refusal to acknowledge Jesus' true identity fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men. The contrast between their certainty about Moses and uncertainty about Jesus highlights their spiritual blindness, a central theme in <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, where Jesus heals a man born blind, symbolizing the opening of spiritual eyes to recognize the truth of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is the prophet through whom God delivered the Law to Israel.

The Pharisees affirm God&#8217;s past revelation to Moses yet reject the living fulfillment standing before them. Their claim to &#8220;know&#8221; exposes their pride; their confession of ignorance reveals willful unbelief. True knowledge embraces both Moses and the One Moses foretold&#8212;Jesus, the Light of the World, whose works and words attest that He is unmistakably &#8220;from God.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">We know that God spake unto Moses.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">We know that God hath spoken unto Moses.</span> "He was commissioned," they would say, "by God, and received a revelation from God which remains to us." They would press here, as before, the authority of the great Lawgiver, which to every Israelite was final. They will not, therefore, accept this Man as a prophet. Their words have tacit reference also to the fact that His works were in their eyes a transgression of the Mosaic law. There is an opposition between them. Both cannot be right, and they will themselves continue to be disciples of Moses. He, it is implied, by confessing Jesus to be a prophet, was practically denying the authority of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">As for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</span>--In our English version the words in italics are added, but they do not express more than the single Greek word, which is used with contempt. Before they had said, "Howbeit we know this Man whence He is; but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence He is" (<a href="/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>; see Notes on this and the next verse). They here oppose the divine authority of the mission of Moses, which was acknowledged by all, to the absence, as they would say, of any such authority for the work of Jesus. Their words are meant to convey more than they express, coming as they do in sharp contrast with "God spake unto Moses." They would say again, "This Man is not of God" (<a href="/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>), "we know that this Man is a sinner" (<a href="/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>).

We know - it is the fundamental fact of our religions history, and of the Divine revelation entrusted to us. <span class="cmt_word">We know</span>, by supreme conviction, as something almost equivalent to a fundamental law of thought, <span class="cmt_word">that God hath spoken to Moses.</span> (Observe the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "hath spoken" in such fashion that his words abide fur ever and are still sounding in their ears.) Moses was made a little lower than the angels. God spake to him on Sinai, and from the mercy-scat, and face to face as a man speaketh with his friend (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The most august ideas and associations clustered round his venerable name. Jesus was supposed to have challenged the supreme authority of Moses, and no sort of comparison could be drawn, in their opinion, between the two. <span class="cmt_word">But as for this Man, we know not whence he is</span>. It is remarkable that, in <a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a>, they had been equally explicit in declaring, "We know whence he <span class="accented">is</span>." Then they thought to discredit iris Messianic claim by drawing a distinction between the well-known parentage and home of Jesus, and the coming of Messiah from some undiscoverable source, some hidden place, where God retained him before his revelation to Israel (see notes, <a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 28</a>). While, however, Christ (<a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>) allowed the validity of their superficial knowledge on that occasion, he declared that he alone knew whence he came and whither he was going (see notes, <a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>). It is, perhaps, in reference to this last expression that they echo his own words. The supernatural source of his being and teaching seemed to their minds, throughout that discourse and controversy, to vacillate between the Divine and the demonic. The contrast between Moses and Jesus in this bitter speech runs along the same low level. "We know not whence" he derives his prophetic character, or his right to legislate for the people of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
