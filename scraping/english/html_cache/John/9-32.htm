In the Jewish tradition, miracles were often seen as signs of divine intervention. The statement underscores the uniqueness of Jesus' ministry and the power He wielded, which was unlike anything previously recorded in Jewish history or scripture. This sets the stage for understanding Jesus as a figure who transcends the expectations of a typical prophet or healer.<p><b>of opening the eyes</b><br>The act of opening the eyes is symbolic of spiritual enlightenment and revelation. In biblical literature, blindness often represents spiritual ignorance or lack of understanding, while sight is associated with knowledge and insight. This miracle not only addresses physical blindness but also serves as a metaphor for the spiritual awakening that Jesus brings. It connects to prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened as a sign of the Messiah's coming.<p><b>of a man born blind.</b><br>The detail that the man was born blind highlights the severity and hopelessness of his condition, making the miracle even more remarkable. In the cultural context of the time, congenital blindness was often viewed as a result of sin, either of the individual or their parents, as seen in <a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>. Jesus' healing of this man challenges these assumptions and demonstrates His authority over sin and its consequences. This act also prefigures the new creation and restoration that Jesus brings, as He reverses the effects of the fall and sin in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of healing a man born blind, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was blind from birth, representing those in spiritual darkness who are given sight through Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who questioned the miracle, representing skepticism and spiritual blindness despite physical sight.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle.htm">The Miracle</a></b><br>The healing of the blind man, a sign of Jesus' messianic identity and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_jesus.htm">Divine Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to heal a man born blind underscores His divine nature and authority over creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness_vs._physical_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness vs. Physical Blindness</a></b><br>The miracle serves as a metaphor for spiritual blindness, urging believers to seek spiritual sight through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' actions fulfill Old Testament prophecies, affirming His identity as the Messiah and encouraging trust in God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_testimony.htm">Faith and Testimony</a></b><br>The healed man's testimony challenges believers to boldly share their experiences of Christ's transformative power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/skepticism_and_belief.htm">Skepticism and Belief</a></b><br>The Pharisees' skepticism contrasts with the blind man's faith, prompting reflection on openness to God's work in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_9_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 9:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_9_32_Jesus_divine_healing_power.htm">How does John 9:32 demonstrate Jesus' divine authority and power over physical ailments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faith_from_John_9_32_healing.htm">What can we learn about faith from the man's healing in John 9:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/John_9_32_and_Messiah_prophecies_link.htm">How does John 9:32 connect to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_John_9_32_s_miracle_guide_us.htm">In what ways can we apply the miracle in John 9:32 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_s_unique_works_today.htm">How does John 9:32 encourage us to trust in God's unprecedented works today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_9_32_s_impact_on_modern_miracles.htm">How does John 9:32 challenge the belief in miracles today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_John_9_32_healing.htm">Why is the healing of the blind man significant in John 9:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_9_32_Jesus_divine_authority.htm">What does John 9:32 reveal about Jesus' divine authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_the_bible_genuinely_one-of-a-kind.htm">What does being red-pilled mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_the_crowd_unsure_about_the_man.htm">In John 9:8&#8211;9, why does the crowd seem uncertain about recognizing the healed man?

Even mighty prophets like Elijah and Elisha performed dramatic wonders, yet none opened the eyes of the congenitally blind (cf. <a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a> had promised, &#8220;The LORD opens the eyes of the blind,&#8221; but until this day the promise had not been historically realized.<p>&#8226; The uniqueness of the miracle highlights Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah foretold in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, &#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,&#8221; establishing that the prophecy was now fulfilled in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has anyone heard</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points to collective human experience&#8212;no rumor, tradition, or rabbinic writing ever hinted at such a wonder. Nicodemus voiced a similar recognition earlier: &#8220;Rabbi, we know that You have come from God, for no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a> notes, &#8220;From ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived&#8230; what God has prepared for those who wait for Him.&#8221; Jesus&#8217; act reveals what had been hidden from human hearing: God&#8217;s power to reverse congenital brokenness.<p>&#8226; The witness emphasis underscores credibility; the healed man appeals to common knowledge, reinforcing that the miracle is undeniable and publicly verifiable (<a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of opening the eyes</b><p>&#8226; Sight is a gift only the Creator can bestow (<a href="/exodus/4-11.htm">Exodus 4:11</a>). By doing what only God can do, Jesus implicitly claims divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a> records Jesus listing &#8220;the blind receive sight&#8221; among messianic credentials. The miracle fulfills that list in real time.<p>&#8226; It also symbolizes spiritual illumination. Later Jesus declares, &#8220;I have come into this world so that the blind will see&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>). Physical restoration becomes a living parable of spiritual conversion (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of a man born blind</b><p>&#8226; John carefully notes the man was &#8220;blind from birth&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>), emphasizing an incurable, lifelong condition. No natural recovery or medical treatment could explain the change.<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; earlier question about sin (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>) is answered here: the man&#8217;s condition existed &#8220;that the works of God might be displayed&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus not only heals but re-creates; the same God who &#8220;formed man from the dust of the ground&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) now forms functioning eyes where none had functioned.<p>&#8226; Skeptics later ask, &#8220;Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-21.htm">John 10:21</a>). The implied answer is no&#8212;only God&#8217;s Anointed can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-32.htm">John 9:32</a> proclaims the unprecedented nature of Jesus&#8217; miracle. No prior prophet, priest, or healer had ever given sight to someone born blind. The statement therefore spotlights Jesus as the unique, divine Messiah who fulfills prophecy, exercises Creator power, and turns an impossible condition into a testimony of God&#8217;s glory, confirming both His identity and His mission to bring light to a darkened world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Since the world began was it not heard.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">from the world-age was it not heard.</span> The phrase is a reminiscence of <a href="/isaiah/64-4.htm" title="For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.">Isaiah 64:4</a>.

The man expresses what was simply true, that no science or skill had at that time been equal to the removal of blindness which had accompanied birth. That modern science has succeeded in making even this possible, is altogether beside the question, unless it is pretended that human skill could effect it under like conditions and with the same means. For the man himself there had been years of darkness without a ray of hope, for none had ever dreamt that recovery was within the limits of possibility; and now that the blessing has come, he regards it as the gift of God, and doubts not that the immediate giver is from God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - The man, having once begun, will not be stopped in his argument. <span class="cmt_word">Since the world began</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament; we have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> three times, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> There is no record of any cure of blindness in the Old Testament. The miracle stands forth with grand distinctness on the page of history. If such stories had been told, neither he nor the author of this narrative knew of them. The Pharisees and Jews have no reply to this burst of grateful but indignant testimony to the uniqueness of his Deliverer, and then, with a home-thrust which cut through their weak objections and repudiated their cruel inferences, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Unless this Man were from God, he could do nothing</span>; he could neither have wrought this marvel, nor any of the deep impressions wrought upon you. "From God;" that is the man's final answer to the query, "What sayest thou of him, seeing that he hath opened thine eyes?" God has the glory, while I repudiate what you give as a judgment against him. Verily God has heard him as One who in this thing has simply done his will. Thus the Jews are compelled for a few moments to hear, from one known as a street-beggar, words of teaching along the finest lines of a deep experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Never</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ouk)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
