In the cultural context of a first-century Jewish meal, sharing a morsel was a gesture of friendship and honor. However, in this instance, it marks the moment of Judas's final decision to betray Jesus. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where David speaks of being betrayed by a close friend. The giving of the morsel signifies the culmination of Judas's internal struggle and the beginning of his active betrayal.<p><b>Judas went out</b><br>Judas's departure from the gathering is significant. It marks the physical separation from Jesus and the other disciples, symbolizing his spiritual and moral departure as well. This act of leaving is a turning point in the narrative of the Passion, setting in motion the events that will lead to Jesus's arrest and crucifixion. Judas's exit is a fulfillment of Jesus's earlier prediction that one of His disciples would betray Him (<a href="/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a>). It also highlights the theme of light versus darkness, as Judas chooses to leave the presence of the Light of the World.<p><b>into the night</b><br>The mention of "night" is not merely a time indicator but carries deep symbolic meaning. In the Gospel of John, night often represents spiritual darkness and evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-21</a>). Judas's departure into the night underscores his alignment with darkness and his rejection of the light that Jesus offers. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of light and darkness, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a> and <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>. The night also foreshadows the coming hours of Jesus's suffering and the apparent triumph of darkness, which will ultimately be overcome by the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver.

Judas&#8217; decision had already been set in motion (<a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>); the morsel simply marked the point of no return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judas went out</b><p>&#8226; Stepping away from the table meant leaving the intimate circle of fellowship with Jesus and the other disciples.

He forfeited truth that could have led him to repentance, a tragic contrast with Peter&#8217;s later restoration (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; John later writes, &#8220;They went out from us, but they did not belong to us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>); Judas exemplifies that painful reality.<p>&#8226; This departure sets in motion the arrest (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2&#8211;5</a>) and crucifixion, showing how individual choices can advance God&#8217;s sovereign plan even while remaining fully responsible (<a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into the night</b><p>&#8226; John adds, &#8220;And it was night&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a>).

When Jesus is arrested, He says, &#8220;This is your hour&#8212;and the dominion of darkness&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>). Judas&#8217; exit previewed that very moment.<p>&#8226; The night also hints at finality. Judas will not return to the light; instead, he will complete the betrayal (<a href="/matthew/26-47.htm">Matthew 26:47&#8211;50</a>) and eventually meet a tragic end (<a href="/acts/1-25.htm">Acts 1:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/13-30.htm">John 13:30</a> captures a turning point in a single sentence: the instant Judas received a final offer of grace, he decisively rejected it, removed himself from fellowship, and stepped into literal and moral darkness.

He went out, and went out into the darkness of night. We cannot say that the writer meant them to express more than this, and yet we feel that there is in them a fulness of meaning that cannot have been unintentional. It was night; and he stepped forth from light into darkness; from the presence and guidance of the Light of the World, to be possessed by and guided by the prince of darkness. It was night; and St. John could hardly have written these words without remembering those he had written but a short time before: "If a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him." (See Note on <a href="/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>.) Comp., for the way in which St. John gives emphasis to a tragic fulness of meaning by expressing it in a short detached sentence, <a href="/john/11-35.htm" title="Jesus wept.">John 11:35</a>; <a href="/john/18-40.htm" title="Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.">John 18:40</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.</span> There is no advantage to be secured by omitting the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, and connecting the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;</span> with the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, nor is it preferred by the later editors. The immediate departure of Judas when he had taken the sop is compatible with all the context - a horror of the shadow of death falls on the tragic scene. He at least passes out into the outer darkness, apt symbol of his soul and of his deed. Hengstenberg imagines the Lord's Supper to have followed the previous words, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> must be interpreted with some laxity, leaving time for the sacred meal to have been instituted and the solemn song to have been sung. It is difficult to say where the Eucharistic service is to be introduced, and every possible suggestion has been made. The statement of <a href="/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21, 22</a> makes it probable that the traitor was present at it. And all the synoptists make the indication of the traitor follow the institution of the Eucharist, and two of them place it on the very way to the garden of Gethsemane. Bengel, in harmony with his chronological scheme, supposes that the traitor went out and returned. According to Keim, the Eucharistic meal may be supposed to be introduced at the close of <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14</a>. and before the discourse on the vine; but that discourse follows a summons of Jesus to his disciples to leave the upper chamber. And every attempt to find a place for it in the midst of the valedictory discourse is unsatisfactory (see these amply discussed in Godet, Lucke, Meyer). Thus Paulus, etc., place it after ver. 30. Lucke and Meyer, between vers. 33 and 34; but Peter's question looks back to ver. 33, allowing no such break. Neander and Ebrard place after ver. 32. Tholuck, after ver. 34, Lange identifies it with the new commandment; and Bengel makes the discourse down to <a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a> precede Christ's journey to Jerusalem to keep the Passover, so that no clashing takes place. I think that the simplest solution of the difficulty is to put it at the commencement of the feast, and in the folds as it were of the sentence in <a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>, which tells us that Jesus loved his disciples to the uttermost (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The endeavor made by Strauss, to argue from the silence of the fourth evangelist that he knew nothing of the institution of the Eucharist, is a great exaggeration. The synoptic tradition must, <span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span> of the late authorship of the Gospel, be well known to the author, and <a href="/1_corinthians/11-33.htm">1 Corinthians 11:33</a>, etc., was ample proof of its historic basis. There was, in the entire representation of this Gospel, an intense perception of the inner meaning of the Eucharist, and of the new covenant and commandment based on the assumption of the Passion and death of the incarnate God; so that instead of describing the ceremonial, he expounds its ideas (see Introduction, pp. 105, 106.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver, 31</span> - <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>. - 3.
