In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus often speaks of His unity with the Father, indicating that rejecting Him is equivalent to rejecting God (<a href="/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>). The concept of judgment is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>). The rejection of Jesus is not merely a personal decision but a spiritual one with eternal consequences. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes accountability before God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p><b>and does not receive My words:</b><br>Receiving Jesus' words is synonymous with accepting His teachings and authority. In the cultural context of the first century, a rabbi's words were considered binding and authoritative. Jesus' words are not just teachings but are life-giving (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). The refusal to accept His words is a rejection of the truth He embodies (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This phrase also connects to the parable of the sower, where the seed (the word of God) falls on different types of soil, representing the varied responses to Jesus' message (<a href="/matthew/13-18.htm">Matthew 13:18-23</a>).<p><b>The word that I have spoken will judge him</b><br>Here, Jesus underscores the power and authority of His spoken word. In the biblical tradition, God's word is active and powerful (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). Jesus' words are not merely informative but transformative and carry the weight of divine authority. This echoes the idea that the Scriptures themselves bear witness to Jesus and will be the standard by which people are judged (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>). The emphasis on "the word" highlights the importance of Scripture in the life of believers and its role in judgment.<p><b>on the last day.</b><br>The "last day" refers to the eschatological end times, a common theme in both the Old and New Testaments. This is the day of final judgment, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and reiterated in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>). The concept of a final day of reckoning is central to Christian eschatology, where all individuals will be held accountable for their response to Jesus Christ. This phrase serves as a reminder of the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the consequences of rejecting His message. He is central to the Christian faith as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Jesus is speaking to a mixed group, including His disciples and the general public, some of whom are skeptical or outright reject His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_day.htm">The Last Day</a></b><br>This refers to the eschatological event when final judgment will occur. It is a significant concept in Christian theology, emphasizing accountability and the culmination of God's plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word.htm">The Word</a></b><br>The teachings and message of Jesus, which are rooted in divine authority and truth. In Greek, "logos" is used, indicating not just spoken words but the divine reason and plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The act of divine evaluation and decision-making regarding human actions and beliefs, particularly concerning acceptance or rejection of Jesus' message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_jesus'_words.htm">The Authority of Jesus' Words</a></b><br>Jesus' words carry divine authority and are not merely suggestions but commands that demand a response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_judgment.htm">The Reality of Judgment</a></b><br>There is a future judgment where our response to Jesus' words will be evaluated.
