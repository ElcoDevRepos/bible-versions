In the context of <a href="/john/21.htm">John 21</a>, Jesus is addressing Peter after His resurrection. The setting is significant as it occurs by the Sea of Galilee, a place of previous miracles and teachings. Jesus' response is part of a larger conversation about Peter's future and his role in the early church.<p><b>If I want him to remain until I return</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to the beloved disciple, traditionally understood to be John. This statement has been the subject of much theological discussion. It suggests Jesus' sovereign will over the lives of His followers. The phrase "until I return" alludes to the Second Coming, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This reflects the early church's expectation of Christ's imminent return, as seen in other New Testament writings like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15-17</a>.<p><b>what is that to you?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes personal responsibility and the individual nature of discipleship. Jesus redirects Peter's focus from curiosity about others to his own calling. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of personal accountability before God, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>, where each person is accountable to God for their own actions.<p><b>You follow Me!</b><br>The command "You follow Me" is a call to discipleship, echoing Jesus' initial invitation to Peter in <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>. It underscores the importance of obedience and commitment to Christ above all else. This imperative is central to the Christian life, as following Jesus involves a personal relationship and a willingness to embrace His teachings and mission. The call to follow is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the cost and reward of true discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the resurrected Lord who is speaking to His disciples, providing guidance and instruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter (Simon Peter)</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, Peter is the one being directly addressed by Jesus in this verse.

The possibility that John could remain until that day shows Jesus&#8217; return is real and, from a human perspective, imminent.<p>&#8226; Whether John lived to see it or not is secondary; the certainty is that Christ will indeed come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what is that to you?</b><p>- Jesus gently corrects Peter&#8217;s curiosity: &#8220;what is that to you?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Comparison distracts from obedience. Paul echoes this: &#8220;Who are you to judge another&#8217;s servant? To his own master he stands or falls&#8221; (<a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Each believer carries a unique assignment: &#8220;Let each one examine his own work&#8230; each will bear his own load&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God &#8220;has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as He desired&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>). Peter&#8217;s task is not to micromanage John&#8217;s story but to steward his own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You follow Me!</b><p>- The command distills discipleship: personal, continual, undivided.<p>&#8226; Earlier Jesus said, &#8220;Whoever serves Me must follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Following entails self-denial and daily cross-bearing (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>), persevering toward &#8220;the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter will shortly lead the Jerusalem church and ultimately glorify God in martyrdom (<a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>). His success hinges on locking eyes with the Shepherd, not on gauging another disciple&#8217;s path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/21-22.htm">John 21:22</a> teaches that Jesus sovereignly directs each believer&#8217;s life, holds the timing of His return, forbids fruitless comparison, and calls every disciple to steadfast, personal obedience. Our role is clear and constant: keep following Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</span>--The answer must be taken as reproving the spirit which would inquire into another's life and work, with the effect of weakening the force of its own. Here, as in all the earlier details of St. Peter's life, his character is emotional, earnest, loving, but wanting in depth, and not without self-confidence. The words "Follow Me," the meaning of which he has not missed, may well have led him to thoughts and questions of what that path should be, and the truth may well have sunk into the depth of his heart, there to germinate and burst forth in principle and act. But he is at once taken up with other thoughts. He is told to follow, but is ready to lead. He would know and guide his friend's life rather than his own. To him, and to all, there comes the truth that the Father is the husbandman, and it is He who trains every branch of the vine. There is a spiritual companionship which strengthens and helps all who join in it; there is a spiritual guidance which is not without danger to the true strength of him that is led, nor yet to that of him who leads.<p>The word rendered "tarry" is that which we have before had for "abide" (see <a href="/john/12-34.htm" title="The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?">John 12:34</a>, and comp. <a href="/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Philippians 1:25</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1Corinthians 15:6</a>). It is here opposed to "Follow Me" (in the martyrdom), and means to abide in life.<p>The phrase, "If I will that he tarry till I come," is one of those the meaning of which cannot be ascertained with certainty, and to which, therefore, every variety of meaning has been given. We have already seen that the Coming of the Lord was thought of in more than one sense. (Comp. especially Notes on <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a> and Matthew 24; and see also in this Gospel, Note on <a href="/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>.) The interpretation which has found most support is that which takes the "coming of the Lord" to mean the destruction of Jerusalem, which St. John, and perhaps he only of the Apostles, lived to see. But the context seems to exclude this meaning, for the mistake of <a href="/john/21-23.htm" title="Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?">John 21:23</a> would surely have been corrected by a reference to the fact that St. John had survived, and wrote the Gospel after, the "coming of the Lord." The interpretation which the next verse itself suggests is that our Lord made no statement, but expressed a supposition, "If I will," "If it even be that I will;" and this both gives the exact meaning of the Greek, and corresponds with the remainder of our Lord's answer. He is directing St. Peter to think of his own future. and not of his friend's; and He puts a supposition which, even if it were true, would not make that friend's life a subject for him then to think of. Had our Lord told him that St. John should remain on earth until His coming, in any sense of the word, then He would have given an answer, which He clearly declined to give. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
