His role was to maintain order and enforce Roman law. The Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate because they lacked the authority to execute someone under Roman rule. Pilate's action of going out to them indicates a level of respect for Jewish customs, as entering the praetorium would have made the Jewish leaders ceremonially unclean during Passover (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>). This reflects the tension between Roman authority and Jewish religious practices.<p><b>and asked,</b><br>Pilate's inquiry demonstrates his role as a judge in this legal proceeding. Roman trials often began with the magistrate asking for the charges against the accused. This question sets the stage for the legal examination of Jesus, highlighting the Roman legal system's procedural nature. Pilate's questioning also shows his initial impartiality, as he seeks to understand the situation before making a judgment.<p><b>&#8220;What accusation are you bringing against this man?&#8221;</b><br>This question is crucial as it requires the Jewish leaders to present a formal charge against Jesus. The term "accusation" implies a legal complaint that must be substantiated with evidence. The Jewish leaders' response would determine the course of the trial. This moment fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>) and foreshadows His role as the innocent Lamb led to slaughter (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The question also underscores the theme of Jesus' innocence, as Pilate later finds no basis for a charge against Him (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who played a crucial role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.

Their scrupulous concern for ceremonial purity stands in sharp contrast to their intent to condemn Jesus.<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s choice to step outside illustrates the Roman governor accommodating Jewish sensitivities, yet also highlights how God&#8217;s sovereign plan used even pagan authority to advance redemption (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; By standing before Israel&#8217;s leaders, Jesus fulfills prophecies of being &#8220;despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>) and of kings and rulers taking counsel against the Lord&#8217;s Anointed (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked,</b><p>&#8226; Pilate opens with a question rather than a verdict, underscoring the principle of due process.

Their later appeal to Roman law (&#8220;We have no right to execute anyone,&#8221; <a href="/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>) reveals their dependence on imperial power to carry out their plot.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What accusation are you bringing against this man?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;accusation&#8221; shows Pilate demanding a formal, legal indictment. He will not execute without stated cause (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> sets a similar standard under the Law).<p>&#8226; The question forces the leaders to choose between spiritual allegations (blasphemy, <a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>) and political ones (treason, <a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). They eventually opt for the political, hoping to secure a death sentence.<p>&#8226; Behind the courtroom scene stands a greater trial: humanity&#8217;s sin laid upon the spotless Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). Though no valid accusation exists, Jesus willingly submits, fulfilling <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pilate&#8217;s simple inquiry exposes an empty case against the Lord while advancing God&#8217;s flawless plan of salvation. Religious rigor without genuine righteousness drives the accusers; Roman authority unwittingly serves divine purpose. In the end, no legitimate charge can stick to the sinless Christ, yet He accepts condemnation so that all who believe might be declared righteous.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Pilate then went out unto them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Pilate therefore went out unto them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> because of their religious scruples they would not enter into the palace.<p><span class= "bld">What accusation bring ye against this man?</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/18-33.htm" title="Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?">John 18:33</a>. They expected that he would have at once ordered His execution; but he asks for the formal charge which they bring against Him. He knew by hearsay what this was, but demands the legal accusation without which the trial could not proceed. As the Roman procurator, he demands what crime Jesus has committed against the Roman law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pilate therefore</span>, because of their rooted national prejudice, <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them</span> beyond his court, to some open space convenient for hearing the case. Pilate is introduced here without any preliminary statement or title, as though the position of the man were well known to his readers - another proof that the synoptic narrative is presupposed. This scrupulousness contrasts with the summary proceeding of Herod Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2</a>), and with the conduct of the Roman authorities (<a href="/acts/22-24.htm">Acts 22:24</a>). The very question he asks implies that something had conspired to provoke a certain sympathy on his part with Jesus, and to excite additional suspicion of the Jews. The statement of <a href="/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a> may account for the former. The fact that he was ready to hear the case at this early hour shows that he must have been prepared for the scene, and even primed for it. Pilate (the manuscripts vary between <span class="accented">Peilatos</span> and <span class="accented">Pilatos</span>) was the fifth governor of Judaea under the Romans, and held office from A.D. -36. He is represented by Philo ('Legatio ad Caium,' 38) as a proud, ungovernable man; and, in his conflicts with the Jews, he had especial reason to detest their obstinate ceremonial and religious prejudices. Philo speaks of Pilate's "ferocious passions,What accusation do ye bring against this Man?</span> He may have known, probably did know, but chose to give formality to the charge, and not simply to register their decrees. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
