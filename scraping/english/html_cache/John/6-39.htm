The concept of being "sent" by God is central to Jesus' identity and mission, as seen throughout the Gospel of John (e.g., <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17, 5</a>:30). It underscores the unity and purpose within the Trinity, where Jesus acts in accordance with the Father's will. This reflects the Old Testament theme of God's sovereign plan, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where the suffering servant fulfills God's purpose.<p><b>that I shall lose none of those He has given Me</b><br>This phrase speaks to the security and assurance of salvation for believers. The imagery of not losing any reflects the shepherd motif found in <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27-29</a>, where Jesus is the Good Shepherd who protects His sheep. It also connects to the covenantal faithfulness of God, as seen in the promises made to Israel in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). The phrase "those He has given Me" indicates divine election and the Father's role in drawing people to Jesus (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>).<p><b>but raise them up at the last day</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of resurrection, a core tenet of Christian belief. The "last day" refers to the end times, a concept rooted in Jewish eschatology and further developed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). The promise of resurrection is fulfilled in Jesus' own resurrection, serving as a type and guarantee of the future resurrection for believers. This assurance is a source of hope and comfort, as it confirms the ultimate victory over death and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>- The speaker of this verse, Jesus is the Son of God, sent by the Father to accomplish His divine will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>- The one who sent Jesus, emphasizing the divine mission and authority of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples/believers.htm">The Disciples/Believers</a></b><br>- Those whom the Father has given to Jesus, representing all who believe in Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_day.htm">The Last Day</a></b><br>- Refers to the eschatological event when believers will be resurrected, highlighting the promise of eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their salvation, knowing that Jesus will not lose any of those given to Him by the Father.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_and_human_responsibility.htm">Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility</a></b><br>While God is sovereign in salvation, believers are called to live faithfully, trusting in His promise of eternal security.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_the_resurrection.htm">Hope in the Resurrection</a></b><br>The promise of being raised up on the last day provides hope and encouragement for believers facing trials and uncertainties in this life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_will_of_god.htm">The Will of God</a></b><br>Understanding that it is God's will for believers to be preserved and raised up encourages us to align our lives with His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_6_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 6:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_6_39_Eternal_security_in_Christ.htm">How does John 6:39 assure believers of eternal security in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_raise_him_up_mean.htm">What does "raise him up at the last day" signify for Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_6_39_to_John_10_28-29_promise.htm">How does John 6:39 connect with the promise in John 10:28-29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trust_God_s_will_daily_per_John_6_39.htm">How can we live daily trusting God's will as described in John 6:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_God_s_promise_John_6_39.htm">What role does faith play in fulfilling God's promise in John 6:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_6_39_God_s_will_for_salvation.htm">What does John 6:39 reveal about God's will for humanity's salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_6_39_and_eternal_security.htm">How does John 6:39 align with the concept of eternal security?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_6_39_s_impact_on_predestination.htm">What implications does John 6:39 have for the doctrine of predestination?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'raise_him_up'.htm">What did Jesus mean by "raise him up"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_stop_sinful_body_actions.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'raise him up'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_lose_salvation.htm">Is it possible for Christians to lose salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/psalm_121_3_vs._life's_hardships.htm">Psalm 121:3 &#8211;

Note on <a href="/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a>. These two verses further set forth the divine will in the mission of Christ, first in relation to the Father's gift, and then in relation to man's acceptance. Both verses make emphatic the expression of that will in the mission, <span class= "ital">Him that sent Me;</span> both refer its fulfilment to the final victory over sin and death, <span class= "ital">at the last day.</span> Both state the will of God in a single clause, prefaced by the most signal proof of divine love in God revealed on earth, and followed by its end, in man raised to heaven.<p>The "all" is here neuter, referring to the whole extent of the Messianic work. (Comp. <a href="/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>.) Vast as this is, beyond our power of thought, including all times, and all places, and all nations, and it may be other worlds, it is the divine will that nothing should be lost. In the moral, as well as in the physical world, no force can perish.<p><span class= "bld">Hath given me . . .</span>--The past tense here, because the gift is thought of in its completion at the last day.

The claim of a Divine authority and absolute power could not be put more strongly. The care with which the Divine hand can protect every fragment of his universe, and hold it by its everlasting laws and keep it in the career assigned to it from the beginning, illumines this passage. Should the speaker not sustain this stupendous assumption, it is only too certain that he was giving utterance to the most reckless raving. These words cannot be honestly watered down to the language of the influence of an ethical reformer or prophetic messenger. Jesus proceeds to clinch his argument and reassert his claims as follows. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> in proof of the very opposite of the supposition that I can drop one atom of this great charge, <span class="cmt_word">I will raise it up</span> <span class="cmt_word">at the last day.</span> Reuss applies this to the resurrection of each believer on the "last day" of each life, for he seems unwilling to find in the Fourth Gospel any such idea as that of the general resurrection. But cf. <a href="/john/5-29.htm">John 5:29</a>, and observe the repetition as in a wondrous refrain, vers. 40, 44, 54, in which he again speaks of the "last day" - the final consummation of his redemptive work. The next verse shows that the Lord did discriminate between eternal life already bestowed here and now, and the great consequence of such possession in the complete restoration of body as well as life. It is in the continuity and perpetuity of the eternal life that we find the condition of the resurrection life. The "when" of this "last day" is not positively asserted here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
