They often questioned Jesus and His followers to challenge their teachings and actions. In this context, they are investigating the miraculous healing of a man born blind, which Jesus performed on the Sabbath. This inquiry reflects their concern with maintaining religious authority and their skepticism of Jesus' divine power. The Pharisees' questioning is consistent with their role as religious leaders who were responsible for upholding Jewish law and tradition.<p><b>The man answered, &#8220;He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.&#8221;</b><br>The man's response is a straightforward account of the miracle performed by Jesus. The use of mud, made from Jesus' saliva and dirt, is significant as it echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, where God formed man from the dust of the ground. This act symbolizes Jesus' authority over creation and His role as the divine healer. The instruction to wash in the Pool of Siloam, a site with historical and ritual significance in Jerusalem, further emphasizes the connection between physical and spiritual cleansing. The man's testimony is a powerful witness to the transformative power of Jesus, aligning with other biblical accounts of healing and restoration, such as the healing of Naaman in <a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.
