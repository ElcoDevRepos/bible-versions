Jesus had been writing on the ground, a gesture that has been interpreted in various ways, possibly as a sign of contemplation or as a symbolic act. The act of straightening up signifies His readiness to address the situation directly. In the cultural context, Jesus' interaction with the woman is significant, as rabbis typically did not engage with women publicly. This action demonstrates His willingness to challenge societal norms and extend grace and dignity to those marginalized.<p><b>&#8220;Woman, where are your accusers?</b><br>The term "woman" is used respectfully, similar to how Jesus addressed His mother at the wedding in Cana (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>). This respectful address highlights Jesus' compassion and respect for the woman caught in adultery. The question "where are your accusers?" points to the absence of those who sought to condemn her, emphasizing the failure of the accusers to uphold the law they were so eager to enforce. This moment reflects the fulfillment of the law through grace, as Jesus embodies the perfect balance of justice and mercy.<p><b>Has no one condemned you?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores the theme of judgment and forgiveness. In the Jewish legal system, at least two witnesses were required to condemn someone (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The absence of accusers means there is no legal basis for condemnation. This moment foreshadows the ultimate judgment and forgiveness found in Christ, who offers redemption and freedom from sin. It also connects to <a href="/romans/8.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, which states, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." Jesus' question invites the woman to recognize her new standing, free from the condemnation of the law, and to embrace a life transformed by grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as compassionate and wise, challenging the accusers and offering grace to the woman caught in adultery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_caught_in_adultery.htm">The Woman Caught in Adultery</a></b><br>She is brought before Jesus by the scribes and Pharisees, accused of adultery, and facing condemnation according to the Law of Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who attempt to trap Jesus by bringing the woman to Him, testing His adherence to the Law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_courts.htm">The Temple Courts</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a public place where Jesus was teaching, and where the confrontation takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_accusers.htm">The Accusers</a></b><br>Those who brought the woman to Jesus, intending to stone her according to the law, but who leave one by one after Jesus' challenge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/grace_over_judgment.htm">Grace Over Judgment</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies grace, showing that while the law condemns, He offers forgiveness and a new start.

"Of all who brought the charge against thee, was there not one to condemn thee?" The question is put to her to lead to thoughts of her sin.

The question (with or without the additions) implied that our Lord had not seen the obvious effect of his words upon the accusing party. There was no triumph in his eye, no flush of victory over his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Hath no one condemned thee?</span> pronounced upon thee the sentence of condemnation? Has no one declared that thine is a case of stoning? - <span class="accented">No one?</span> Then the judgment has yet to be uttered, if it be left with him.

A time is coming when the Father would commit all judgment into his hands - when his awful word, "I know you not," or "Depart from <span class="accented">me</span>," will be the signal of doom. But now his mission is to heal, not to wound; to comfort, not to punish; to reveal the heart of God, not to execute the crude judgments of men; to soothe, not to stone. He does not say, "Be of good courage; thy sins are forgiven." he does not say, "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; Her faith hath saved her;" but, <span class="cmt_word">Go, and henceforth sin no more.</span> He justifies the position that he will not quench the smoking flax nor break the bruised reed. He condemns the sin, but for a while spares the sinner. He refuses to set up his judgment against Moses, or take into his human hands the administration of civil or political law. He does not say, "Go in peace," or "Go to peace;" but from this moment, this awful "now" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), "sin no more." The reticence and abruptness of the narrator are not like the style of apocryphal writers. Such a narrative could not have been invented by the second-century disciples, by docetic Ebionites, by the ordinary fabricators of apocryphal literature. If the text is so varied, conflicting, and ill-sustained as to envelop it in doubt; if the place in the gospel narrative be uncertain; if the use of a few words suggests a non-Johannine source; and if the position between <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a> and John 8:12 be difficult to accept; - there is yet nothing inconsistent with the Johannine teaching, or the sublime and unapproachable originality of the character of the Johannine Christ. The narrative will remain for all time an illustration of the blending of judgment with mercy, which has received its highest expression in the life work and Person of the Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">straightened up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#973;&#968;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anakypsas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_352.htm">Strong's 352: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise myself, look up, be elated.
