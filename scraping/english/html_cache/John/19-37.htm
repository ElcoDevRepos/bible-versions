The author often highlights how Jesus' life and death fulfill the Hebrew Scriptures, underscoring the continuity between the Old and New Testaments. This particular reference points to the prophetic nature of Jesus' crucifixion, emphasizing that it was not a random event but part of God's divine plan.<p><b>&#8220;They will look on the One they have pierced.&#8221;</b><br>This is a direct reference to <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which speaks of a future time when the inhabitants of Jerusalem will mourn for the one they have pierced. In its original context, this prophecy is about the restoration and repentance of Israel. In the New Testament, it is applied to Jesus, highlighting His role as the suffering Messiah. The piercing refers to the crucifixion, where Jesus' side was pierced by a Roman soldier's spear (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>). This act fulfills the prophecy and signifies the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, even by those who initially rejected Him. The imagery of looking upon the pierced one also suggests a future acknowledgment and repentance, pointing to eschatological themes where all will recognize Jesus' true identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this verse, Jesus is the one who is pierced.

Every detail underscores that Scripture is accurate, literal, and fully trustworthy, revealing Jesus as the promised, pierced Redeemer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span>--The words, as they occur in the Authorised version, of the prophecy are, "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced," but the reading which St. John has followed is that of many MSS., and is adopted by many Rabbinic (as Rashi and Kimchi) and many modern authorities (as Ewald and Geiger). The Greek translation (LXX.) of the prophet avoided the strong word "pierced," as applied to Jehovah, and substituted for it "insulted." St. John translates the original Hebrew freely for himself (comp. <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>), and gives the undoubted meaning of the Hebrew word, translating it by the same Greek word which is used by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus. He thinks of the prophecy which spoke of Jehovah as pierced by His people, and sees it fulfilled in the Messiah pierced on the cross.<p>For the fulfilment of the prophecy, comp. Notes on <a href="/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>. Jewish Rabbis, and Greek proselytes, and Roman soldiers alike looked, as they stood before the cross, on Him whom they pierced. That scene is typical. He shall draw all men unto Him, and the moral power over the heart of humanity will be the heart of love, which loves and therefore saves him that has pierced it through and through. "God commendeth His love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And again another Scripture saith</span>. The second of the Old Testament quotations is in several ways important and noteworthy. <span class="cmt_word">They shall look on him whom they pierced</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The original passage is (<a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "They shall look upon me whom they pierced." The evangelist altered the ME into HIM, which, as it stands in the old oracle, and regarded as the language of Jehovah, is sufficiently surprising. The LXX. had felt the difficulty, and translated it <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "They shall look towards me, because they have insulted me." Their repentance and misgiving shall be aroused, because in response for those things which they have done contemptuously against me. It is interesting to see that John is more accurate in his Greek translation of this prophetic passage, viz. <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span>, "They shall look" with love and grace and repentance "on him whom (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) they pierced." This Greek rendering of the Hebrew is followed by Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, and is quoted by Justin Martyr; it is also found in <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, forming a link of connection between the Gospel and the Apocalypse. Moreover, it is most impressive to find that the awful tragedy does not close even in the hands of this writer without a word of promise and hope. <a href="/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8-14</a> is clearly in the mind of the apostle. The merciful Lord waits for the repentance of Israel, of those who, by instigating Roman power for his destruction, pierced him by their trenchant ingratitude as well as by the Roman spear. It will be fulfilled more completely when every eye shall see him, and the full revelation of his majesty shall smite the whole world with penitence or despair.
