In the Gospel of John, Jesus frequently refers to His unique connection with the Father, highlighting His role as the Son of God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>). The phrase "in the presence of the Father" suggests a direct and personal experience, underscoring the authenticity and truth of His teachings. This aligns with the concept of Jesus as the Logos, the Word made flesh, who reveals the Father to humanity (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>). The imagery of seeing and speaking indicates a prophetic role, similar to Old Testament prophets who conveyed God's messages, but with greater authority as Jesus is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and you do what you have heard from your father.</b><br>Here, Jesus contrasts His divine origin and authority with the spiritual state of His audience. The "you" refers to the Jewish leaders and those opposing Him, who claim Abraham as their father (<a href="/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>). However, Jesus challenges their claim by pointing out their actions, which do not align with Abraham's faith and obedience. The phrase "your father" is later clarified as referring to the devil (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), indicating a spiritual lineage based on actions and beliefs rather than mere ancestry. This highlights the theme of spiritual paternity and the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will, as true children of God are those who follow His teachings (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14-17</a>). The contrast between Jesus' divine mission and the audience's earthly focus underscores the broader Johannine theme of light versus darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders and contrasting His divine origin and authority with their earthly understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, with whom Jesus has a unique and intimate relationship, having seen and known Him directly.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience Jesus is addressing, who are often in conflict with Him throughout the Gospel of John.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_concept_of_fatherhood.htm">The Concept of Fatherhood</a></b><br>Jesus contrasts His Father, God, with the "father" of the Jewish leaders, implying a spiritual lineage and influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This conversation takes place in Jerusalem, likely in the temple courts, during one of Jesus' public teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_and_witness.htm">Divine Authority and Witness</a></b><br>Jesus speaks with authority because He has seen and knows the Father.

Jesus, the eternal Son, speaks only what He has personally seen in intimate communion with the Father, guaranteeing absolute truth. His opponents act on second-hand distortions received from a different father, the devil, and their deeds expose that lineage. The verse calls every reader to examine whose voice shapes their beliefs and whose character their actions reflect, urging wholehearted alignment with the Son who perfectly reveals the Father.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">I speak that which I have seen with</span> <span class= "bld">my Father.</span>--Some of the older MSS. read "the" for "My," but without change of sense. For the thought, comp. <a href="/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>, where we have the same connection between doing and speaking. He is the Word, and His work is to speak what He had seen in His eternal existence with the Father.<p><span class= "bld">And ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span>--For "seen," the better reading is probably <span class= "ital">heard.</span> Here, as in the previous clause, some MSS. omit the possessive pronoun with "father," but it is rightly inserted to express the meaning. The clauses are in direct opposition to each other, and this is shown by the emphatic personal pronouns--"I, on My part . . . My Father." "You, on your part . . . your father." The tenses of the verbs, too, are to be distinguished--"That which I have seen" (during My whole existence in eternity). "That which ye heard" (when ye became servants of sin). The cases of the substantives are also different--"I have seen with my Father" (signifying existence with. Comp. <a href="/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). "Ye heard from your father" (what he directed).<p>Again, there is a word in the original which it is hard to represent in English, and which our version altogether omits. It is not simply "and ye do," but "and ye therefore, or accordingly, do." It is the same principle of union between Father and Son which directs His work, which is to reveal God, and their work, of which the seeking to kill Him is an instance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I speak the things</span> <span class="cmt_word">which I have seen with the (</span><span class="accented">my<span class="cmt_word"></span>) Father:</span> <span class="cmt_word">and do you therefore the things which ye heard</span> <span class="cmt_word">from the</span> (<span class="accented">your</span>) <span class="cmt_word">father;</span> or, <span class="accented">and you therefore do the things which ye heard from your father.</span> We need not, with Meyer, limit the Lord's vision of the Divine things which he saw with the Father to his premundane Personality. He describes himself in constant communion with the Father. The Father is with him. He knows the mind and will and good pleasure of the Father. His is the perfectly pure heart, which is as an eye forevermore beholding the Father. That the Only Begotten sees and knows what no other sees, is constantly taught in this Gospel (see <a href="/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46</a>). In Christ, moreover, the disciple may verily see the Father (<a href="/john/14-7.htm">John 14:7, 9</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-23.htm">1 John 2:23</a>). The probable textual reading given above would draw a species of contrast between Christ's "seeing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) with the Father, and the Jews' "hearing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) from the Father, as though such communication were less intimate than "seeing." This must not be pressed (see ver. 40). If the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> be imperative, the language would be an appeal to the Jews to act out that which, from prophets and teachers and interpreters of the Divine will, they had heard. Moulton treats the clause as one more, one last, exhortation. The word of Christ had not advanced within them - it remained as a barren formula; let them give it free course now. Their opposition had not as yet been malignant or hopeless; one more chance is given them. The more ordinary interpretation is to make the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> indicative. If it be so, and still more if the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (omitted by B, L, P) be genuine, "the father" to whom reference is made as theirs, is in contrast with the Father of Christ, and, without pointedly saying so, Jesus implies that it is another father altogether. In ver. 44 Christ does indeed declare that the father with whom they are in ethical relation and sympathy is not God, but the devil - the very opposite of the God of Abraham, the very antithesis of the Father of infinite love. At this point he simply suggests, "Therefore the things which ye heard from your father ye do," ye habitually do, ye are now doing in your hatred and murderous sentiments towards myself. Surely this implies a severity which is hardly compatible with an address to Jews who believed him. The interpretation of the following verse is governed by that of this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I speak</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#955;&#8182;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of what</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7939;</span> <span class="translit">(ha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
