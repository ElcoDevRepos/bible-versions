This reflects His mission of redemption rather than condemnation, aligning with <a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, where Jesus states He came not to condemn the world but to save it. The context here is a legal metaphor, common in Jewish thought, where God is the ultimate judge. Jesus distances Himself from the role of a prosecutor, highlighting His intercessory role as seen in 1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>, where He is described as an advocate with the Father.<p><b>Your accuser is Moses,</b><br>Moses is a central figure in Jewish history, representing the Law given to Israel. By stating that Moses is their accuser, Jesus points to the Law itself as the standard by which they are judged. This is significant because the Jewish leaders prided themselves on their adherence to the Mosaic Law. In <a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26-27</a>, Moses himself warns that the Law will testify against Israel if they fail to keep it. This underscores the idea that the Law, which they rely on for righteousness, actually reveals their shortcomings.<p><b>in whom you have put your hope.</b><br>The Jewish leaders placed their hope in the Law of Moses for their salvation and identity as God's chosen people. This reflects a common belief of the time that adherence to the Law was the path to righteousness. However, Jesus challenges this notion by suggesting that their hope is misplaced if it is not ultimately in Him. This echoes Paul's argument in <a href="/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a>, where Christ is described as the culmination of the Law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

He had come from the Father, and it might have seemed to follow from what He said, that He would accuse them to the Father. He guards against this misinterpretation. Love cannot accuse; He cannot be an accuser. He is ever a judge, only because love must judge hatred, and light must judge darkness, by revealing it. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>.) And yet the very revelation of love and light condemns hatred and darkness. The heart, then, needs no accuser, for it accuses itself; it needs no sentence, for it condemns itself. There is no penalty so fearful as that of the soul which is awakened to its own sin, and cannot itself forgive that sin, and, therefore, cannot receive the forgiveness of the Infinite Love, which always forgives. Their accusation was their rejection of light and love in the past, and Moses was their accuser. This is the thought of the following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Think not,</span> he added, with one concluding and sweeping exposition of their relation to the old covenant and to himself - <span class="cmt_word">Think not</span>, as ye might be disposed to do, <span class="cmt_word">that I will accuse you to</span> (<span class="accented">before</span>; see Syriac <span class="accented">k'dom</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Father</span> (not referring to the judgment day, where he will appear as Judge, but now), as One in intimate and awful relation with the Father, or as One whose words have set up a standard which is much loftier or severer than that which you are prepared to allow. He has charged them already with having missed the deepest teaching of their own Scriptures, with fastening on the letter rather than on the spirit of the Divine Word; that, though the prima article of t heir creed was the doctrine of "the only God," they had no love of God, no appreciation of God as the only Source of worthy glory, and therefore neither faith nor knowledge. They were snapping up worthless pretenders, and drinking the flattery of men rather than the approval of God. They were blind to the glory and deaf to the voice of the Father, and so would not come to him for life.
