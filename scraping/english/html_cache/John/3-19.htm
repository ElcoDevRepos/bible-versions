In the context of John's Gospel, it follows Jesus' discourse with Nicodemus, highlighting the spiritual truths revealed by Christ. The term "verdict" suggests a divine judgment, reflecting the ultimate truth about humanity's response to Jesus.<p><b>The Light has come into the world:</b><br>"Light" is a recurring metaphor in John's Gospel, symbolizing Jesus as the revelation of God's truth and presence. This echoes the prologue of John (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-9</a>), where Jesus is described as the true Light that gives light to everyone. The coming of the Light signifies the incarnation of Christ, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining on those living in darkness.<p><b>but men loved the darkness rather than the Light:</b><br>This phrase highlights the human tendency to reject divine truth. "Darkness" represents sin, ignorance, and separation from God. The preference for darkness over light underscores the moral and spiritual blindness of humanity. This theme is consistent with the biblical narrative of human rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man.<p><b>because their deeds were evil:</b><br>The reason for humanity's preference for darkness is attributed to their evil actions. This reflects the biblical teaching that sin corrupts human nature and inclines people away from God. The concept of evil deeds is prevalent throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for repentance and redemption. This phrase also connects to <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, underscoring the universal need for salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "The Light" in this passage, Jesus is the central figure who brings truth and salvation into the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents humanity and the earthly realm into which Jesus, the Light, has come.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Symbolizes humanity, particularly those who reject the Light due to their preference for darkness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Represents sin, evil deeds, and the rejection of divine truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_verdict.htm">The Verdict</a></b><br>The judgment or conclusion that humanity's preference for darkness over Light reveals their sinful nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_light_and_darkness.htm">The Nature of Light and Darkness</a></b><br>Jesus is the Light that reveals truth and exposes sin.

The light makes the darkness visible. Both were before men. That they chose darkness was the act of their own will, and this act of the will was determined by the evil of their deeds. "The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>.)<p>The words are general, but they must have had, for him who then heard them, a special force. It was night. He had avoided the light of day, and like men who go forth to deeds of darkness under cover of darkness, he had come in secrecy to Jesus. His own conscience told him that he was in the presence of a Teacher sent from God (<a href="/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>); but he has checked the voice of conscience.

This crisis, in the case of the believer, furnishes a clear and illustrious proof that the Son of God had primarily come to save, not to judge; while in the case of the unbeliever it was sufficiently manifested by the absence of faith in that which was so sublimely adapted to induce affectionate reverence and adoring trust. <span class="cmt_word">Now this is the judgment.</span> The peculiar form of the sentence, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, is found elsewhere in John (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11, 14</a>). We are here reminded of the words of the prologue (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5, 9</a>, see notes), where the original shining of the Light in the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (the abiding state of darkness) ended in non-reception, non-perception of the Light. Subsequently it is said that the light - the archetypal light which illumines, shines upon, every man who comes into the world - came, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in a new and more impressive manner, and by its coming, originated a process of judgment and discrimination among men. This utterance of the prologue is here shown to depend upon the words of the only begotten Son of God made flesh. The critical school make this correspondence with the prologue and with Johannine thought incontestable evidence that we have here John's meditation rather than the word of Jesus. There is, of course, an alternative interpretation. But it appears to us that it is equally rational and critical to see in the words of Jesus thus reported, the origin of the prologue. <span class="cmt_word">Light has come into the world, and</span> made evident and established the awful fact that men loved (aorist, denoting a defined characteristic) <span class="cmt_word">the darkness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, used here and <a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a> for absolute darkness, the complete contradictory of the light), <span class="cmt_word">rather than the light.</span> Lucke has urged that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> here might mean <span class="accented">magis</span>, not <span class="accented">potius</span>, and that the Lord admits a certain amount of love for the light, though less than that for the darkness; but numerous passages of similar construction make it certain that <span class="accented">potius</span>, not <span class="accented">magis</span>, is the meaning (cf. <a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>; <a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-4.htm">2 Timothy 3:4</a>). "The light," though so needed, and so lovely in itself, was not loved by men. It brought consequences from which "men" recoiled and revolted. They loved their own ignorance and peril. They shrank from the demands - from the repentance, the transformation of habit and character, the utter moral revolution that must be consequent upon the reception of the light. Darkness was loved, hailed, accepted, rested in. The process of the judgment was conspicuous in demonstrating this unholy love. If a man love the deformed, the misshapen, the defiled, and the corrupt thing, rather than the truly beautiful, this is a judgment passed upon his entire previous life and on his present character, which is the outcome and upshot of the life. If a man love sensual gratification, its objects and its means, rather than virtue and chastity and serene and sacred purity, this is in itself a terrific <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - the announcement of his previous career of dissipation and folly. If a man love the darkness of unrenewed humanity rather than the uncreated light embodied, this is his <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the process by which it is made evident is the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> passing over him. The explanatory clause that follows gives great force to the previous assertion: For their works were evil. Their habitual conduct supplies permanence and energy to their perverse "love," and reveals its historical antecedent - their works (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) were "evil" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>). The <span class="accented">love</span> of darkness was the consequence of their wicked <span class="accented">ways.</span> The judgment of eternal law has fallen upon their violation of it. The great penalty of sin is sinful desire. A bias towards evil is originated and confirmes by sinful compliance.
