The illustration refers to the parable of the Good Shepherd, which is a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through everyday imagery. Shepherding was a familiar occupation in ancient Israel, and the imagery of sheep and shepherds is prevalent throughout the Bible, symbolizing the relationship between God and His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>). Jesus often used parables to reveal truths to those who were open to understanding while concealing them from those who were not receptive (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>).<p><b>but they did not understand</b><br>The lack of understanding among Jesus' audience, particularly the Pharisees, highlights their spiritual blindness and inability to grasp the deeper truths of His message. This theme of misunderstanding is recurrent in the Gospels, where Jesus' teachings are often met with confusion or rejection by those who are spiritually hardened or self-righteous (<a href="/john/8-43.htm">John 8:43</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). The inability to understand is not due to the complexity of the message but rather the condition of the heart.<p><b>what He was telling them</b><br>Jesus' message in this passage is about His identity as the Good Shepherd and the implications of that role. He is contrasting Himself with false shepherds, or leaders, who do not genuinely care for the sheep (<a href="/john/10.htm">John 10:1-5</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>). The illustration is a revelation of His divine mission and His sacrificial love for His followers. The failure to comprehend what Jesus was telling them underscores the broader rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders, who were unable to see Him as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (Isaiah 53, <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching using a parable or illustration.

The discourse of this chapter differs from the true parable, which is a story in which the outer facts are kept wholly distinct from the ideal truths that are to be taught; whereas here the form and the idea interpenetrate each other at every point. It is so in the other so-called "parable" in this Gospel (John 15). Strictly speaking, neither the "Good Shepherd" nor the "True Vine" is a parable. Both are "allegories," or rather, they are, as there is every reason to think, allegorical interpretations of actual events in the material world, which are thus made the vehicle of spiritual truths. It will follow from this that the interpretation of every point in the history of the material facts (<span class= "ital">e.g., "</span>the porter" in <a href="/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>) is not always to be pressed. In the parable the story is made to express the spiritual truth, and with greater or lesser fulness every point in it may have its spiritual counterpart. The outer facts which are allegorised exist independently of the spiritual truth. The fact that they express it at some central points is all that is necessary for the allegory, and greater caution should attend the use of any addition to the interpretation which is given. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This parable spake Jesus unto them</span>.

The Pharisees were conscious of neither need, nor blindness, nor desire of salvation, nor of the Shepherd's care or grace. They will not go to him for life. They can make nothing of his enigmatic words. They take counsel against him. Their misconception contrasts strongly with the susceptibility of the broken-hearted penitents. So far the parable or proverb corresponds with the parables of the kingdom in the synoptic Gospels, and is open to many interpretations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
