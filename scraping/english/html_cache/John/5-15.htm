It reflects a sense of urgency and purpose. In the context of the narrative, the man had been healed after 38 years of infirmity, which would naturally lead to a desire to share the news. This action also demonstrates the man's obedience to Jesus' command to "get up, pick up your mat, and walk."<p><b>and told the Jews</b><br>The term "the Jews" in the Gospel of John often refers to the Jewish leaders or authorities, rather than the Jewish people as a whole. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time. The man&#8217;s decision to inform them may have been motivated by a sense of duty or fear, as the Jewish leaders were known to enforce strict adherence to the Sabbath laws.<p><b>that it was Jesus</b><br>Identifying Jesus as the one who healed him is significant. It highlights Jesus' authority and power to perform miracles, which is a central theme in the Gospel of John. This identification also sets the stage for the growing conflict between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, as they were increasingly concerned about His influence and the claims He made about His identity.<p><b>who had made him well</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miraculous nature of the healing. The man had been an invalid for a long time, and his restoration to health was a testament to Jesus' divine power. This act of healing is one of the signs in John's Gospel that point to Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming of a healer and restorer, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the blind seeing and the lame walking.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>A man who had been an invalid for 38 years, healed by Jesus at the Pool of Bethesda.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The Son of God, who performed the miracle of healing the invalid on the Sabbath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were concerned with the observance of the Sabbath laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pool_of_bethesda.htm">Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem where many disabled people gathered, hoping for healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>Jesus heals the man on the Sabbath, which leads to a confrontation with the Jewish leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>Jesus challenges the legalistic interpretation of the Sabbath, emphasizing mercy and compassion over ritual.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_to_others.htm">Witnessing to Others</a></b><br>The healed man testifies to the Jews about Jesus, showing the importance of sharing our encounters with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus'_authority.htm">Recognizing Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His authority over physical ailments and religious traditions, affirming His divine nature.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_criticism.htm">Responding to Criticism</a></b><br>Jesus' actions invite criticism from religious leaders, teaching us to stand firm in our faith despite opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith.htm">The Role of Faith</a></b><br>The man's healing was initiated by Jesus, but his response in faith led to his testimony, highlighting the importance of faith in action.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_15_Testify_about_Jesus.htm">How does John 5:15 encourage us to testify about Jesus in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Healed_man_s_view_on_Jesus_identity.htm">What does the healed man's testimony reveal about his understanding of Jesus' identity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_boldly_share_faith_today.htm">How can we apply the man's boldness in sharing our faith today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_parallels_to_John_5_15.htm">What Old Testament examples parallel the man's witness in John 5:15?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_5_15_inspire_public_faith.htm">How does John 5:15 challenge us to acknowledge God's work publicly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_5_15_Jesus_miracle_power.htm">How does John 5:15 demonstrate the power of Jesus' miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_report_Jesus_to_leaders_in_John_5_15.htm">Why did the healed man report Jesus to the Jewish leaders in John 5:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_5_15_Jesus_vs_Jewish_authorities.htm">What does John 5:15 reveal about the relationship between Jesus and the Jewish authorities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_do_you_say_i_am.htm">Who do you say I am?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'nothing_is_impossible_with_god'_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 'One New Man'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_abolish_the_law.htm">Did Jesus come to abolish the law?

The narrative places emphasis on obedience in motion, much like the leper who &#8220;went out and began to proclaim it freely&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-45.htm">Mark 1:45</a>).<p>- His departure underscores genuine transformation: people who truly encounter the Lord seldom remain where they were (cf. <a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>).<p>- John&#8217;s wording signals a literal, historical moment&#8212;this was no allegory; a real man physically walked away after thirty-eight years of infirmity (<a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told the Jews</b><p>- The man specifically approaches the religious leaders, the recognized authorities. Similar patterns appear when the blind man&#8217;s neighbors take him to the Pharisees (<a href="/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>).<p>- His report creates accountability. Truth must be declared to those tasked with guarding it (cf. <a href="/acts/4-5.htm">Acts 4:5-10</a>).<p>- Scripture presents no hint of malice in his disclosure; rather, it reflects simple testimony&#8212;he is stating fact to people who need to hear it, just as the Samaritan woman did in <a href="/john/4-29.htm">John 4:29</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that it was Jesus</b><p>- He identifies the Healer by name, moving from vague gratitude to explicit confession. &#8220;Everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).<p>- The naming of Jesus draws a line: credit belongs to Christ alone, not to superstition surrounding the pool (<a href="/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>) nor to the man&#8217;s own effort.<p>- This bold attribution foreshadows the escalating tension between Jesus and the religious establishment (<a href="/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16-18</a>), mirroring later confrontations in <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> and <a href="/john/10-24.htm">John 10:24-25</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had made him well</b><p>- The clause reaffirms the miracle&#8217;s authenticity and permanence. &#8220;Made well&#8221; describes complete restoration, echoing <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, &#8220;Then the lame will leap like a deer.&#8221;<p>- Physical healing acts as a visible sign of deeper spiritual authority. Jesus declares later in the chapter, &#8220;The Son gives life to whom He wishes&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>), linking the man&#8217;s restored legs to the promise of resurrection life.<p>- Here, the testimony transitions from event to evangelism: the healed man becomes a living witness that &#8220;the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish&#8230; testify about Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-15.htm">John 5:15</a> shows a once-crippled man immediately stepping into witness. His movement demonstrates genuine change, his report brings truth to authority, his naming of Jesus directs glory to the Savior, and his testimony of healing confirms Christ&#8217;s divine power. The verse teaches that those touched by Jesus are called to speak plainly, give credit fully, and live as evidence that the Messiah truly makes people whole.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The man departed, and told the Jews.</span>--We are not told what reason underlay his report to the Jews. It is natural that he should give the answer which he could not give before (<a href="/john/5-13.htm" title="And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.">John 5:13</a>), and that he should wish to secure himself from the charge of Sabbath-breaking by supplying his authority. The narrative does not suggest that he did this in a tone of defiance, which has been found here from a remembrance of John 9, still less that he used his new strength immediately to bring a charge against the Giver of it. The impression is rather, that he felt that this power came from a prophet sent by God, and that he told this to those who were God's representatives to the nation, supposing that they would recognise Him too.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The man departed, and told</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus,</span> (<span class="accented">and sought to slay him</span> ), <span class="cmt_word">because he was doing these things on the sabbath.</span> The motive of the man may have been one of gratitude, or may have arisen from a sense of duty, seeing that he had not answered the question of the Jews, and had been himself charged with doing the unlawful thing (Weiss). He <span class="accented">may</span> have sought to win from his interlocutors some reverence for his Healer; but everything points the other way. He was a loveless being; he seems to have been nettled by the charge and warning he had just received, and went with the name of his Benefactor on his lips to those who in his hearing had already condemned the Saviour's conduct. The connection is close between the two facts, viz. the man's eager implication of his Healer in the responsibility of his own act, which was said by "the Jews" to be unlawful; and the course of cruel persecution and deadly hate which was there and then inaugurated against the Saviour of the world. The sixteenth verse represents a course of conduct on the part of the Jews which led to open conflict with the dominant party. Christ's view of the sabbath lay, indeed, in the heart of the old Law, and was even recognized by some of the wisest and noblest spirits of Judaism; but it ran counter to the current traditionary interpretation, and cut as with a sharp sabre through the knots and entanglement of the schools. It was the unpardonable sin that ideas and rules which sustained and fed the authority of the hierarchical party should be swept away as valueless and perilous accumulations, and as fungoid encrustations upon the Law of Moses. Weiss justly remarks that there is no colour for the charge that the fourth evangelist antedated the sabbath controversy, for Mark (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>) shows that it had already commenced in Galilee. In <a href="/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1-3</a> we see that the Pharisaic party distrusted Jesus; here we see that the authorities are in arms against him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
