In the context of <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, Jesus is engaged in a heated dialogue with these leaders, challenging their understanding of the law and their spiritual blindness. The term "Jews" in the Gospel of John frequently refers to the religious authorities rather than the Jewish people as a whole. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the established religious order of the time.<p><b>&#8220;Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan</b><br>The accusation of being a Samaritan was a significant insult in the Jewish context. Samaritans were considered heretical and ethnically impure by the Jews due to their mixed heritage and differing religious practices. This reflects the deep-seated animosity between Jews and Samaritans, which dates back to the Assyrian conquest and the subsequent intermarriage of Israelites with foreign settlers. By calling Jesus a Samaritan, the Jewish leaders are attempting to discredit Him and His teachings, associating Him with a group they viewed as outside the covenant community.<p><b>and You have a demon?&#8221;</b><br>Accusing Jesus of having a demon was a way to dismiss His authority and the divine nature of His mission. In the cultural and religious context of the time, attributing someone's actions or words to demonic influence was a serious charge, implying that they were not only wrong but spiritually corrupt. This accusation is a continuation of the theme in the Gospels where Jesus is misunderstood and rejected by the religious leaders. It also echoes earlier instances in the Gospels where Jesus is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (e.g., <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>).

The verse exposes the tragic reality that when confronted with undeniable truth, unrepentant hearts may choose slander over surrender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(48) <span class= "bld">Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span>--The words imply that the saying was customary among the Pharisees. The knowledge of this, and the simple way in which the fact is told, is one of many instances of the writer's minute acquaintance with what was said and done by the leaders of the Jerusalem party. There is no instance given of the term "Samaritan" being applied to our Lord, but the term itself is frequently used by the Rabbis as one of opprobrium. The history of the fourth chapter is at once suggested to our minds, and was probably not absent from theirs. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>.) There may have been facts more immediately connected with this very Feast of Tabernacles present to their minds, which are unknown to us. The going up secretly of <a href="/john/7-10.htm" title="But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.">John 7:10</a>, must almost certainly have been through Samaria. He had kept the last Passover in the despised Galilee (<a href="/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>). Had He kept Tabernacles in the hated Samaria? It is worth noting that the word Samaritan, in the singular, as applied to an individual, occurs but twice, except here and in John 4. One instance is in the parable spoken at no long interval after the present discourse (<a href="/context/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25-37</a>). The other tells us that the only one of the ten lepers who turned back to glorify God "was a Samaritan" (<a href="/luke/17-16.htm" title="And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.">Luke 17:16</a>).<p>The rendering, "and hast a devil," is one which, probably, cannot now be improved. Wiclif's word here is "fiend," which in this sense is obsolete. But every reader of the Greek must feel how little our English word can represent the two distinct ideas, represented by two distinct words here and in <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>. "Demon," used originally for the lower divinities, and not unfrequently for the gods, passed in the Scriptures, which taught the knowledge of the true God, into the sense of an evil spirit. Thus the word which could represent the attendant genius of Socrates came to express what we speak of as demoniacal possession, and the supposed power of witchcraft and sorcery. Socrates is made to say, "For this reason, therefore, rather than for any other, he calls them demons, because they were prudent and knowing" (<span class= "ital">da?mones,</span> Plato, <span class= "ital">Cratylus,</span> xxiii.). The history of Simon Magus reminds us that the people of Samaria, from the least to the greatest, had been for a long time under the influence of his sorceries (<a href="/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and it is probable that there is a special connection in the words here, "Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon." (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus III. on Notes to St. Matthew's Gospel,</span> p. 185.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - But it brought from them a shout of derision and a burst of scornful mockery. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a daemon?</span> They imagine that the bare charge that they, the leaders of Israel, are "not of God," and that they reveal the fact by their inability to hear the words of God then sounding in their ears, was flat heresy, a gross lack of patriotism, and proved that, in his lofty self-assertion, he was no better than a Samaritan - the most hated of their neighbours. They return a harsh <span class="accented">tu-quoque</span> to our Lord's refusal to admit their Abrahamic descent, and his condemnation of their utter moral dissimilarity from their putative father. The sentence, "a Samaritan art thou!" is singularly insulting in its tone and form. We cannot measure the exact amount of insult they condensed into this word, whether it be of heresy, or alienation from Israel, or accusation of impure descent. It is remarkable that our Lord had shown special kindness to Samaritans (ch. 4.), and had made in his parable "the good Samaritan" the type of neighbourly love; but these very Jews had, in the height of this controversy, accused him of being a "Galilaean," and it is not probable that they used the term otherwise than as a soubriquet of scorn. Edersheim (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, 2:174, 175) would translate into Aramaic the language here cited, and finds in its form <span class="accented">Shomroni</span> the real interpretation of its meaning. <span class="accented">Shomron</span> is, according to him, used in rabbinical writing for <span class="accented">Ashmedai</span>, and in the cabbalists is used for <span class="accented">Sammael</span> or <span class="accented">Satan.</span> Arabian traditions are brought in to confirm this interpretation of the speech, which he regards as equivalent to "Thou art a child of the devil," thus retorting upon Jesus the charge that they were doing the works of <span class="accented">their</span> father, the devil. The one expression is thought by Edersheim equivalent to that which follows, <span class="accented">thou hast a daemon</span>; and his explanation is thought to cover our Lord's silence respecting it. In our opinion this is far-fetched and unnatural. Christ's silence is better justified by his refusal to regard such a term as conveying opprobrium, tic had risen above the distinction of race, and could afford to despise the taunt. In <a href="/john/7-20.htm">John 7:20</a> (see note) a similar charge had been made by the angry Jews. The Lord is accused of being mastered by some daemon, who is perverting his mind and confusing his speech. Some further force is added to the charge from the language of the Talmud, 'Jebamoth,' fol. 47, <span class="accented">a</span>: "R. Nachman, son of Isaac, said to a Samaritan, 'Thou art a Cuthite, and testimony from thy mouth has no validity.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
