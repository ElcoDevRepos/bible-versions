The large crowd signifies Jesus' growing popularity and the people's desire to witness His miracles and hear His teachings. This scene sets the stage for the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, which is the only miracle recorded in all four Gospels, highlighting its significance. The crowd's approach reflects the human need for spiritual and physical sustenance, which Jesus is about to address.<p><b>He said to Philip</b><br>Philip, one of the twelve apostles, was from Bethsaida, a town near the Sea of Galilee. Jesus' choice to address Philip may be due to Philip's familiarity with the area, suggesting he might know where to obtain food. This interaction also serves as a test of faith for Philip, as Jesus often used questions to teach and challenge His disciples. Philip's response will reveal his understanding of Jesus' power and provision.<p><b>Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?</b><br>This question highlights the practical concern of providing for the physical needs of the crowd. It also sets the stage for demonstrating Jesus' divine ability to provide abundantly. The mention of bread is significant, as it is a staple food in the ancient Near East and symbolizes sustenance and life. This question foreshadows the miraculous provision that will follow and points to Jesus as the Bread of Life, a theme further developed in <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. The question also echoes the Old Testament provision of manna in the wilderness, drawing a parallel between Moses and Jesus as providers for God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, known for his practical mindset and often mentioned in contexts where Jesus tests or teaches His disciples.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_crowd.htm">The Great Crowd</a></b><br>A multitude of people who followed Jesus, drawn by His teachings and miracles, particularly His healing of the sick.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This event takes place near the Sea of Galilee, a significant location for Jesus' ministry, where He performed many miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>The feeding of the 5,000, a miracle that demonstrates Jesus' compassion and divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>Jesus' question to Philip highlights the human impossibility of the task, setting the stage for a demonstration of divine provision.

Compare the same compassionate gaze in <a href="/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a> and <a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>, where He &#8220;felt compassion&#8221; and healed and taught.<p>&#8226; John has already noted that &#8220;a large crowd was following Him, because they saw the signs He was performing&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2</a>).

The test is not for information but for formation&#8212;growing Philip&#8217;s trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>c).<p>&#8226; The question highlights the impossibility of human solutions. Philip&#8217;s later calculation of two hundred denarii (<a href="/john/6-7.htm">John 6:7</a>) proves the point.<p>&#8226; It echoes Old Testament scenes where God provides food in barren places:<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>,15&#8212;manna in the wilderness.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19&#8211;25</a>&#8212;&#8220;Can God spread a table in the wilderness?&#8221; Yes, He can.<p>&#8211; <a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42&#8211;44</a>&#8212;Elisha feeds a hundred men with twenty loaves, a foreshadowing of the greater miracle here.<p>&#8226; By asking &#8220;Where,&#8221; Jesus subtly redirects thinking from resources to Source. Shortly afterward He declares, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The miracle sets the stage for that teaching.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a> shows Jesus fully aware of both the crowd&#8217;s need and His disciples&#8217; limitations. He lifts His eyes, chooses Philip for a faith-stretching conversation, and frames a question that exposes human insufficiency while pointing to divine provision. The verse prepares our hearts to see Christ as the true Bread who satisfies every hunger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The converse with Philip is also peculiar to this Gospel. (Comp. <a href="/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) The impression of the immediate antecedents of the miracle is different from, but not opposed to, that of the other narratives. They all represent the request coming from the disciples as the first step. St. John does not say it was not so They represent what took place as seen from the outer circle; he, from the point of view of those near to his Master. We may think of the group of disciples seated round Him, and of the first-called Andrew and Peter, James and John, and Philip (comp. <a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) as closer to Him than the others, who come and speak to Him about the multitudes. While the wants of all are present, the wants of the individuals are not absent. There is something in the character of Philip which this occasion may test. To him is the question spoken which may yet have been an answer to their remark. For "saw a great company come," read <span class= "ital">saw that a great multitude cometh.</span> It is the vivid present of the crowd coming. "Whence shall we buy bread . . .?" or rather, <span class= "ital">Whence are we to buy bread?</span> with the best MSS.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore</span>, seated with his disciples on the rising ground in full view of the lake with its shipping and its fringe of villages, and of the gathering crowds of pilgrims to the Passover, <span class="cmt_word">having lifted up his eyes, and having beheld that a great multitude cometh</span> (was coming) <span class="cmt_word">unto him, saith</span>. <a href="/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>, <a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>, and <a href="/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a> show that the miracle which they all, with John, prepare to describe was preceded by a day in which the Lord instructed the multitudes, "had compassion upon them," "taught them many things," "spake to them concerning the kingdom of God," "healed their sick." The first approach of the multitude was the occasion of a suggestion which Jesus made to Philip. The other evangelists record the reopening of the conversation on the same theme, stimulated by the question already put to Philip in the forenoon, and on this occasion originated by the disciples. The company arrived by the head of the lake (cf. <a href="/mark/6-33.htm">Mark 6:33</a>, "They ran afoot out of all the cities"); and the first compassionate thought is attributed by John to the Lord himself: <span class="cmt_word">Whence are we to</span> <span class="cmt_word">buy</span> (bread) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, that these multitudes may eat?</span> This very question shows the intimate relations between our Lord and his disciples - the touch of nature. The identification of his interests with theirs is in the "we." Why should Philip be selected for the questioning or suggestion? Luthardt argues that it was a part of the needed education of that apostle that he should have been submitted to the searching anxiety.
