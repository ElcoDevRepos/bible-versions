It is often interpreted as the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was given to the believers, as described in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. This event marked a significant turning point in the early church, empowering the disciples to spread the gospel with boldness and clarity.<p><b>you will know</b><br>The knowledge mentioned here is not merely intellectual but experiential and spiritual. It signifies a profound realization and assurance that comes through the Holy Spirit. This aligns with the promise of the Spirit as the Counselor who will teach and remind the disciples of everything Jesus has said (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>that I am in My Father</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father. It reflects the theological concept of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one. This unity is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus declares, "I and the Father are one."<p><b>and you are in Me</b><br>Here, Jesus speaks of the believers' union with Him. This concept is foundational to Christian identity and is further elaborated in passages like <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the vine and believers as the branches. This union signifies a shared life, purpose, and destiny with Christ.<p><b>and I am in you</b><br>This phrase highlights the indwelling presence of Christ in the believer through the Holy Spirit. It is a promise of continual fellowship and empowerment, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states, "Christ lives in me."

The Spirit should so bring the life of Christ to their hearts that they would read in it the manifestation of the Father, and feel that in and through that life their own spirit has communion with God. The Spirit would witness with their spirit that they were the children of God. They would seek no longer for a Theophany from without, but in the depth of their inmost lives would cry, "Abba, Father."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span> of glorious re-communion with you, begun in the Resurrection-surprises, which will aid your faith and triumphantly establish the mysteries and marvels of Pentecost, <span class="cmt_word">you shall know</span> what you now most imperfectly apprehend by faith, that <span class="cmt_word">I am in my Father</span>, as One lifted up into God, and that I act entirely with and for and as my Father, fulfilling all that I have told you of my personal relationship with him; <span class="accented">and then</span>, he adds, <span class="accented">you shall know</span> that as I am in my Father, you (are) in me, living in and by my power, and continuously drawing life from me; and what is still more, <span class="cmt_word">I in you</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Father has acted in and through my will, and I have spoken his words and done his works, so I will energize in you.
