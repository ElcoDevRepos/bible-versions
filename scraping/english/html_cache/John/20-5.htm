The act of bending down indicates a sense of urgency and curiosity. In the cultural context of the time, tombs were often carved into rock and required one to stoop to see inside. This action reflects a personal and investigative approach to the resurrection, emphasizing the importance of witnessing the evidence firsthand. The act of looking in signifies a desire to understand and verify the events that have transpired.<p><b>at the linen cloths lying there</b><br>The linen cloths are significant as they were used to wrap Jesus' body after His crucifixion. The presence of the cloths, lying undisturbed, suggests that Jesus' body was not stolen, as grave robbers would not have taken the time to unwrap the body. This detail aligns with the resurrection narrative, indicating that Jesus rose from the dead, leaving behind the burial cloths. The mention of linen cloths also connects to the burial customs of the time, providing historical context to the account.<p><b>but he did not go in</b><br>Peter's hesitation to enter the tomb may reflect a sense of reverence or shock at the sight before him. This moment of pause allows for contemplation and underscores the gravity of the resurrection event. In the broader biblical narrative, this hesitation can be seen as a moment of transition from doubt to belief, as Peter processes the implications of the empty tomb. This phrase also sets the stage for the subsequent actions of the other disciples, highlighting the varying responses to the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and leadership among the apostles.

The beloved disciple does not rush. Like Mary who later &#8220;bent down to look into the tomb&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11</a>), and like Peter in <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a> who also &#8220;bent down,&#8221; this posture underscores awe before God&#8217;s works. It recalls moments when servants of God lowered themselves in holy places&#8212;Moses removing his sandals before the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>) and Elijah covering his face at Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>).<p>&#8226;Stooping signals respect for a place touched by the power of God.<p>&#8226;It also shows eagerness: John cannot stay away, yet he approaches thoughtfully, honoring the sacredness of the scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and looked in</b><p>The disciple&#8217;s gaze is intentional; he wants firsthand evidence. Scripture often links seeing with belief&#8212;&#8220;what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked upon&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). Angels themselves &#8220;long to look into these things&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>), and here a human witness does the same.<p>&#8226;This &#8220;look&#8221; is the beginning of testimony that will soon spread (<a href="/john/20-8.htm">John 20:8</a>; <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226;It reminds us that faith is never blind credulity; God provides observable signs so we may &#8220;know the certainty of the things we have been taught&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the linen cloths lying there</b><p>What John sees matters. The grave wrappings are still present, exactly where Jesus&#8217; body had been laid after Joseph and Nicodemus &#8220;wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>). <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a> notes the same detail, and John will soon add that &#8220;the cloth that had been around Jesus&#8217; head was folded up by itself&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226;Grave robbers would not unwrap a body and neatly arrange cloths; the orderly scene argues powerfully for resurrection, not theft (<a href="/matthew/28-11.htm">Matthew 28:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226;The calm arrangement echoes <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>, where the Servant acts wisely&#8212;nothing frantic or chaotic surrounds the risen Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he did not go in</b><p>John hesitates, holding back until Peter arrives and enters first (<a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6</a>). Respect for Peter&#8217;s recognized leadership (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18&#8211;19</a>) may guide him, but the moment also illustrates differing temperaments in the body of Christ.<p>&#8226;Some, like Peter, are impetuous; others, like John, are reflective&#8212;yet both will soon stand together proclaiming the risen Savior (<a href="/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226;The pause heightens suspense and invites us to ponder. God sometimes allows a moment of waiting so the truth can settle into our hearts (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p>&#8226;John&#8217;s restraint does not diminish his faith; when he finally enters, &#8220;he saw and believed&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-8.htm">John 20:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John&#8217;s slight stoop, careful look, focus on the linen cloths, and respectful delay weave a vivid, trustworthy picture of resurrection morning. The empty tomb is not myth but verifiable history. The evidence is orderly, open to inspection, and convincing to anyone willing to bend down, look in, and consider what God has done.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">seeth the linen clothes lying.</span> The tense still describes the scene as it actually occurred. The words "looking in" rightly complete the meaning. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/11-38.htm" title="Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.">John 11:38</a>, and for the word, Note on <a href="/luke/24-12.htm" title="Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.">Luke 24:12</a>.) It is used again in the New Testament only in <a href="/john/20-11.htm" title="But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,">John 20:11</a>, <a href="/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">James 1:25</a>, and <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>.

For the "linen clothes," comp. <a href="/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having stooped down</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is the verb used in <a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a> to describe Peter's conduct and gesture. It was a necessary preliminary of the subsequent act of Peter, though Luke does not refer to it. Peter himself uses the same word (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). It means literally "bending on one side," with a desire to gaze intently on an object (Ecclus. 14:23 Ecclus. 21:23; <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He seeth the linen clothes lying</span> (see <a href="/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>), untenanted and unused, those very cerecloths which he had helped to wind round the sacred, wounded body, with their affluence of sweet spices. <span class="cmt_word">Yet entered he not within</span>. Awe, reverence, mystery, fear, nascent hope, the thought most possibly, "Not here, but risen," began to dawn faintly on his mind.

If so, then Peter, before he came to the conclusion that there was no death in the sepulcher, broke a ritual law which John respected. There seems also rabbinical authority for the fact that disciples might carry "the just" to their grave without such tear of pollution. But at this moment they were both lifted above the region of ritual altogether. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He bent down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#973;&#968;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(parakypsas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3879.htm">Strong's 3879: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stoop, peer in, look down, look intently.
