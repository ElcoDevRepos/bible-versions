It suggests a moment of realization or understanding, often seen in the Gospels when the disciples connect Jesus' actions to Old Testament prophecies or teachings. This remembrance is significant as it shows the growing awareness among the disciples of Jesus' fulfillment of scripture.<p><b>that it is written:</b><br>This phrase introduces a direct quotation from the Old Testament, emphasizing the authority and continuity of scripture. It reflects the Jewish tradition of grounding actions and beliefs in the sacred texts. The use of "it is written" underscores the importance of scripture as a foundation for understanding Jesus' mission and identity.<p><b>&#8220;Zeal for Your house</b><br>This part of the verse is a direct reference to <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>, which is a Messianic psalm. The "house" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. Jesus' zeal for the temple reflects His deep commitment to the purity and sanctity of worship. In the cultural context, the temple was not only a religious center but also a place of national identity for the Jewish people.<p><b>will consume Me.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "will consume Me" indicates a profound passion and dedication that leads to personal cost or sacrifice. In the context of Jesus' life, this foreshadows His eventual suffering and death. The use of the word "consume" suggests an all-encompassing fervor that aligns with Jesus' mission to restore true worship and relationship with God. This zeal ultimately leads to His confrontation with the religious authorities and His crucifixion, fulfilling His role as the suffering servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His zeal for the purity and sanctity of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who recall the Old Testament scripture in response to Jesus' actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The physical location where the event takes place, representing the dwelling place of God among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/psalm_69_-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a></b><br>The Old Testament scripture that the disciples remember, which speaks of zeal for God's house.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cleansing_of_the_temple.htm">Cleansing of the Temple</a></b><br>The event where Jesus drives out the money changers and merchants, showcasing His righteous indignation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_god's_house.htm">Zeal for God's House</a></b><br>Jesus' actions demonstrate a passionate commitment to the holiness and reverence of God's dwelling place.

It gives us the thought of the disciples at the time (comp. <a href="/john/2-22.htm" title="When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.">John 2:22</a>) which could be known only to one of their number. It shows us what we too seldom realise in reading the New Testament, that the Jewish mind was filled to overflowing with thoughts of the Old Testament. The child was taught to say by heart large portions of the Law and Psalms and Prophets, and they formed the very texture of the mind, ready to pass into conscious thought whenever occasion suggested. With the exception of the 22nd Psalm, no part of the Old Testament is so frequently referred to in the New as the psalm from which these words are taken (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm" title="For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached you are fallen on me.">Psalm 69:9</a>), and yet that psalm could not have been in its historic meaning Messianic (see, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a>; <a href="/context/john/2-22.htm" title="When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.">John 2:22-25</a>). This reference to it gives us, then, their method of interpretation. Every human life is typical. The persecution without reason, the wrong heaped upon the innocent, the appeal to and trust in Jehovah, the song of thanksgiving from him whose parched throat was weary of calling--all this was true of some representative sufferer of earlier days, and we may hear in it almost certainly the voice of Jeremiah; but it was true of him in that he was a forerunner of <span class= "ital">the</span> representative sufferer. The darker features of the psalm belong to the individual; the Life which sustains in all, and the Light which illumines in all, was even then in the world, though men knew Him not. The words of Jeremiah are Messianic, because his life--like every noble, self-forgetting, others' sorrow bearing, man and God loving life--was itself Messianic.<p>The change of tense, from the past of the Psalmist to the future here, is itself significant. The words were true of the inner burning which consumed the prophet-priest. They come to the heart as true, with a fuller truth, of Christ's spirit burning with righteous indignation, and cast down by deepest sorrow; but shrinking not from the painful task, which leaves its mark falling on that face as the shadow of a deeper darkness. They are to be, in a deeper sense, truer still.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His disciples remembered that it was written,</span> <span class="cmt_word">The zeal of thy house will consume</span> <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. The future tense, affirmed by the best manuscripts, never (Meyer) bears the present meaning. The disciples, familiar with the Old Testament, remembered at the time the words of <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>. In that psalm the theocratic Sufferer approached the climax of his sorrows, and admitted that a holy zeal for God's house will ultimately consume him - eat him up. Tile word is used for consuming emotions (cf. Aristoph., 'Vespae,' 287), and there is a foreshadowing of the reproach and agony which will befall the righteous Servant of God in his passion for God's honour. The parallelism of the second clause of the verse, "The reproaches of them that reproached thee have fallen upon me," confirm the application, though the words are not cited. Several other citations are made in the New Testament from this psalm, which, whether it be Messianic in the oracular sense or not, is dearly one that furnished the mind of the early Church with abundant illustration of the suffering of the Christ (<a href="/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a>; <a href="/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9, 10</a>; <a href="/acts/1-20.htm">Acts 1:20</a>; cf. also <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a> with the narrative of the Crucifixion).
