The miracle performed by Jesus was so astonishing that it led to confusion and debate among the onlookers. This reflects the common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' miracles often led to mixed reactions, with some believing and others doubting. The skepticism here can be seen as a reflection of the broader disbelief that Jesus faced throughout His ministry, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12-13</a>, where there was division among the people about who Jesus was.<p><b>but others said, &#8220;No, he just looks like him.&#8221;</b><br>This skepticism is indicative of the human tendency to doubt what seems impossible. The transformation of the blind man was so complete that some could not believe it was the same person. This reflects the broader theme of spiritual blindness found in the Gospel of John, where physical sight is often used as a metaphor for spiritual insight. The doubt expressed here parallels the disbelief of the Pharisees and others who refused to accept Jesus' miracles as evidence of His divine authority, as seen in <a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-40</a>.<p><b>But the man kept saying, &#8220;I am the one.&#8221;</b><br>The healed man's insistence on his identity underscores the personal testimony aspect of faith. His repeated affirmation serves as a powerful witness to the transformative power of Jesus. This personal testimony is a key element in the Gospel of John, where individual encounters with Jesus often lead to profound declarations of faith, such as the Samaritan woman's testimony in <a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39</a>. The man's persistence also highlights the theme of personal conviction in the face of doubt and opposition, a theme that resonates throughout the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>, where Peter and John assert their commitment to testify about what they have seen and heard.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who was healed by Jesus.

They oppose to it their own opinion, that it is a case of resemblance only. He himself sets the question at rest by declaring that he is the same person.<p>The verse, and indeed the whole narrative, is one of the many striking instances of the natural form which is taken by the narrative of one personally acquainted with all the facts. We may suppose that St. John recorded this from the lips of the man himself. We can still see the whole picture;--the man returning, observed by one or two neighbours, who spread the story; the excitement of their curiosity; the question whether he is really the same; some struck by the points of identity in the features, and declaring that he is; others struck by the features of the opened eyes lighting up the whole face, and declaring that he is not; the simple declaration of the man himself, which is at once accepted as decisive--all this passes before us just as it occurred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some said, It is he: others</span>, <span class="cmt_word">No</span> <span class="cmt_word">but he is like him.</span> So great a change might well have provoked inquiry as to his identity, and the two classes of speakers add amazing vivacity to the picture.
