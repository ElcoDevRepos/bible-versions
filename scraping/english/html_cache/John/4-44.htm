The use of "testified" suggests a formal declaration, underscoring the truth and weight of His words. This statement is consistent with Jesus' role as a prophet, one who speaks the truth of God, often in the face of opposition.<p><b>that a prophet has no honor</b><br>The concept of a prophet lacking honor is a recurring theme in the Bible. Prophets often faced rejection and persecution, as seen with figures like Jeremiah and Elijah. This lack of honor reflects the human tendency to resist divine messages, especially when they challenge established norms or call for repentance.<p><b>in his own hometown.</b><br>Jesus' reference to His "own hometown" is significant, as it highlights the familiarity that breeds contempt. In the context of Jesus' ministry, this refers to Nazareth, where He was raised. The people of Nazareth knew Jesus as the carpenter's son, which made it difficult for them to accept His divine authority and messianic identity. This rejection is documented in other Gospel accounts, such as <a href="/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a> and <a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>, where Jesus is not accepted by those who knew Him best. This phrase also foreshadows the broader rejection Jesus would face from His own people, the Israelites, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who makes the statement about a prophet's honor.

It is significant as His "own country" where He experienced a lack of honor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>The reference to prophets highlights a broader biblical theme where God's messengers often face rejection from their own people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>The region Jesus left to return to Galilee. This context is important as it contrasts the reception He received in different areas.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>Prior to this verse, Jesus had been in Samaria, where He was received with belief, contrasting with the reception in His own country.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rejection.htm">Understanding Rejection</a></b><br>Jesus' experience teaches us that rejection, especially from those closest to us, is a common experience for those who follow God's calling.

Jesus leaves a place where He was warmly received (<a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39&#8211;42</a>) and heads toward Galilee. This transition reminds us of similar narrative pivots such as <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a> and <a href="/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>, where &#8220;now&#8221; shifts our focus without breaking the story&#8217;s flow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He Himself</b><p>The double emphasis points directly to Jesus&#8212;no secondhand report, no rumor. It is the same Lord who personally affirmed His identity to the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-26.htm">John 4:26</a>) and personally cleansed the temple (<a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15</a>). Other Gospel writers echo this firsthand authority: &#8220;He began teaching them&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>) and &#8220;He was teaching in their synagogues&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>). The point: Jesus is not quoting others; He is the ultimate authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had testified</b><p>&#8220;Had testified&#8221; reaches back to an earlier moment. John does not record that earlier statement in Galilee until later events unfold, but the synoptic parallels fill it in (<a href="/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>; <a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>). Testifying is a legal-sounding word in John (see <a href="/john/1-34.htm">John 1:34</a>; 5:39), underscoring the reliability of Jesus&#8217; words. He speaks truth that stands in any courtroom&#8212;earthly or heavenly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that a prophet</b><p>By using &#8220;prophet,&#8221; Jesus places Himself in the line of men like Elijah and Jeremiah (<a href="/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>). He is more than a prophet (<a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14&#8211;15</a>), yet He willingly steps into that role. In <a href="/luke/13-33.htm">Luke 13:33</a> He says, &#8220;Surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem,&#8221; hinting that rejection has always dogged God&#8217;s messengers. Recognizing Jesus as prophet sharpens our responsibility to listen, just as Israel was to heed Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has no honor</b><p>Honor involves respect, trust, and willingness to obey. <a href="/psalms/69-8.htm">Psalm 69:8&#8211;9</a> foretold Messiah&#8217;s rejection by His own family, and <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> declared Him &#8220;despised and rejected by men.&#8221; When people think they already know someone, they often withhold honor. <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> captures this tragedy: &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his own hometown</b><p>For Jesus, &#8220;hometown&#8221; points to Nazareth in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>) and broadly to Galilee itself among Judeans (<a href="/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41, 52</a>). In Nazareth, the crowd tried to throw Him off a cliff (<a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28&#8211;29</a>). Even His brothers did not believe at first (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). The pattern stretches back to Joseph scorned by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>) and forward to Paul dismissed in Tarsus until Barnabas intervened (<a href="/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; 11:25&#8211;26). Familiarity can dull spiritual sensitivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-44.htm">John 4:44</a> reminds us that Jesus, though Lord of all, experienced the sting of rejection where He should have been most celebrated. The verse prepares us for mixed reactions in Galilee and invites us to examine whether familiarity with Christ has dulled our own honor of Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">A prophet hath no honour.</span>--The statement that a prophet hath no honour in his own country is at first thought a strange explanation of the fact that He went into Galilee, and that the Galileans received Him; and the common geographical solutions, as that "His own country" means Judaea, or Nazareth, as distinct from Galilee, or the district of the so-called lower Galilee, are brought to, not from, the text. The narrative of the earlier Gospels places the commencement of the ministry in Galilee. John has in these opening chapters told of an earlier ministry in Judaea and Samaria. He now records the reception in Galilee to which this earlier ministry had been the real introduction. Jesus Himself said so. He knew the principle that a prophet's own friends are the last to hear his message, and He came to His own country only when that message had been received by many in Judaea and Samaria, and when His own countrymen had seen and known His work at the Passover. Others had received Him at Jerusalem, and they therefore receive Him in Galilee. The honour is brought from without. It does not arise in His own country.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
