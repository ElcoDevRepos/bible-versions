Isaiah's ministry took place during a turbulent period in Israel's history, around the 8th century BC, when the Assyrian Empire was a significant threat. His prophecies often addressed both immediate concerns and future messianic expectations. Isaiah's writings are foundational for understanding the nature and mission of the Messiah, as they include prophecies about the suffering servant and the future glory of God's kingdom.<p><b>because he saw Jesus&#8217; glory</b><br>This statement connects Isaiah's vision to the pre-incarnate Christ, suggesting that the glory Isaiah witnessed was indeed the glory of Jesus. In <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>, Isaiah describes a vision of the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. This vision is often interpreted as a theophany, a visible manifestation of God, which in the New Testament context is understood as a Christophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. The glory seen by Isaiah is thus linked to the divine majesty and holiness of Jesus, affirming His eternal existence and divine nature.<p><b>and spoke about Him.</b><br>Isaiah's prophecies, particularly those found in chapters 52 and 53, are seen as direct references to Jesus Christ. These passages describe the suffering servant, who would bear the sins of many and be exalted. The New Testament writers frequently cite Isaiah to demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled these messianic prophecies. Isaiah's words not only pointed to the coming of the Messiah but also to His suffering, death, and ultimate glorification, which are central themes in the life and mission of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the coming Messiah and the salvation of the Lord.

The verse therefore confirms Christ&#8217;s deity, the unity of Scripture, and the certainty that every prophetic word finds its fulfillment in Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory.</span>--The better text is, . . . <span class= "ital">because he saw His glory.</span> (Comp. Note on the reading in <a href="/john/12-17.htm" title="The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.">John 12:17</a>.) The result of seeing His glory was that he spake of Him. This is St. John's interpretation of the prophecy. Isaiah himself tells us, "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple" (<a href="/john/6-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.">John 6:1</a>). But no man hath seen God at any time. The Word is the express image of His Person.

Because the prophet saw the glory of Christ, the unutterable majesty of the "Word of God," he delivered, as we know, this tremendous burden. Few utterances of the New Testament convey in more startling form the conviction of the apostles touching the pre-existence of the Lord, and the identification of the Divine Personality of the Christ, with the highest conception that the Hebrew prophet entertained of the Almighty One, of the eternal Godhead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Isaiah</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7976;&#963;&#945;&#912;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;saias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2268.htm">Strong's 2268: </a> </span><span class="str2">Isaiah, the prophet.
