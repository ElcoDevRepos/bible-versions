The presence of a crowd is significant, as it highlights the public nature of the event and the widespread interest in Jesus' ministry. This moment occurs shortly after Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where He was hailed as a king. The crowd's reaction to the voice from heaven reflects a common theme in Scripture where divine communication is often misunderstood or misinterpreted by those who hear it.<p><b>and said that it had thundered.</b><br>The perception of the voice as thunder is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's voice is described in terms of natural phenomena, such as in <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>, where the voice of the Lord is over the waters and is described as thunderous. This reflects the majesty and power of God's voice, which can be overwhelming and awe-inspiring. The misunderstanding of the voice as thunder also underscores the spiritual blindness and lack of discernment among the people, a recurring theme in the Gospels where Jesus' true identity and message are often missed by the crowds.<p><b>Others said that an angel had spoken to Him.</b><br>The belief that an angel had spoken to Jesus indicates a recognition of the supernatural nature of the event, even if the specifics were not understood. In Jewish tradition, angels were seen as messengers of God, often delivering divine messages to individuals. This interpretation by some in the crowd suggests an awareness of the spiritual realm and a willingness to attribute the voice to a heavenly source, even if they did not fully grasp its significance. This moment foreshadows the continued division among the people regarding Jesus' identity and mission, as seen throughout the Gospel of John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people present during Jesus' public ministry, witnessing His teachings and miracles.

Their insertion by a later hand is all but impossible; and they are, moreover, opposed to what must be assumed as the object of a later writer. In a treatise to prove the divinity of Christ there could be no place for them. In a Gospel which assumes the truth that He is divine, and does not seek to prove it, but to bear witness to the life which carries its own proof (comp. Notes on <a href="/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.">John 1:7</a>; <a href="/context/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30-31</a>), they are evidence that the witness is true. The fact that St. John clearly means us to understand (<a href="/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>) that a distinct voice spake from heaven does not forbid our understanding also that this voice was heard more or less distinctly, or was as a voice not heard at all, in proportion as the hearts of the hearers were or were not receptive of the voice of God. To some it seemed but as natural thunder, but their own Scripture had taught again and again "God thundereth marvellously with His voice: great things doeth He which we cannot comprehend," and the religious interpretation of nature hears everywhere the voice of God. Others, and these must have been Pharisees (comp. <a href="/context/acts/23-8.htm" title="For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.">Acts 23:8-9</a>), recognise a voice which is more than that of nature or of man, and think that an angel hath spoken.
