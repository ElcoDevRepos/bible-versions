Jews were known for their strict adherence to the Mosaic Law and their distinct customs, which set them apart from other groups. This acknowledgment also underscores the historical tensions between Jews and Samaritans, who had diverged in their religious practices and beliefs after the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 BC. The Samaritans had intermarried with foreign settlers and developed a syncretistic form of worship, which the Jews considered heretical.<p><b>"How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"</b><br>This question reveals the deep-seated animosity and social barriers between Jews and Samaritans. Jews typically avoided any interaction with Samaritans to maintain ritual purity, as Samaritans were considered unclean. Additionally, the fact that Jesus, a Jewish man, would speak to a Samaritan woman was even more surprising, given the cultural norms that discouraged public conversation between men and women who were not related. This interaction foreshadows the breaking down of social and ethnic barriers through the gospel, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul writes that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek.<p><b>(For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)</b><br>This parenthetical note provides insight into the historical context of Jewish-Samaritan relations. The animosity stemmed from religious differences, as Samaritans accepted only the Pentateuch and rejected the rest of the Hebrew Scriptures. They also built their own temple on Mount Gerizim, which was destroyed by the Jews in the second century BC. This longstanding hostility is evident in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52-53</a>, where a Samaritan village refuses to receive Jesus because He is heading to Jerusalem. The note emphasizes the radical nature of Jesus' actions and His mission to transcend cultural and religious boundaries, ultimately fulfilling prophecies of a Messiah who would be a light to all nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who engages in a conversation with the Samaritan woman, breaking social norms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A resident of Samaria who encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.

She wondered that a Jew, weary and thirsty though he might be, should speak to her. For the origin of the Samaritans, see <a href="/context/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24-41</a>, and Note on <a href="/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>. The later Jewish authors abound in terms of reproach for them--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> "He who eats the bread of a Samaritan is as he who eats swine's flesh;" "No Samaritan shall be made a proselyte;" "They have no share in the resurrection of the dead" (<span class= "ital">Pirke,</span> Rabbi Elieser, 38; comp. Farrar, <span class= "ital">Life of Christ,</span> i. 209, note). Jesus Himself speaks of a Samaritan as an alien (<a href="/luke/17-16.htm" title="And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.">Luke 17:16</a>; <a href="/luke/17-18.htm" title="There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.">Luke 17:18</a>; comp. <a href="/luke/10-33.htm" title="But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,">Luke 10:33</a>), and is called a Samaritan and possessed of a devil (comp. <a href="/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>). But the strictest Jews allowed exceptions to the forbidden intercourse. If bread was interdicted, fruit and vegetables were not; if boiled eggs were forbidden, fresh ones were not. At no time probably did the Galileans follow the practice of the Judaeans in this matter, and hence they go to the city to buy food, while the woman asks this question of a Jew whom she met on the road from Jerusalem. Later, it was only "because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem "that the Samaritan village did not receive Him; and it is the Evangelist of the Jerusalem ministry, who would have called down fire from heaven then, who adds this note of explanation for his Greek readers now (<a href="/context/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52-53</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The Samaritan woman therefore saith to him, How is it (compare this "how" with that of Nicodemus. Jesus had at once provoked inquiry, which he was not unwilling to gratify) - How is it that thou, being a Jew? She would have known that he was a Jew by his speech, for the Samaritans were accustomed to turn the sound of <span class="accented">sh</span> into that of <span class="accented">s</span>; and so, when Jesus said in Jewish Aramaic, <span class="accented">Teni lishekoth</span>, "Give me to drink," while she would herself have said, <span class="accented">Teni lise-koth</span>, his speech would betray him. Again, the contour of the Jewish face differs greatly from that of the Samaritan, and the customary fringes on their robes were of different national colours. Moreover, his appearance, travel stained, weary, and thirsty, on the great highway between Galilee and Judaea, would have suggested at once that he was no Samaritan. <span class="cmt_word">Askest drink from me, who am a Samaritan, and a woman, too?</span> Already this was a startling puzzle, for her experience so far had only shown her that <span class="cmt_word">Jews have no dealings</span> (a word only once and here used in the New Testament) <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">Samaritans</span>. Most commentators suppose that this is an explanatory remark of the evangelist, pointing to the absence, in a hostile and haughty spirit, of all pleasant relations between the peoples (see note at commencement of chapter). We are not compelled to this conclusion. The words may just as likely have been the pert, half-ironical tone of the woman, who was drawing a contrast between the current profession of Israelites and the request which the need of Jesus had extorted (Moulton). The eighth verse had just said that the disciples had clearly some dealings with Samaritans, and had gone to purchase food at Sychar, taking with them the apparatus used for drawing water. This last fact is the evangelist's reason for introducing the remark of the woman.
