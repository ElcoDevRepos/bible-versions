His inquiry about the specific hour of recovery highlights the importance of understanding the connection between Jesus' words and the miracle. This reflects the biblical theme of faith seeking understanding, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, where faith is described as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. The nobleman's inquiry also underscores the human desire to verify and understand the divine intervention in our lives.<p><b>and they told him, &#8220;The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.&#8221;</b><br>The response from the servants indicates the precise timing of the miracle, which aligns with Jesus' declaration of healing. The "seventh hour" in Jewish timekeeping corresponds to 1 PM, suggesting a significant moment of divine intervention. This timing is crucial as it confirms the immediacy and power of Jesus' word, echoing the creation narrative where God's word brings forth life and order (Genesis 1). The mention of "yesterday" implies a journey of faith for the nobleman, who had to trust in Jesus' promise before seeing the physical evidence. This mirrors the faith journey of believers who trust in God's promises, as seen in <a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>, where Abraham's faith is credited as righteousness. The healing at a distance also prefigures the power of Jesus' resurrection, where His victory over sin and death transcends time and space, offering eternal life to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_official.htm">The Royal Official</a></b><br>A man of authority, likely serving under Herod Antipas, who seeks Jesus for the healing of his son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>The child of the royal official who was gravely ill and whose healing is central to this account.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, whose miraculous power and authority are demonstrated in the healing of the official's son.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where the royal official's son lay sick, and where Jesus performed many miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seventh_hour.htm">The Seventh Hour</a></b><br>The time when the fever left the official's son, indicating the precise moment of Jesus' intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_jesus'_word.htm">Faith in Jesus' Word</a></b><br>The royal official believed Jesus' word without seeing immediate evidence.

He remembers the hour at which one was spoken; he inquires the hour at which the other was realised. He does not even now grasp the full meaning of the words, and thinks of the gradual abatement of the fever, and the slow convalescence, and asks when the child "began to amend." They have seen the sudden change as of a new power passing into the body on the point of death. They have spoken of this as a new life, and they now think of the fever as having completely left him.<p><span class= "bld">Yesterday at the seventh hour.</span>--We have seen (<a href="/john/1-39.htm" title="He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.">John 1:39</a>) that there is no sufficient reason for thinking that St. John uses the western method of counting the hours of the day. Still less is it likely that Galilean servants, who are here the speakers, should have done so. To believe, moreover, that it was seven o'clock in the morning or evening adds to, and does not remove, the difficulty of the length of time implied in "yesterday." To say that the father remained some time with Jesus, and that "the believer doth not make haste," is to pervert both the spirit and the words of the text. He clearly went at once (<a href="/john/4-50.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.">John 4:50</a>), and his anxiety naturally quickened his speed. The distance was not more than twenty-five English miles, and he had not travelled the whole of it, for the servants had gone to meet him. The supposed explanation cannot therefore be explained. But the words, if taken in their simple meaning, involve no such difficulty. These Jews, as all Jews, meant by the "seventh hour" the seventh from sunrise, what we should call one o'clock. After sunset the same evening they would have commenced a new day (comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus F.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and this seventh hour would be to them as one o'clock the day before, or the seventh hour yesterday. We have thus an interval of five or six hours between the words spoken by our Lord and their confirmation by the servants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - The father is full of joy at the blessed intelligence, but naturally seeks at once to link the event with the word and will of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">He therefore inquired from them the hour in which he began to amend</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>). (This peculiar phrase is suitable on the lips of a man of rank; literally, "he did bravely, exceedingly well;" and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is occasionally used in contradistinction with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in a similar sense. Epictetus, 'Diss.,' 3:10-13.) <span class="cmt_word">They say to him, therefore, Yesterday during the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> The advocates of John's adoption of the Roman computation of time suppose that this was <span class="accented">seven p.m.</span>, and, therefore, that a night had intervened on the return journey (so Westcott, Edersheim, and Moulton). This is not necessary, because, even on the Jewish computation, from sunrise to sunset, though the seventh hour must then mean between noon and one p.m., it could not have happened that much before midnight he should have broken into the streets of Capernaum. At that hour the noon <span class="accented">might</span> be spoken of as "yesterday." This, however, is not imperative; for, if the distance between Capernaum and Cana was from twenty to twenty-five miles, and if the nobleman had travelled to Cana on the day that he presented his request, it is clear that a night's halt might easily have been required. Baur and Hilgenfeld make the note of time an attempt on the part of the writer to exaggerate the marvel, as if the distance through which the will of Christ asserted itself could augment the wonder, or that the real supernatural could be measured by milestones. And Thoma thinks so poorly of the originality of the Johannist, that he imagines him to have worked into his narrative some of the small details of the Cornelius and Peter interviews in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
