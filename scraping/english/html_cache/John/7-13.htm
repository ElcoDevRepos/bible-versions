The people were aware of the growing controversy about Jesus' identity and teachings. Public discourse about Him was avoided due to the potential repercussions from religious authorities. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels of Jesus being a divisive figure, as seen in <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>, where the fear of being expelled from the synagogue silenced many believers. The reluctance to speak openly also underscores the secretive nature of early belief in Jesus, which would later be transformed into bold proclamation after the resurrection and Pentecost (Acts 2).<p><b>for fear of the Jews</b><br>In this context, "the Jews" refers primarily to the Jewish religious leaders, such as the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin, who were increasingly hostile towards Jesus. This fear was not unfounded, as these leaders had significant power to enforce religious and social consequences, including excommunication from the synagogue, which was a severe penalty in Jewish society. The fear of the Jews is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, illustrating the growing opposition Jesus faced from the established religious order. This opposition is part of the fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah being rejected by His own people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>. The cultural and historical context of first-century Judea, under Roman occupation, also contributed to the tension, as the Jewish leaders were cautious of any movement that might attract Roman scrutiny or disrupt their tenuous peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, whose teachings and miracles were causing division among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders and authorities who were opposed to Jesus and His teachings, often seeking to arrest or discredit Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events of <a href="/bsb/john/7.htm">John 7</a> take place, particularly during the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness wanderings, during which Jesus was teaching in the temple courts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The general populace attending the feast, who were divided in their opinions about Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_man_vs._fear_of_god.htm">Fear of Man vs. Fear of God</a></b><br>The fear of human opinion can silence truth.

Those who believed in the "goodness" of Jesus were silenced, or did not proceed beyond a feeble murmur of applause, however much some may have felt the truth of their own impression. Those who came to an adverse opinion were also so much cowed by the "Jews," by the ecclesiastical authorities, that even they did not venture to express themselves save "with bated breath and whispered humbleness," lest they might err in the form of their condemnation. The section vers. 14-36 contains three discourses: one of which (vers. 14-24) describes the nature and ground of his human ministry; vers. 25-29, while treating the insolence of the multitude, portray an animated scene of conflicting opinion, in the course of which the Lord renewed the assurance of his Divine <span class="accented">origin</span>, as well as of the Divine sources of his teaching; vers. 30-36 refer to his approaching death or departure, as part of a Divine plan concerning him.
