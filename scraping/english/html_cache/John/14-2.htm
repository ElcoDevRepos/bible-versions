The concept of God's house is rooted in the Old Testament, where the temple in Jerusalem was considered God's earthly dwelling. Jesus expands this idea to a heavenly realm, indicating a personal relationship with God. The "house" signifies a familial and intimate connection, emphasizing God's role as a Father.<p><b>are many rooms.</b><br>The term "rooms" suggests ample space and provision for all believers. This imagery contrasts with earthly limitations, highlighting the inclusivity and abundance of God's kingdom. The Greek word used here can also mean "dwelling places" or "abodes," indicating permanence and security. This reflects the promise of eternal life and a personal place for each believer in heaven.<p><b>If it were not so,</b><br>This phrase underscores the truthfulness and reliability of Jesus' words. It reassures the disciples of the certainty of His promises. In a broader biblical context, it reflects God's faithfulness throughout scripture, as seen in His covenants with figures like Abraham and David.<p><b>would I have told you</b><br>Jesus appeals to His established trustworthiness and the intimate relationship He shares with His disciples. This rhetorical question emphasizes His role as a truthful teacher and prophet, who reveals divine mysteries to His followers. It also reflects the consistent theme of Jesus preparing His disciples for future events, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>that I am going there</b><br>This indicates Jesus' impending departure through His death, resurrection, and ascension. It highlights His role as the forerunner and mediator between God and humanity. The "going" signifies His active role in securing salvation and preparing the way for believers to enter God's presence.<p><b>to prepare a place for you?</b><br>This preparation involves Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, which opens the way to eternal life. It reflects the Jewish custom of a bridegroom preparing a home for his bride, symbolizing the church as the bride of Christ. This imagery is consistent with eschatological themes in Revelation, where believers are united with Christ in the heavenly Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is comforting His disciples with the promise of eternal dwelling places in His Father's house.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father's_house.htm">The Father&#8217;s House</a></b><br>Symbolic of heaven, this is the place where God dwells and where Jesus promises to prepare a place for His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' promise, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/preparation.htm">Preparation</a></b><br>The act of Jesus going to prepare a place signifies His role as the mediator and His work through His death, resurrection, and ascension.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The ultimate destination for believers, depicted as a place with many rooms, indicating abundance and inclusivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Jesus' promise of preparing a place assures believers of their eternal security in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_perspective.htm">Heavenly Perspective</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live with a focus on eternal realities rather than temporary earthly concerns.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The "many rooms" signify that there is ample space for all who believe, highlighting the inclusivity of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_jesus_as_mediator.htm">Role of Jesus as Mediator</a></b><br>Jesus' preparation of a place underscores His role as the mediator between God and humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_and_comfort.htm">Hope and Comfort</a></b><br>This promise provides hope and comfort, especially in times of trouble or uncertainty, reminding believers of their future home.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_14_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 14:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_14_2_Assurance_of_eternal_home.htm">How does John 14:2 assure us of our eternal home with Jesus?

"<span class="accented">My</span> Father" is the grandest name of all - the Divine fatherhood, as conceived in the consciousness of Jesus and revealed to them. Had not he who dwelt for ever in the bosom of the Father come forth, as he alone could, to reveal "the Father" and what the Father had been to him in the eternities? "<span class="accented">My</span> Father's house" is the dwelling-place in which devout believing souls would abide forever (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-1.htm">Psalm 90:1</a>). In the vast home filled by my Father's glory and lighted by his smile of recognition and reconciliation, in the high and holy place (<a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>), are "many mansions" prepared from the foundation of the world (<a href="/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>). Heaven is a large place; its possibilities transcend your imagination and exceed your charity. Thoma quotes all the grand hopes which Paul's Epistles and that to the Hebrews contain, that Jesus made heaven and home by his presence there (<a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14, 17</a>), and he supposes that the Johannist put these words into the lips of Jesus. One conclusion forced upon the reader, so far as this passage is concerned, is that there is no reason why this Gospel may not have been written long before the close of the first century. <span class="cmt_word">If it were not</span> <span class="cmt_word">so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if there were any doubt about it, if the revelations already made do not avail to prove as much as this, if you have been cherishing nothing better than vain illusions on this subject, <span class="cmt_word">I would have told you</span>, for I came forth from God, and know these many mansions well. I would have told you, for all things that I have heard from the Father (up to <span class="accented">this</span> time possible for you to receive) I have made known to you. Here surely is a colon, if not a period. Many interpreters, by reason of the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> which Lachmann, Tischendorf, Westcott, and Meyer believe to be the correct reading, link the following sentence in different ways to the preceding; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, some say <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is equivalent to "<span class="accented">that</span>," and read, "<span class="accented">I</span> would have told you that I go, etc.; but against this is the simple statement of Ver. 3, where Jesus proceeds to say that he <span class="accented">is</span> going to prepare, etc. Others, translating <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "<span class="accented">for</span>," differ as to whether the departure of Jesus and his preparation of a place for his disciples refers to the first or second part of the sentence. Surely the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "<span class="accented">because"</span> or "<span class="accented">for</span>," opens out a new thought based on the whole of that sentence: "Because, seeing if it were not so, I would have told <span class="accented">you</span>," because our relations are so close as to have involved on your part this claim on my frankness, <span class="cmt_word">for I am going to prepare a place</span> - to make ready one of these many mansions - <span class="cmt_word">for you</span>. Over and above the vague mystery of the Father's house, my departure is that of your "<span class="accented">Forerunner</span>," and my presence will make a new resting-place - it will localize your home. As you have made ready this guest-chamber for me, I am going to make ready a presence-chamber for you in the heavenly Jerusalem. Lange objects to this view of Lucke, Calvin, and Tholuck, that it involves a diffusion of knowledge and revelation among the disciples, of which there is no proof. This does not seem bettered by another rendering preferred by him, viz. "If it were not so, would I have told you I go to prepare a place for you?" But then this mode of interpretation implies a previous definite instruction as to the part he himself was going to take in the furnishing of the heavenly mansion.
