This moment underscores the fickle nature of public opinion, which had previously hailed Jesus as a king during His triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). The crowd's choice reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, expecting a political liberator rather than a spiritual savior. The phrase also illustrates the influence of the chief priests and elders, who persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas (<a href="/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;but Barabbas!&#8221;</b><br>Barabbas, whose name means "son of the father," presents a stark contrast to Jesus, the true Son of the Father. The choice between Jesus and Barabbas symbolizes the choice between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of this world. Barabbas was known for his involvement in a rebellion, making him a figure of political resistance against Roman rule. This choice reflects the people's desire for a messianic figure who would lead a physical revolt, rather than the spiritual salvation offered by Jesus. The release of Barabbas instead of Jesus also serves as a type of substitutionary atonement, where the guilty is set free while the innocent is condemned, prefiguring the redemptive work of Christ on the cross.<p><b>(Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.)</b><br>Barabbas' role as an insurrectionist is significant in understanding the political climate of Judea under Roman occupation. The Jewish people were under heavy taxation and oppression, leading to frequent uprisings and a longing for deliverance. Barabbas' involvement in such a rebellion made him a popular figure among those who sought to overthrow Roman authority. This context highlights the irony of the situation: the crowd chose a violent revolutionary over the Prince of Peace. The mention of Barabbas as an insurrectionist also emphasizes the miscarriage of justice, as Pilate found no fault in Jesus (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>), yet succumbed to the crowd's demands. This decision reflects the broader theme of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, where human justice fails, but divine justice prevails through the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barabbas.htm">Barabbas</a></b><br>A prisoner who was involved in an insurrection and was released instead of Jesus.

In light of clear evidence, they still preferred to dismiss Him&#8212;a stark picture of the blinding power of sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They shouted</b><p>The volume of the demand underscores a mob&#8217;s sway over reason.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11</a> notes, &#8220;But the chief priests stirred up the crowd&#8230;&#8221;; leaders manipulated public opinion against Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a> warns, &#8220;You shall not follow a crowd in wrongdoing,&#8221; yet the people ignored that command.<p>&#8226; This moment previews <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, where Peter later says they acted &#8220;by the hands of lawless men.&#8221; The praise of Palm Sunday has morphed into the roar of Good Friday&#8212;illustrating how quickly human hearts can turn when untethered from truth (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Barabbas!</b><p>Here the crowd makes its astonishing trade.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a> records the same cry: &#8220;Away with this Man, release Barabbas to us!&#8221;<p>&#8226; Barabbas represents the worst of humanity&#8212;guilt, violence, rebellion&#8212;while Jesus embodies innocence, peace, submission to the Father. Yet the sinner goes free and the sinless One is condemned, pointing to the heart of the gospel: &#8220;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The choosing of Barabbas foreshadows substitutionary atonement&#8212;Jesus takes the place we deserved, so we may receive the freedom He earned (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.</b><p>John adds this fact to underline the irony.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/15-7.htm">Mark 15:7</a> tells us Barabbas &#8220;had committed murder in the insurrection.&#8221; Setting him loose jeopardized public safety, yet the crowd embraced the danger.<p>&#8226; Jesus had just told Pilate, &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). In contrast, Barabbas fought for an earthly uprising. The people preferred a political savior to a spiritual Redeemer, revealing misplaced expectations of the Messiah.<p>&#8226; Their choice anticipates the warning of <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11&#8211;12</a>: only Jesus offers salvation; all other &#8220;saviors&#8221; lead to ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/18-40.htm">John 18:40</a> exposes humanity&#8217;s tragic preference for darkness over Light. The crowd&#8217;s rejection (&#8220;Not this man&#8221;) and frenzied demand (&#8220;They shouted&#8221;) climax in a disastrous exchange (&#8220;But Barabbas!&#8221;), freeing a violent rebel while condemning the sinless Son. Yet through this injustice God accomplished perfect justice: the guilty walk away pardoned because Jesus willingly took their place. The verse therefore calls us to acknowledge the literal accuracy of the event and to embrace its spiritual lesson&#8212;only Christ can save, and choosing anyone or anything else repeats the crowd&#8217;s fatal mistake.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">Then cried they all again.</span>--St. John has not recorded any clamour before, but implies that of <a href="/mark/15-8.htm" title="And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.">Mark 15:8</a>, and <a href="/context/luke/23-5.htm" title="And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.">Luke 23:5-10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Now Barabbas was a robber.</span>--Comp.
