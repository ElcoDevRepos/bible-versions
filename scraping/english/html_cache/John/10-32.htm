His response is calm and measured, reflecting His wisdom and authority. This interaction takes place during the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, a time when many Jews would gather, providing a significant audience for His teachings.<p><b>&#8220;I have shown you many good works</b><br>Jesus refers to His miracles and teachings, which are evidence of His divine mission. These works include healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and raising the dead, all of which align with the messianic prophecies found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. His works are not only miraculous but also compassionate, demonstrating the nature of God&#8217;s kingdom.<p><b>from the Father.</b><br>Jesus emphasizes that His works are not of His own initiative but are done in obedience to God the Father. This highlights the unity between Jesus and the Father, a central theme in the Gospel of John. It also underscores the divine authority behind His actions, as seen in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-20</a>, where Jesus explains His dependence on the Father.<p><b>For which of these</b><br>Here, Jesus challenges the logic of His accusers. By asking this question, He forces them to consider the nature of His works, which are inherently good and beneficial. This rhetorical question exposes the irrationality of their hostility towards Him.<p><b>do you stone Me?&#8221;</b><br>Stoning was a prescribed punishment for blasphemy according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). The Jewish leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy because He claimed to be one with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). However, Jesus&#8217; question highlights the inconsistency in their reasoning, as His works clearly demonstrate His divine authority and identity.

Instead of withdrawing, the Lord addresses them directly, modeling calm courage and truthfulness. His reply reminds us of earlier encounters where He faced hostility yet spoke graciously (<a href="/john/8-59.htm">John 8:59</a>; 18:20&#8211;23). By answering, Jesus sets the stage for exposing their inconsistency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have shown you many good works</b><p>He invites them to remember the visible evidence of His ministry:<p>&#8226; Healing the lame man at Bethesda (<a href="/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1-9</a>)<p>&#8226; Opening blind eyes (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1-7</a>)<p>&#8226; Feeding multitudes (<a href="/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1-14</a>)<p>&#8226; Restoring withered hands, casting out demons, raising the dead (<a href="/matthew/12-13.htm">Matthew 12:13</a>; <a href="/luke/11-14.htm">Luke 11:14</a>; <a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-17</a>)<p>Scripture affirms these deeds as undeniable proof that God was with Him (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; <a href="/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24</a>). Each miracle was not mere spectacle but a &#8220;good work,&#8221; expressing compassion and fulfilling messianic prophecy (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the Father</b><p>Jesus roots every act in His relationship with the Father, echoing &#8220;the Son can do nothing by Himself; He can do only what He sees His Father doing&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>; 14:10-11). The works flow from divine initiative, confirming both His obedience and His unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). Rejecting these works therefore equals rejecting the Father who sent Him (<a href="/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For which of these</b><p>His question is surgical: if the leaders value righteousness, they must specify which &#8220;good&#8221; deed merits execution.

The leaders claim Jesus, a man, makes Himself God (<a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>). Ironically, by attempting to stone the true Son of God they violate the very Law they profess to uphold (<a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>). Their reaction fulfills prophecy about the Messiah being hated without cause (<a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>) and foreshadows the cross, where hostility will peak yet God&#8217;s redemptive purpose will triumph (<a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32</a> reveals Jesus calmly confronting irrational hostility by pointing to His indisputable, Father-given works. He forces His accusers to face the inconsistency of condemning the One whose deeds clearly display God&#8217;s goodness. The verse underscores two truths: Jesus&#8217; works authenticate His divine mission, and rejection of Him cannot be justified on moral grounds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Jesus answered them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> answered the thought which He read in their hearts, and the intention which was expressed by their act.<p><span class= "bld">Many good works have I shewed you from my Father.</span>--For the idea of "good" expressed here, comp.
