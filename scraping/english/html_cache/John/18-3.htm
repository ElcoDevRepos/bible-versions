The "band of soldiers" likely refers to a Roman cohort, which could consist of several hundred soldiers, though not all may have been present. The "officers" are likely the temple guards, who were under the authority of the chief priests and Pharisees. This collaboration between Roman and Jewish authorities highlights the political and religious tensions of the time. The chief priests and Pharisees, representing the Sanhedrin, were threatened by Jesus' growing influence and sought to eliminate Him, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.<p><b>They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.</b><br>The "garden" refers to the Garden of Gethsemane, located on the Mount of Olives, a place Jesus often visited with His disciples (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>). The use of "lanterns and torches" suggests it was nighttime, aligning with the Passover period when the full moon would have provided some light, yet additional illumination was needed for the search. The "weapons" indicate their expectation of resistance, though Jesus had consistently taught peace (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>). This scene fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, where the Shepherd is struck, and the sheep are scattered.

St. John uses the technical word for the Roman cohort. It was the garrison band from Fort Antonia, at the north-east corner of the Temple. This well-known "band" is mentioned again in the New Testament (in <a href="/john/18-12.htm" title="Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,">John 18:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-27.htm" title="Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.">Matthew 27:27</a>; <a href="/mark/15-16.htm" title="And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.">Mark 15:16</a>; <a href="/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a>). (Comp. Notes at these places.) The word occurs also in <a href="/acts/10-1.htm" title="There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,">Acts 10:1</a> ("the Italian band") and <a href="/acts/27-1.htm" title="And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.">Acts 27:1</a> ("Augustus' band"). The Authorised version misleads, by closely connecting in one clause two distinct things, "a band of men and officers." The band was Roman; the "officers" were the Temple servants, of whom we read in <a href="/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45</a>.

Jud.,' 5:05. 8). <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was the proper name for the commander of a <span class="accented">cohors</span>, equivalent to one-sixth of a legion, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a thousand men and a hundred and twenty horsemen. The strength of the cohort differed according to circumstances and need. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:04. 2) says that some <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> consisted of a thousand, some of six hundred, men. It is not rational to suppose that the whole cohort were visibly <span class="accented">present</span>, but they were-present in close proximity. Though John alone mentions the Roman <span class="accented">soldiers</span>, yet cf. <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53, 54</a>, where our Lord says, "Thinkest thou not that I could pray (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">my Father</span>, <span class="accented">and he would henceforth furnish me with more than twelve legions of angels?"</span> - a legion of angels for each one of the little group. The presence of this band of Roman soldiers with the Jewish police gives very great force and impressiveness to this scene of Israel's degradation and of the world's assault upon the Divine Savior. The other hints given by the synoptists of the presence of weapons in the "band," is Peter's use of the sword. Judas brought with him, not only the drilled and armed Roman soldiers, but <span class="cmt_word">the officers from the chief priests and of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Pharisees</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a detachment of the Jewish guard of the temple, under direction of the Sanhedrin. The chief priests would have small difficulty in securing the aid of a detachment of the Roman garrison to prevent popular outbreak at the time of the feast. These <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, under the direction of the chief priests and Pharisees, have been mentioned in <a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32</a> and 45, and the same name is given to the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="/acts/5-22.htm">Acts 5:22, 26</a>, where the high priests and Sadducees are spoken of as their masters. In <a href="/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4, 52</a> the commandants of the temple are spoken of in the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. The Jewish guard was under the custody of one officer, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and he was a man of high rank and dignity (Josephus, ' Ant.,' 20:6. 2; ' Bell. Jud.,' 2:17.2) - not two, but one; the reference to more than one must therefore point to the Roman military official as well, thus unconsciously sustaining the more definite information given by John. Judas with his band <span class="cmt_word">cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons</span>; for, though it was the Paschal full moon, they were intent on finding an individual, whom Judas would identify for them, amid the depths of the olive shades. (<span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> is in its primary sense a torch, or even meteoric light, but it is used for a lamp or lantern; and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> also is used for "torch" primarily, with secondary meaning of "lantern.") Matthew and Mark mention "swords" and "staves," but say nothing of the flaring torches which so arrested the eve of John. Thoma sees a reference to the frequent declaration of Christ, that he was the "Light of the world," and to the contrast between that light and the power of darkness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
