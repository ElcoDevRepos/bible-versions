His initial encounter with Jesus is recorded in <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, where he visits Jesus under the cover of night, possibly to avoid being seen by other Jewish leaders. This nighttime visit symbolizes his initial spiritual darkness and uncertainty. By coming to Jesus now, openly, Nicodemus demonstrates a significant transformation in his faith and understanding of Jesus' identity. His actions here contrast with his earlier secretive approach, indicating a move from fear to boldness.<p><b>also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes</b><br>Myrrh and aloes were expensive spices used in Jewish burial customs to anoint the body and mask the odor of decay. Myrrh, a resin from certain trees, was also one of the gifts brought by the Magi to Jesus at His birth (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>), symbolizing His future suffering and death. Aloes, derived from a fragrant wood, were used for embalming. The use of these spices signifies honor and respect for Jesus, acknowledging His kingship and the sacredness of His body. This act of anointing is reminiscent of the anointing of kings and priests in the Old Testament, further emphasizing Jesus' role as the Anointed One.<p><b>about seventy-five pounds</b><br>The large quantity of spices indicates the high regard Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea had for Jesus. This amount is far greater than what would typically be used for a common burial, suggesting a burial fit for royalty. The use of such a substantial amount of spices aligns with the burial customs of the wealthy and noble, as seen in the burial of kings in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>). This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which states that the Messiah would be with the rich in His death, highlighting the honor and reverence given to Jesus even in His burial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin.

There is no proof that this "ruler of the Jews" and "master in Israel" had been encouraged by the act of Joseph; but it might seem that these two between them had arranged the costly cerements. There is a world of suggestion lying in this quietly mentioned fact. Doubtless there were many others of timid disposition, who had received deeper convictions than the narrative of the Passion seems to suggest. Nicodemus had said, "We know that thou art a Teacher sent from God." By reason of their unacknowledged faith, the way was prepared for the marvelous conversions of Pentecost and later days. Nicodemus came to the cross, in all probability aided by the loving cares of the women and the disciple whom Jesus loved, <span class="cmt_word">bringing a mixture</span> <span class="cmt_word">of myrrh</span>, an odoriferous gum, <span class="cmt_word">and aloes</span>, a fragrant wood, prepared for the embalming process, <span class="cmt_word">about an hundred pounds</span> <span class="cmt_word">weight</span>. This was a vast quantity. It reminds the reader of "the myrrh and aloes" of the royal Bridegroom of the Church (<a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>.); of the frankincense and myrrh brought by the Wise Men of the East; of the lavish gift of Mary the sister of Lazarus; of the outburst of boundless love which, spite of all the cruel persecution and rejection to which the Lord was exposed, at length was lavished upon him.
