This was the only area where non-Jews could come to worship the God of Israel. The Temple was central to Jewish religious life, serving as the place where sacrifices were offered and festivals were celebrated. The presence of commerce in this sacred space was seen as a desecration of its intended purpose.<p><b>He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves</b><br>These animals were necessary for the sacrificial system prescribed in the Mosaic Law. Cattle, sheep, and doves were commonly used in various offerings, including sin and peace offerings. The selling of these animals in the temple courts was convenient for pilgrims traveling from afar who needed to purchase animals for sacrifice. However, this practice had become commercialized and exploitative, detracting from the spiritual significance of the sacrifices.<p><b>and money changers seated at their tables</b><br>Money changers were present to exchange foreign currency for the Tyrian shekel, the only currency accepted for the temple tax. This tax was required of every Jewish male for the upkeep of the temple. The money changers often charged exorbitant fees, turning a necessary service into a means of exploitation. This practice was particularly offensive in the sacred space of the temple, as it prioritized profit over piety. The presence of these money changers and merchants in the temple courts was a significant factor in Jesus' actions to cleanse the temple, as it reflected a corruption of worship and a barrier to genuine devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who observes the activities in the temple courts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer area of the temple in Jerusalem where commerce was taking place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_selling_cattle,_sheep,_and_doves.htm">Men Selling Cattle, Sheep, and Doves</a></b><br>Merchants providing animals for sacrifices, which were necessary for temple rituals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/money_changers.htm">Money Changers</a></b><br>Individuals exchanging foreign currency for the temple currency, often at a profit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was located, a central place of worship for the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_god's_house.htm">Zeal for God's House</a></b><br>Jesus' actions demonstrate a righteous zeal for the sanctity of worship.

Within the latter was the sanctuary (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), or sacred <span class="accented">adytum</span>, where the altars of sacrifice and incense faced the veil of the holiest of all. In the court of the temple had been allowed a secular market for sacrificial beasts. An exchange for money was also set up,where Jews were ready to furnish, on usurious terms, the proper coin, the sacred half shekel (value, one shilling and threepence), in which form alone was the temple tax received from the provincial visitors or pilgrims from distant lands. No coin bearing the image of Caesar, or any foreign prince, or any idolatrous symbol then so common, would be allowed in the sacred treasury. So the Lord found those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the exchangers of money sitting; a busy bazaar, deteriorating the idea of the temple with adverse associations. The three sacrificial animals mentioned were those most frequently required. The strangers, doubtless, needed some market where these could be obtained, and where the sufficient guarantee of their freedom from blemish could be secured. It was also indispensable that exchange of coins should have been made feasible for the host of strangers. The profanation effected by transacting these measures in the temple courts was symptomatic of widespread secularism, an outward indication of the corruption of the entire idea of worship, and of the selfishness and pride which had vitiated the solemnity and spirituality of the sacrificial ritual. Geikie has given a very brilliant description of this scene; so also Edersheim, 'Life of Jesus the Messiah.' The money (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) was probably derived from a word (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>) meaning "to cut," and referred to the minute coins which were required for convenient exchange. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which gives its name to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> of the following verse, is also the name of a small (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "mutilated") coin used for purposes of exchange. The smaller the coin the better, as the minute differences of weight of the foreign coins would thus be more easily measured. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
