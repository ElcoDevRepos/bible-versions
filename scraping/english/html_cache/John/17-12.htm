It highlights the period when Jesus taught, guided, and nurtured His followers. This time was crucial for the disciples' spiritual formation and understanding of Jesus' mission. The presence of Jesus among His disciples fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah dwelling among His people (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>).<p><b>I protected and preserved them by Your name</b><br>Jesus emphasizes His role as the Good Shepherd, safeguarding His disciples from spiritual harm. The "name" refers to God's authority and power, which Jesus wielded to protect His followers. This protection is reminiscent of the divine protection seen throughout the Old Testament, such as God's protection of Israel (<a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>).<p><b>the name You gave Me</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority and mission given to Jesus by the Father. The name represents God's character and essence, which Jesus embodied. It connects to the concept of Jesus being the "I AM" (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>), reflecting His divine nature and unity with the Father.<p><b>Not one of them has been lost</b><br>Jesus reassures that He has kept all His disciples safe, except for one. This reflects the security of believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>, where Jesus speaks of His sheep never being snatched from His hand. It also highlights the fulfillment of His mission to preserve those given to Him by the Father.<p><b>except the son of destruction</b><br>This refers to Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. The term "son of destruction" indicates his destined role in the divine plan. Judas' betrayal was foreseen in Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the Messiah.<p><b>so that the Scripture would be fulfilled</b><br>This phrase points to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's betrayal.

Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>. During His presence with them there was not this special need for commending them to the Father's care. His relation to them now is as that of a parent blessing and praying for His children before He is taken away from them. (Comp. <a href="/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept.</span>--Better (comp. previous verse), <span class= "ital">I kept them in Thy name which Thou gavest Me, and guarded them.</span> The pronoun is emphatic. "While I was in the world <span class= "ital">I</span> kept them. I am now praying that Thou wouldest keep them." The words "kept" and "guarded" differ slightly in meaning, the former pointing to the preservation in the truth revealed to them, and the latter to the watchfulness by means of which this result was obtained. The former may be compared to the feeding of the flock, the latter to the care which protects from the wild beasts around. (Comp. <a href="/context/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28-30</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">None of them perished, except the son of perdition.</span> The tense is the same as that of the word "guarded." The Good Shepherd watched His flock, and such was His care that none perished but the "son of perdition." Of him the words carefully state that "he perished." He, then, was included in "them which Thou gavest Me." For him there was the same preservation and the same guardianship as for those who remained in the fold. The sheep wandered from the flock, and was lost by his own act.

He speaks of the earthly ministry as completed, and reviews the whole of his influence over them. <span class="cmt_word">I kept them in thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. The very process that I can no longer pursue, and the cessation of which becomes the ground of the plea for the Father's <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. This an earthly father might say, without irreverence, of children whom he was about to leave, but the quality of the <span class="accented">keeping</span> is characterized by the Divine Name which was given him, and that manifested the Sonship which carried with it all the revelation of the Father. <span class="cmt_word">And I guarded</span> (them) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> signifies watchful observation; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, guardianship as behind the walls of a fortress - <span class="cmt_word">and not one perished</span> - went to destruction - <span class="cmt_word">except that the son of perdition</span> (has perished). Christ does not say that the son of perdition was given him by the Father and guarded from the evil one, and yet had gone to his own place; the exception refers simply to the "not one perished." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> has occasionally a meaning not exactly equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>, but expresses an exception which does not cover the whole of the ideas involved in the previous clause (see <a href="/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="/luke/4-26.htm">Luke 4:26, 27</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, etc.). This awful Hebraistic phrase is used by St. Paul (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>) for antichrist, and numerous phrases of the kind show how a genitive following <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> expresses the full characteristic or the chief feature of certain persons (thus cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). This victim of perdition, this child of hell, has completed his course; even now he has laid his plans for my destruction and his own. He has so perished <span class="cmt_word">in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> Even if the full telic force of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is preserved here, he does not free the "son of perdition" from the responsibility of his own destruction. The Scripture portraiture of Messiah has been realized. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which has already been quoted by our Lord in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, is probably still in his mind (cf. also <a href="/isaiah/57-12.htm">Isaiah 57:12, 13</a>). Some commentators - Arch-deacon Watkins, Dean Alford - press the fact that the "son of perdition" must have been among those who were given to Christ by the Father, who were watched, guarded, taught by God; but that Judas nevertheless took his own way and went to his own place. Thoma compares the lost disciple with the lost sheep of the synoptists, as though we had a reference to a true reprobate, a son of Belial, Apollyon, and the like. Moulton justly protests against any countenance being found here for the irrevocable decree. But if the interpretation of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> given above is sound, there is no inclusion of the traitor among those who are "of the truth," etc.; but he was one who, notwithstanding boundless opportunity, went to his own place in the perversity of his own will. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
