It is a unique expression found in John's writings, emphasizing the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers. The use of "little children" also indicates the disciples' need for guidance and instruction, much like children depend on a parent.<p><b>I am with you only a little while longer.</b><br>Jesus is foreshadowing His imminent departure through His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This statement is set during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative. The phrase underscores the urgency of His final teachings and the transition from His physical presence to the coming of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>You will look for Me,</b><br>This reflects the disciples' impending sense of loss and confusion after Jesus' death. Historically, the Jewish people had long awaited the Messiah, and the disciples' search for Jesus after His departure symbolizes their struggle to understand His mission and the nature of His kingdom.<p><b>and as I said to the Jews,</b><br>Jesus previously addressed the Jewish leaders and crowds with similar words, highlighting a consistent message throughout His ministry. This reference connects the disciples' experience with the broader narrative of Jesus' interactions with the Jewish people, who often misunderstood His mission.<p><b>so now I say to you:</b><br>Jesus is drawing a parallel between His earlier teachings to the Jewish leaders and His current message to the disciples. This emphasizes the universal nature of His message and the continuity of His mission, despite the different audiences.<p><b>&#8216;Where I am going, you cannot come.&#8217;</b><br>This statement points to Jesus' unique role in salvation history. His path to the cross, resurrection, and ascension is one that only He can undertake. It also alludes to the heavenly realm, which the disciples cannot yet enter.
