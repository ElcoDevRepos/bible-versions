This phrase indicates their persistent confusion and desire for clarity. In the context of <a href="/john/16.htm">John 16</a>, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His imminent departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit. Their repeated questioning shows their reliance on Jesus for understanding and guidance, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Why is He saying, &#8216;a little while&#8217;?</b><br>The phrase "a little while" is significant in the context of Jesus' impending death and resurrection. It suggests a short period of time, which can be seen as a reference to the three days between His crucifixion and resurrection. This phrase also points to the temporary nature of their separation from Jesus, as He would soon return to them after His resurrection. The disciples' confusion highlights their limited understanding of the events that were about to unfold, despite Jesus' previous teachings about His death and resurrection (e.g., <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p><b>We do not understand what He is saying.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the disciples' lack of comprehension regarding Jesus' prophetic words. It reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where the disciples often struggle to grasp the spiritual truths Jesus conveys. Their misunderstanding is not just intellectual but also spiritual, as they have yet to receive the Holy Spirit, who would later guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This moment foreshadows the clarity and understanding they would gain after Pentecost, as recorded in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, when the Holy Spirit empowers them to fully comprehend and proclaim the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His impending departure and return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are confused about His statement regarding "a little while."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus is giving His farewell teachings to His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context of <a href="/bsb/john/16.htm">John 16</a> includes Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit, who will guide the disciples into all truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion_and_resurrection.htm">The Crucifixion and Resurrection</a></b><br>The events that Jesus is alluding to when He speaks of going away and then returning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_timing.htm">Understanding God's Timing</a></b><br>God's timing often differs from our own, and His "little while" may seem long to us.

Their immediate, repeated questioning shows genuine perplexity.<p>&#8226; Earlier moments reveal the same pattern: Peter asked, &#8220;Lord, where are You going?&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>), and Thomas said, &#8220;Lord, we do not know where You are going&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a>). Like children seeking clarity from a trusted parent, they keep pressing for answers.<p>&#8226; This persistence proves their love and dependence, yet also their limited grasp of the divine timetable (cf. <a href="/luke/9-45.htm">Luke 9:45</a>; <a href="/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their example reminds us that honest questions are welcomed by the Lord; persistence in seeking truth is never rebuked (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why is He saying, &#8216;a little while&#8217;?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;A little while&#8221; points to events unfolding within hours: Jesus&#8217; arrest, crucifixion, burial, and, on the third day, His literal, bodily resurrection (<a href="/bsb/john/19.htm">John 19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; He had already promised, &#8220;Because I live, you also will live&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>). The interval would feel agonizingly long to them, yet from heaven&#8217;s vantage point it truly was &#8220;a little while&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-4.htm">Psalm 90:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, He used similar words about His ascension and eventual return (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). Scripture often compresses future hope into brief phrases, urging watchfulness (<a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, &#8220;a little while&#8221; underscores that suffering and waiting are temporary, resurrection and reunion are certain (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We do not understand what He is saying.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Their inability was not intellectual but spiritual.

Fifty days later at Pentecost, the promise was fulfilled; the once-confused disciples boldly proclaimed the risen Christ (<a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14-36</a>).<p>&#8226; This scene illustrates the difference the indwelling Spirit makes: confusion becomes conviction, fear becomes courage (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Present-day followers facing puzzling providence can trust the same Spirit to illuminate Scripture and anchor hope (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/16-18.htm">John 16:18</a> captures the disciples&#8217; repeated, heartfelt confusion about Jesus&#8217; phrase &#8220;a little while.&#8221; Their questions reveal sincere love yet limited understanding. Jesus meant a brief span between His death and resurrection, and by extension the temporary nature of all waiting until His return. Their lack of comprehension points to the necessity of the Holy Spirit, who would soon clarify everything. For us, the verse encourages persistent inquiry, patient trust in God&#8217;s timing, and reliance on the Spirit who turns bewilderment into confident faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They said, What is this little while whereof he speaketh</span>?
