He is physically close to Jesus, yet spiritually distant at this moment. The act of warming himself by the fire symbolizes his attempt to find comfort in a hostile environment. This setting is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, where the righteous are warned against standing in the way of sinners. The courtyard is a place of trial and judgment, and Peter's actions here contrast with his earlier boldness in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>).<p><b>So they asked him, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you also one of His disciples?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed to Peter is a direct challenge to his association with Jesus. This moment fulfills Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a>, where He foretold Peter's denial. The question comes from the bystanders, possibly servants or officers of the high priest, who recognize Peter as a follower of Jesus. This reflects the tension and fear among the disciples after Jesus' arrest, as they are now targets of suspicion and potential persecution.<p><b>He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's denial is a pivotal moment, highlighting human weakness and fear. Despite his earlier declarations of loyalty (<a href="/john/13-37.htm">John 13:37</a>), Peter succumbs to pressure. This denial is the second of three, emphasizing the completeness of his failure. It serves as a reminder of the need for divine strength in the face of trials. Peter's denial contrasts with Jesus' steadfastness during His own interrogation. This moment also foreshadows Peter's eventual restoration and leadership in the early church, as seen in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-19</a>, demonstrating the theme of redemption and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his boldness and later leadership in the early church.

God often tests faith through ordinary voices, not dramatic confrontations.<p>&#8226; Their wording, &#8220;also,&#8221; hints they have heard of an earlier denial (<a href="/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17</a>) and are pressing the issue. Truth keeps returning until confronted.<p>&#8226; Identity is the issue: association with Jesus marks believers (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>). Peter faces the choice every follower faces&#8212;public loyalty or self-preservation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He denied it and said, &#8220;I am not.&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;Truly I tell you,&#8221; Jesus had prophesied, &#8220;before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a>).<p>&#8226; This is denial number two (see <a href="/mark/14-68.htm">Mark 14:68-70</a>). The sin deepens; patterns solidify when unconfessed.<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s &#8220;I am not&#8221; stands in stark opposition to Jesus&#8217; repeated &#8220;I am&#8221; statements (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; 18:5-6). Fear silences witness, turning confession into contradiction.<p>&#8226; Yet grace is already at work. <a href="/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a> records that after the third denial &#8220;the Lord turned and looked at Peter.&#8221; The same Savior who foretold the failure also planned restoration (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). <a href="/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a> later shows a Spirit-filled Peter boldly proclaiming Christ&#8212;the antidote to past failure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/18-25.htm">John 18:25</a> portrays the subtle, step-by-step slide from confident loyalty to fearful denial. Peter&#8217;s need for warmth places him among scoffers, a simple question exposes divided allegiance, and a flat denial follows. Scripture&#8217;s accuracy highlights both human weakness and divine foresight, preparing the way for forgiveness and future courage. The verse warns against compromise, urges humble dependence on Christ, and assures us that failure is never final when met by the Lord&#8217;s restoring grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.</span> (Comp. <a href="/john/18-18.htm" title="And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.">John 18:18</a>.)

In startling contrast to this scene, and while Annas had completed his bad-hearted but foiled inquisition, possibly even while our Lord was being transferred from the one court to the other - an event which provided an opportunity for the searching, loving, compassionate glance which broke Peter's heart - the second and third denials of Peter were also being enacted. <span class="cmt_word">Now Simon Peter</span>, who had been challenged by the doorkeeper, <span class="cmt_word">was standing and warming himself</span> (a form of verbal construction of auxiliary verb with participle to which John is addicted, and especially in those portions of his Gospel which represent his personal composition; <a href="/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6, 9, 24, 27</a>; <a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24, 27</a>) - "standing," not "sitting," as Luke describes his position at the <span class="accented">first</span> denial, having, we might suppose, impetuously changed his position. <span class="cmt_word">They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples?</span> This sentence of John really gathers up another moment of Peter's terrible fall, variously and even discrepantly put by the synoptic narrative, and is virtually accordant with them all three. According to Matthew "another maid," according to Mark "the maid" who had first challenged him, returned to the assault. Nothing more likely than that what was said by one woman should be eagerly taken up by another, and therefore that both statements are true. Luke, however, describes the event thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "another man" (perhaps "a different person") saw him and said, "Thou art one of them." John's statement embraces the substance of all three statements, "They said unto him." The general resemblance of the second charge brought against the apostle, as stated by all four evangelists, is remarkable. The different personages by whose lips the charge was urged can best be explained by the occurrence of simultaneous and widely spreading conviction, instead of an unnecessary multiplication of the denials themselves. Matthew and Mark represent Peter as overhearing the conversation of the maids with those who were there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), showing the obvious occasion for some eager <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to take up their statement as an accusation. The difficulty of place is not so easily resolved, for Matthew and Mark speak of the "gate," <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "porch," outer hall of the court, and John of the fire where Peter first sat in apparent unconcern. We do not know how near the fire was to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it was not indeed between the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, in the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. According to Matthew he was moving towards the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, probably in the stir of the procession from the house of Annas to the court of Caiaphas. The four evangelists agree in the declaration made by Peter. <span class="cmt_word">He denied, and said, I am not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I am not one of the disciples concerning whom Annas asks. "I do not know the Man." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
