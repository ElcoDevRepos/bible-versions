In the Jewish tradition, the Torah was central to life and worship, and memorization of scripture was common. The word "abide" suggests a deep, ongoing presence, indicating that God's word should dwell within believers, influencing their thoughts and actions. This echoes <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you," emphasizing the transformative power of scripture when it truly resides within a person.<p><b>because you do not believe</b><br>Belief is a central theme in the Gospel of John, where faith in Jesus is presented as the pathway to eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The lack of belief here is not just intellectual assent but a failure to trust and commit to the truth of Jesus' identity and mission. This reflects the broader context of <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, where Jesus is addressing Jewish leaders who are skeptical of His claims and miracles. Their unbelief prevents them from understanding and accepting the deeper truths of God's revelation.<p><b>the One He sent</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus as the sent one from God, a concept rooted in the Old Testament where prophets were often described as being sent by God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is uniquely the sent one, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which Jesus reads in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-21</a>, declaring its fulfillment in Him. The sending of Jesus is a key theme in John, underscoring His divine mission and authority. This also connects to the concept of Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word becomes flesh and dwells among us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders who are questioning His authority and divinity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

They had, indeed, the word of God, but they had it not as a power ever living in them. They locked it up with sacred care in ark and synagogue, but it found no home in their inmost life, and had no real power on their practice. They could take it up and put it down. It was something outside themselves. Had it been in them, it would have produced in them a moral consciousness, which would have accepted, as of the same nature with itself, every fuller revelation from God. Their own spirits, moulded by the word of God dwelling in them, would have received the Word of God now among them. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus A: Doctrine of the Word.</span>) The fact that they believed not Him whom God <span class= "ital">sent</span> (not "hath sent") was itself the proof that they had not the abiding word. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And further, you have not his Word</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x39f;&#x39d;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x393;&#x39f;&#x39d;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3a5;&#x3a4;&#x39f;&#x3a5;</span>) abiding in you.

Some suspect a <span class="accented">petitio principii</span> in this argument, but the reasoning seems to be this; there is abundant evidence, corroboration, and cooperative glory, affirming the truth of all that Christ has said about himself as the Source of life and Judge of man; but the moral susceptibility of his hearers is paralyzed, and their faith in the most fundamental facts of their own experience is at fault.
