The Entry into Jerusalem is described by each of the evangelists, and the outer incidents are told more briefly by St. John than by any one of the others. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/21-1.htm" title="And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="/context/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,">Mark 11:1-11</a>; <a href="/context/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29-44</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">On the next day.</span>--See Note on <a href="/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>. St. John only gives us this definite note of time, connecting the Entry with the previous sojourn at Bethany. The Synoptic narrative is more general, describing the approach from Jericho, and naming Bethphage (Matt. and Luke) and Bethany (Mark and Luke) as stages in the journey, but not connecting the Supper at Bethany with the Entry. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-19.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="accented">The triumphal entry into Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented">Christ's challenge of the authorities, and its results</span>. (On the differences between John's account of this transaction and that of the synoptic narrative, cf. commentaries, <a href="/matthew/21-1.htm">Matthew 21:1-11</a>; <a href="/mark/11-1.htm">Mark 11:1-10</a>; <a href="/luke/19-29.htm">Luke 19:29-44</a>.) On the precise order of events it is difficult to speak with absolute decision. The main difference between the synoptists and John is in the break at Bethany of the journey from Jericho to Jerusalem, to introduce a feast, which is related afterwards by the synoptists, though not <span class="accented">limited</span> by them to any later chronological position. It should be observed, moreover, that the synoptic narrative contains numerous references to the residence in Bethany during several days of the week (cf. <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>) which followed. John adds important details, and while he omits the great discussions in the temple, the withering of the fig tree, the cleansing of the temple, the parables of the judgments on scribes and Pharisees, and the prophecy of the future, he portrays the inner life of the Lord, and records his most gracious esoteric teaching and sublime prayer. The current tradition of the Church, the distinct note of time for Christ's arrival at Bethany (six days before the Passover), make the triumphal entry take place on Sunday afternoon (cf. ver. 1) of Passion week. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The next day</span> (on the morrow) must be the day after the feast. We have seen that that feast probably took place on the evening of the sabbath. The events that happened are far more abundantly described in Matthew, Mark, and Luke - the excitement in Jerusalem, the method in which the triumph was carried through, the mode adopted to secure "the young ass," the weeping ever Jerusalem from the summit of the hill; none of these circumstances are inconsistent with this account. Brief, however, as our narrative is, it adds some features which are peculiar and highly historic. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">vast crowd that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> These that had come from the country, and had already encamped near or in Jerusalem, came group after group to Bethany to escort him into the city. The synoptists, not mentioning the pause of the sabbath at Bethany, and not clearly indicating where and when the feast at Bethany took place, naturally connect the journey from Jericho with the entrance into Jerusalem. John explains, in addition, that there were of the Jerusalemites themselves certain who had been led to go to Bethany and throw in their lot with the Lord. The early pilgrims mentioned in <a href="/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55, 56</a>, also came forth from the city to hail and welcome his approach. Took branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him. The synoptists had mentioned that the triumphant host had cut "branches," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>), from the trees, and Mark (<a href="/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>) had said <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, fragments of trees, grass, small branches, that could be strewn in the way. Luke (<a href="/luke/19-35.htm">Luke 19:35</a>) simply mentions the <span class="accented">garments</span> thus strewn - a fact mentioned also by Mark and Matthew. Our narrative gives greater definiteness, and even adds a new feature, by speaking of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "the palm branches of the palm trees," which they waved probably in triumph, as they had been accustomed to do in token of the approach of a conqueror (cf. 1 Macc. 13:51, where Simon's return to the city was celebrated with "thanksgiving and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> and with harps and cymbals," etc.). The use to which the branches of the well-known palm trees were put, differs from, but does not exclude, the use to which <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were also put. Bethany (see note, <a href="/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1</a>) was "the house of dates," and the palm branches for the Feast of Tabernacles, on its first celebration after the Captivity (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), Were fetched from <span class="accented">the</span> mount (<a href="/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). The palm tree was a sacred symbol for Israel "Tamar," a palm <span class="accented">tree</span>, was a favorite name for a woman. The Maccabaean coins were decorated with the palm and vine. The medal struck by Titus represented a captive sitting under a palm. Throughout their history, in their gorgeous temple ritual, it continually reappears, and at the last the Apocalypse represents the victorious songs of triumphant elders accompanied by the waving of the palm. If we compare the four accounts of the demonstration, we shall see again how in combination they vividly represent the whole scene. The multitude cry, according to - <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>: "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest." <a href="/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9, 10</a>: "Hosanna; Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David: Hosanna in the highest." <a href="/luke/19-38.htm">Luke 19:38</a>, remembering the angel's song: "They praised God with a loud voice.... Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord: in heaven peace, and glory in the highest." John says they went forth to meet him, palm branch in hand, and cried, <span class="cmt_word">Hosanna: Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, and</span> (blessed be) <span class="cmt_word">(even) the King of Israel.</span> These differences show how various groups used with freedom the tones and sentiment of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, adopting the welcome with which the priests were accustomed to greet the pilgrims to the festival. But each account demonstrates that, on this occasion, there was a general ascription to our Lord of Messianic honor. He is hailed by the people as King of Israel, as the Head of the coming kingdom of their father David, and as giving glory to God. <span class="accented">The Name of the Lord</span> is the manifestation and compendium of all the perfections of the Lord.
