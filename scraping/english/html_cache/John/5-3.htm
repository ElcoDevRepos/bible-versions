Archaeological discoveries have confirmed the existence of this pool, which had five porticoes or covered walkways. These walkways provided shelter for those seeking healing, indicating a place of hope and desperation. The location near the Sheep Gate suggests a connection to sacrificial practices, symbolizing the need for spiritual cleansing.<p><b>lay a great number of the sick</b><br>The presence of a large number of sick individuals highlights the widespread suffering and need for healing in society. This scene reflects the brokenness of humanity and the longing for restoration. It also sets the stage for Jesus' ministry, which often focused on healing as a sign of the coming Kingdom of God. The multitude of sick people underscores the compassion of Jesus, who often ministered to those marginalized by society.<p><b>the blind</b><br>Blindness in biblical times was not only a physical ailment but also carried social and spiritual implications. The blind were often marginalized and seen as cursed or sinful. Jesus' healing of the blind throughout the Gospels serves as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and the removal of spiritual blindness. It fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened in the Messianic age.<p><b>the lame</b><br>The lame, unable to walk, represent those hindered in their journey through life. In the Old Testament, lameness often symbolized spiritual weakness or imperfection. Jesus' healing of the lame, as seen in other Gospel accounts, demonstrates His power to restore both physical and spiritual wholeness. It also fulfills Messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, where the lame will leap like a deer.<p><b>and the paralyzed</b><br>Paralysis, a condition of complete immobility, symbolizes total helplessness and dependence on others. In the cultural context, the paralyzed were often seen as burdens and were socially isolated. Jesus' interaction with the paralyzed, such as in the healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof (<a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2:1-12</a>), emphasizes His authority to forgive sins and His compassion for those in desperate need. This act of healing serves as a type of spiritual awakening, where Jesus brings life and movement to those spiritually paralyzed by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate, known for its healing properties.

It is interesting to note how a gloss like this has found its way into the narrative, and, for ninety-nine out of every hundred readers, is now regarded as an integral part of St. John's Gospel. We meet with it very early. It is found in the Alexandrian MS., and in the Latin and early Syrian versions. Tertullian refers to it. This points to a wide acceptance from the second century downwards, and points doubtless to the popular interpretation of that day. It explains the man's own view in <a href="/john/5-7.htm" title="The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.">John 5:7</a>, and the fact of the multitude assembled round the pool (<a href="/john/5-3.htm" title="In these lay a great multitude of weak folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.">John 5:3</a>). The bubbling water moving as it were with life, and in its healing power seeming to convey new energy to blind and halt and lame, was to them as the presence of a living messenger of God. They knew not its constituent elements, and could not trace the law of its action, but they knew the Source of all good, who gave intellect to man and healing influence to matter, effect to the remedy and skill to the physician, and they accepted the gift as direct from Him. Scientists of the present century will smile at these Christians of the second century. The Biblical critic is glad that he can remove these words from the record, and cannot be called upon to explain them. But it may be fairly asked, which is most truly scientific--to grasp the Ultimate Cause of all, even without the knowledge of intermediate links; or to trace these links, and express them in so-called laws, and make these abstract laws lifeless representatives of the living God? There is a <span class= "ital">via media</span> which, here as elsewhere, wisdom will seek rather than either extreme. All true theology must be, in the best sense, scientific; and all true science must be, in the best sense, religious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In these</span> (porches) <span class="cmt_word">lay a multitude of sick folk, blind, lame,</span> <span class="cmt_word">withered,</span> [<span class="cmt_word">waiting for the moving of the water; for an angel went down season by season into the pool, and troubled the waters: he then that first stepped in after the troubling</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the water became whole of whatsoever disease he had].</span> The interesting gloss discussed below conveys the idea of magical cure, without moral significance, and attributes such cure to angelic ministry. This is the natural and popular explanation of the Bethesda healings, and would easily occur to a copyist who has not taken pains to use New Testament diction. Wunsche quotes from 'Chullin,' fol. 105, <span class="accented">b</span>, a testimony that "deadly qualities of water were attributed to demons, and healing ones to the angels." The crowds which gather in all countries round medicinal and intermittent springs are still unable to explain their curative quality by scientific analogies; and there is nothing more likely to have suggested itself to the mind of a copyist than the intervention of an angel. The absence from Scripture elsewhere of non-moral miracles is powerful internal reason for the lack of authenticity for the poetic gloss. The text. when deprived of this dubious gloss, loses all character that is inconsistent with the authenticity of the narrative. The close of ver. 3, "waiting for the moving of the waters," is far better attested than ver. 4, and, moreover, is consistent with John's manner, and with well ascertained matters of fact; and the clause would give authentic ground for the gloss that fellows. Hoffmann and Hengstenberg defend the passage, and believe that the angel at "the waters" in the Apocalypse betrays the same hand. But there can be no fair comparison between an historical fact and a symbolical figure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">On</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
