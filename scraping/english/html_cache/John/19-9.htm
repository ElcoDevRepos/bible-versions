This setting underscores the Roman authority over Judea and the political tension of the time. Pilate's return to the Praetorium signifies a shift from public to private questioning, highlighting the gravity of the situation. The Roman governance system allowed for such private interrogations, reflecting the legal procedures of the time.<p><b>&#8220;Where are You from?&#8221; he asked.</b><br>Pilate's question reflects a deeper inquiry into Jesus' identity, possibly influenced by the claims of Jesus' divine origin. This question is not merely about Jesus' earthly hometown but hints at the rumors of His divine nature. In the cultural context, understanding one's origin was crucial for determining authority and legitimacy. This question also echoes earlier inquiries about Jesus' identity (<a href="/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27-28</a>) and fulfills the prophetic anticipation of a Messiah with divine origins (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p><b>But Jesus gave no answer.</b><br>Jesus' silence fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant does not open His mouth in defense. This silence can be seen as a demonstration of His submission to God's will and His role as the sacrificial Lamb. In the cultural context, silence in the face of accusation could be interpreted as a sign of innocence or a refusal to dignify the question with a response. Jesus' silence also contrasts with His earlier dialogues, emphasizing the fulfillment of His mission and the inevitability of His path to the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who is presiding over the trial of Jesus.

He knew that Jesus was a Galilean before sending Him to Herod (<a href="/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6</a>).

An explanation can only be suggested; it cannot be given with any degree of certainty; but that which seems most in harmony with the position is that Pilate's question was one which to him could not be answered in reality, and therefore was not answered in appearance. The answer had, indeed, already been given (<a href="/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>), but he had treated it with the impatience which showed he could not receive it now. Not of the truth, he could not hear the voice of the Son of God, and therefore that voice did not speak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he entered the Praetorium again</span> (Jesus following him), <span class="cmt_word">and he saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? but Jesus gave him no answer.</span> Almost all commentators reject the old explanation of the question of Pilate given by Paulus, that he simply asked Jesus of his birthplace or his home. The governor was disturbed, and ready to suspect that he had on his hands some supernatural Being whom no cross could destroy - some mysterious half-human, half-Divine creature, such as filled the popular literature; and, without any spiritual insight on his own side, he enticed Jesus to give him his confidence, and entrust to his keeping some of the secret of his origin, and the source of the bitter antagonism to his claims. There was fear, curiosity, and great desire for his own sake to save the suffering Man from the clutches of his enemies. "Whence art thou? Hast thou indeed made this claim? Best thou call thyself Son of God? that God is thy proper Father; that thou art coming in the glory of heaven; that thou, in thy purple robe and bleeding form, art already seated on thy throne of judgment?" Surely all this was really conveyed by the question, for we cannot suppose that "the Jews" confined themselves to the laconic recital of the charge as here recorded. The silence of Jesus is very impressive, and we, in our ignorance, can only vaguely say what it meant. Very numerous explanations are offered. Luthardt's idea, that Christ would not give an answer which would have the effect of preventing Pilate, in his agitated state, from giving the order for his crucifixion, is stagey and unreal. Moreover, it is bound up with very questionable ethic, and suggests that Jesus is answerable for the awful sin of Pilate, from which, by a word, he might have saved him. We admit that at any moment the Lord could, if he had chosen, have smitten his foes with blindness, or delivered himself from their malice by passing through them (cf. John 12:59). They would all have fallen to the earth if he had glanced at them as he had done upon the Roman guard in Gethsemane upon that very band of men who were now so busy in wiping out the stain of their momentary panic. On other occasions, when his hour of self-deliverance and self-devotion to the Father's will had not arrived, he discomfited his enemies; but now his hour had come, and he did not shrink. All this is true, but it does not account for the refusal to answer a question like this. Doubtless the silence was as expressive as speech, and even less likely to be misunderstood. He could not have denied that he was "Son of God." He could not have affirmed it without leading Pilate to put human and heathen notions into it. But could not he, who is infinite wisdom incarnate, have given an answer which would have avoided both dangers? That, however, is practically what he did effect. The prophetic picture had foretold of him, that "like a sheep before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth;" and the previous silences of Jesus before Annas, and before the false witnesses, before Caiaphas, and Pilate himself, and before Herod, are all governed by the same rule - a refusal to save himself from malignant falsity, or tricky design, or conspicuously lying charges; but when challenged to say whether he was the Christ, whether he was the Son of God, whether he was a King, he gave the answers needed. There was some likeness between the spirit of Herod, Caiaphas, and the false witnesses, and of Pilate's "Whence art thou?" which did not deserve an affirmative answer. The governor, who had scourged and insulted an apparently defenseless man, at the very moment when he was proclaimed innocent, and now was afraid of what he had done, came into the category of the slayers of the silent Lamb. But to the next inquiry, which went down to the depths of his heart, and revealed the utter unspirituality and self-ignorance which needed response, a wondrous reply was given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eis&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
