The use of her name is significant, as it reflects the personal relationship Jesus has with His followers. In biblical times, names held deep significance and calling someone by name indicated intimacy and recognition. This echoes <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the Good Shepherd who calls His sheep by name. The personal address signifies Jesus' knowledge and care for each individual.<p><b>She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, &#8220;Rabboni!&#8221;</b><br>Mary's response indicates recognition and reverence. "Rabboni" is an Aramaic term, a dialect of Hebrew, meaning "my teacher" or "master." This term was used to address respected teachers and rabbis, showing Mary's respect and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority. The use of Aramaic highlights the cultural and linguistic context of first-century Judea, where Aramaic was commonly spoken among Jews. This moment also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' promise that His followers would see Him again (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>).<p><b>(which means &#8220;Teacher&#8221;).</b><br>The parenthetical explanation clarifies the meaning of "Rabboni" for a broader audience, indicating the Gospel's intention to reach both Jewish and Gentile readers. The term "Teacher" underscores Jesus' role as a rabbi and spiritual guide. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus is frequently referred to as a teacher, emphasizing His role in imparting divine wisdom and truth. This acknowledgment by Mary highlights the continuity of Jesus' mission and His enduring role as the source of spiritual instruction and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to Mary Magdalene outside the tomb.

She had heard in the well-known voice her own name, and it has brought back to her all the old associations.

The more general expression, "woman" (ver. 15), makes her seem to us the representative of the whole of suffering humanity, weeping over the inability to find any link of fellowship between itself and the invisible God, feeling unconsciously after the Christ and haply not finding him, weeping because hostility had obliterated him or superstition had concealed him, while all the while he is near at hand. But now Jesus stirred the affection of the living, weeping person at his side by uttering her own name in tones that thrilled her to the heart, and created the new sublime conviction that he had risen, as he said. She turned herself, as though the previous glance had been momentary and partial, and now the vision and voice blended, and she knew him. <span class="cmt_word">And saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabbouni</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is here introduced by modern editors, This word only occurs in this Gospel and the Apocalypse), <span class="cmt_word">a word</span> (the evangelist adds) <span class="cmt_word">which is to say, Master</span>. The Hebrew term - probably preserved in its Galilaean form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabbouni, rather than in the ordinary form (see Authorized Version) <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, rabboni - if strictly translated, would be "my Teacher," or "my Master," yet the personal pronoun must not be pressed. It doubtless had lost its specialty as we find in many other languages (monsieur, mein herr, "my Lord," are familiar instances). Even if the full force of the pronoun were urged, Mary's faith had not gone beyond the ideal of her devotedly loved Teacher, Friend, Master, and fell far short of the insight which even the incredulous Thomas would soon exhibit, that the Lord had put on Divine glory, and filled all things. She apparently fell in speechless, passionate affection at his feet, as the other women did shortly afterwards (see <a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>); but with the idea that now the old relations between Teacher and loving disciples would be resumed. She was in no mood answering to the doubtfulness of the disciples who desired proof of his identity, of the fact of his corporeity, before they could understand his claim to be their perpetual Guide, and his promise to be with them "unto the end of the world;" but she thought at once of the old life in Galilee. Her joy knew no bounds, but her conception of the reality of that which was revealed to her was most imperfect. It was the realization of love rather than the perception of intellect. She rushed hastily to a very limited conclusion; and she suffered an obvious correction, if not repulse, which has been interpreted in many ways. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to her,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8135;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Feminine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
