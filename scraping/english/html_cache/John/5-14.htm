The temple in Jerusalem was a central place of worship and gathering for the Jewish people, signifying a place of spiritual significance. Jesus finding the man here suggests a divine appointment, emphasizing the importance of the temple as a place of encounter with God. The temple setting also highlights the man's reintegration into religious and communal life, which he may have been excluded from due to his previous infirmity.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;See, you have been made well.</b><br>Jesus acknowledges the man's physical healing, which serves as a testament to His divine authority and power. This healing is not just a physical restoration but also a sign pointing to Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies of healing and restoration found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. The phrase underscores the completeness of the healing, indicating a transformation that goes beyond mere physical recovery.<p><b>Stop sinning,</b><br>This command suggests a link between sin and the man's previous condition, though not necessarily implying that his specific sin caused his ailment. It reflects the broader biblical theme that sin has consequences and that spiritual health is as important as physical health. Jesus' admonition aligns with the call to repentance found throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for a changed life following divine intervention.<p><b>or something worse may happen to you.&#8221;</b><br>This warning implies that spiritual consequences can be more severe than physical ailments. It serves as a reminder of the eternal implications of sin and the necessity of living a life aligned with God's will. The "something worse" could refer to spiritual death or separation from God, which is a consistent theme in biblical teachings about the consequences of sin.

There is a sadness of tone even as He says, "Behold, thou art made whole;" just as there is a sigh when He says, "Ephphatha: Be opened!"

There are limbs that had better never have moved. There are lives that had better have sunk in the negative inaction of death, than have cursed themselves and others in positive deed and speech and thought of life. The power of existence is of infinite grandeur, but it is also of infinite responsibility. It has within its reach the highest good for self and for mankind; but if the God-given power is sacrificed to sin there is within its reach an unutterable depth of woe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span> (see ver. 1). Westcott thinks that a looser connection between the foregoing and subsequent events is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> than by the expression <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>.. Consequently, the persecution referred to in the remainder of the chapter may have occurred several days after the foregoing conversation. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus found</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> <span class="cmt_word">in the temple.</span> Some have inferred from this, the recognition by the healed man of the hand of God in his cure, and his desire to express his gratitude in the house of God by some appropriate conduct or service; and, granting this explanation, much charm is observable in the tact that Jesus found him. and found him there. The Lord's habit of visiting the temple, and the penetrating glance which he casts over all the frequenters of his Father's house might then fairly be deduced from the passage; but the motive of the man is quite conjectural. From the words of Jesus one might as reasonably suppose that the man was treading at the time on dangerous moral ground, making some kind of gain from his notoriety. The healing was, at least, imperfect until the man had learned its spiritual significance. Every gift of God is doubled in value when its source is recognized. God's signature on his own mercies gives them their true meaning. Christ found the healed man in the precincts of the temple, whether his motive was pure or mixed in going thither. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Beheld, thou art made whole</span> (hast become sound and healthy throughout thy physical system; cf. for the form of this description of his case, the query, ver. 6): <span class="cmt_word">no longer continue to sin.</span> The form of the sentence points to something special and persistent in this man's habits, rather than to the general corruption of human nature. Christ's penetrating glance discovered all the hidden misery and bleeding wound and putrefying sore of the man's soul. Apart from the obliteration of the consequences of his bad life, and without a clean and free condition of things, the future would have proved hopeless, and deliverance from the yoke of fear and concupiscence impossible; but now this new chance is given. He was made whole, born again physically. As Naaman's flesh became like that of a little child, so this man - once bent, crippled, distorted by his self-indulgence, and now made whole - is to "sin no longer." It would not be reasonable to conclude from this that Christ's doctrine, like that of Job's friends, involved the indissoluble connection of sin with sickness, or made the amount of pain in any case the criterion of individual sin. Our Lord repudiates this position in <a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> and in <a href="/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-5</a>; but special calamities have unquestionably followed wrong doing, and can, in many instances, be referred to obvious transgressions, to specific acts, or inveterate habits. The man's own conscience would respond to the charge. Jesus added: <span class="cmt_word">Lest a worse thing befall thee.</span> There is, then, something worse than thirty-eight years of apparently hopeless wretchedness! Jesus said, even as reported by the apostle of love, the most terrible things that ever fell from human lips. The "sin no longer" makes it seem as though man's will could accomplish much (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>, "Cease," etc.), and as though all the future of our life were, so far as human responsibility goes, dependent upon ourselves. We are to act as if it were. Let it be noticed that he who said, "Sin no more," said, "Rise up, take thy bed, and walk." Three things, which appeared utterly beyond the power of the impotent man, were, nevertheless, done by him through the grace of Christ, which he then and there appropriated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Afterward,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">found</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(heuriskei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the man]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
