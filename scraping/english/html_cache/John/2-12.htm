It was on the shore of the lake of Tiberias, and He must have gone "down" to it from any locality among the hills of Galilee. The words do not imply that they went to Capernaum direct from Cana. The "after this" allows of a return to Nazareth, and the mention of the "brethren" makes such a return probable. The place of this sojourn in the order of events belongs to the narrative of the earlier Gospels, and here, as elsewhere, questions which recur are treated when they are first mentioned. To deal with them on each occurrence would be to save the trouble of reference at the cost of much space; and this would be ill-saved; the spiritual profit arising from constant reference is one which no earnest student of the Gospels could desire to lose. He will wish to study every event in that life in every word which records it.

Three competing sites for this small town have been advocated by Eastern travellers; all of them on the shore of the lake, all near to Bethsaida and Chorazin, in "the way of the sea," combining more or less the characteristics required by the New Testament narrative and the references in Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:10, 8). Keim is in favour of <span class="accented">Khan, Minyeh</span>; but there is no abundant spring such as Josephus describes, nor are there any ruins which indicate an extensive town. Caspari has argued in favour of <span class="accented">Ain Mudawarah</span>, a mile and a half to the west of <span class="accented">Khan Minyeh</span>, in which, though water is abundant, there are no remains of buildings. The old travellers, and the most recent explorations, have coincided in fixing on <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> as the site; and Dr. Farrar, Dr. Westcott, Major Wilson, incline to this conclusion. Abundant ruins are found there, and, what is more than probable, the remains of the very synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one certainly dating back to the Herodian age. <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span>, or "the Mound of Hum," is an easy corruption of the <span class="accented">Caphar</span>, or village of <span class="accented">Nahum. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples.</span> They may have returned home to Nazareth, though some recent commentators suggest that Cana had become the home of his family in late years. This is contradicted by the express statement of ch. 1:45, and the utter obliteration of the name of Cana from the synoptic narrative. We cannot identify this possible return to Nazareth with the account in <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-20</a>, because it assumes a previous period of activity in Capernaum, and further, because the commencement of Christ's public ministry is expressly made synchronous with the imprisonment of the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-15</a>), which did not take place till weeks or months afterwards (<a href="/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). Consequently, this journey to Capernaum preceded the journey to Jerusalem and the return to Nazareth, of which Matthew speaks. The fact that "the mother and brethren "of Jesus accompanied him, but not "the sisters," suggests what is implied in <a href="/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> that the sisters were married in Nazareth and in <a href="/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21-23</a> that they did not accompany the non-believing brothers in their endeavour "to lay hold of him." The fact that Joseph is not mentioned induces the common assumption that he was already dead. Volumes have been written on "the brethren of Jesus." The determination of their parentage is one of the most perplexing points in the evangelic history. There are three hypotheses, which are alike beset with difficulties. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The view propounded by Helvidius in Rome, in the fourth century, and to which Jerome replied, that the "brothers" are brothers in the ordinary sense, children of Joseph and Mary. This supposition is sustained by the statement of <a href="/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a> and <a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>, each of which implies that the mother of our Lord had other children. The sentiment of the Church in favour of Mary's perpetual virginity, and in favour of the uniqueness of her maternity, has powerfully contested this supposition. Further, apart from any sentiment, it has been said that the Lord would not have commended the mother to the beloved disciple, if he had living brothers who had a previous claim. To this, however, it is replied that John, the son of Zebedee and Salome, may have been his near relative, if Salome were the sister of the Virgin; and also that, up to the time of the Ascension, there is no proof that the brethren believed in him, but the contrary. The effect of a special manifestation to James (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.) may have led to a general admission of the brethren, who are distinguished from, but yet <span class="accented">with</span>, the eleven apostles and the mother on the eve of the Ascension (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> To obviate the difficulties of a sentimental kind, it was suggested by Jerome, and it has been often assumed since, that these brothers were in reality <span class="accented">first cousins</span>, not the children of Salome the sister of the Virgin, but of Mary the wife of Cleophas, who is supposed to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus (see ch. 20:25, note), and further that this Cleophas = Clopas = <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> = Alphaeus = Chalphai for the Aramaic guttural might be omitted as in Alphseus, or turned into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;</span> in <span class="accented">Clopas</span>, found in John's text. Jerome, however (Lightfoot), never referred to this confirmation of his theory; but it has been hence conjectured that James the son of Alphaeus was identical with the celebrated "James the brother of our Lord," mentioned in <a href="/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; in <a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 12</a>; and in ecclesiastical history. If, however, this James were the "son of Alphaeus," then <span class="accented">Judas</span> (<a href="/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>) (not Iscariot) - "Judas of James" (<a href="/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 1:13) - was also one of the "brethren;" also Joses and Simon, sons of Cleophas, were of their number; and some have gone further, and made Simon the Canaanite the other brother. This might possibly be the solution of the puzzle, if the entire theory did not break down under the clear distinction drawn in evangelic narrative between the twelve apostles and the brethren. <span class="accented">E.g.</span> in this passage they are discriminated from "disciples." In <a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a> the "brethren" are said not to believe on the Lord. In <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> they are mentioned in addition to the apostles. Though in <a href="/galatians/1.htm">Galatians 1</a> and 2, James might seem from his great eminence to be classed with apostles in some wider sense, yet in <a href="/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> he seems to take precedence of <span class="accented">all the</span> apostles, at the Council of Jerusalem, and in presidency of the Church there. Moreover, the identification of Cleophas with Alphaeus is very doubtful. Clopas is Aramaic, Cleophas a Greek name; and the identification of his wife Mary with the sister of the Virgin is also very doubtful; while to have two sisters of the same name in the same family is highly improbable. We cannot believe, further, that so distinguished a man as James the brother of our Lord could have been designated as "James the Less" in the evangelic narrative (<a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>). If the "cousin theory" holds, this must have been the case. Finally, "cousins" would hardly so persistently have been spoken of as <span class="accented">brothers</span>, and this would be still less likely if their mother was living. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The third hypothesis, which is the suggestion of Epiphanius, is that these brothers were the children of Joseph by a previous marriage, to whom the blessed Virgin had acted the part of mother. This is based on a legend of the apocryphal 'Protevang. of James' (ch. 9. and 17.), where Joseph speaks of his "sons." The theory saves the virginity of Mary, but sacrifices that of Joseph. Such a conclusion, in some ecclesiastic circles, is almost as unwelcome as the former. Against Jerome's hypothesis the greatest number of difficulties present themselves, and it must be abandoned. Therefore the choice really lies between that of Helvidius  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went down</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#946;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(kateb&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2597.htm">Strong's 2597: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go down, come down, either from the sky or from higher land, descend.
