The garden, located on the Mount of Olives, was a place Jesus often visited with His disciples. Peter's impulsive action of drawing his sword and striking the servant of the high priest (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>) reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission. Jesus' rebuke emphasizes His commitment to non-violence and His submission to God's will. The sword symbolizes human efforts to control or resist divine plans, contrasting with Jesus' path of peace and sacrifice.<p><b>Jesus said to Peter.</b><br>Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, often acted impulsively, as seen in his earlier declaration of unwavering loyalty (<a href="/john/13-37.htm">John 13:37</a>). His actions here reflect a common expectation among the disciples that the Messiah would establish a political kingdom. Jesus' correction serves as a teaching moment, redirecting Peter's understanding of the nature of His kingdom, which is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><b>Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?</b><br>The "cup" is a metaphor for the suffering and death Jesus is about to endure. This imagery is rooted in Old Testament passages where the cup represents God's wrath and judgment (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jesus' willingness to "drink the cup" signifies His obedience to the Father's will, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. This phrase highlights Jesus' role as the sacrificial Lamb, willingly taking on the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). His submission contrasts with human resistance, underscoring His divine mission and the necessity of His sacrifice for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to be arrested and crucified.

This is the only instance of the occurrence of this familiar imagery in St. John. St. Peter's act is one of opposition to what Jesus Himself knew to be the will of the Father. There is in the words a tender trustfulness which robs the cup of all its bitterness--"The cup which My Father hath given Me." They are, as it were, an echo of the prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, which is not recorded by St. John. It is the Father to whom He has prayed, and solemnly committed the disciples (John 17); the Father whose presence never leaves Him (<a href="/john/16-32.htm" title="Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.">John 16:32</a>); the Father into whose hands He is about from the cross to commend His Spirit (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - In Christ's reply there is no mention made of the miracle which followed, and yet the narrative is incomplete without it. Something must have restrained the baud and the high priest's own temple-watch from at once arresting Peter, if not the entire group. The characteristic touch, descriptive of our Lord's most Divine compassion, is in itself valuable, but it also accounts for the immunity of Peter. The solemn rebuke of Peter is full of Divine meaning, and is another link with the synoptic narrative of the agony. "Put up," or more literally, <span class="cmt_word">Cast the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sword into its sheath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the classical word; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> more generally used of repository, receptacle, sepulcher, etc.); or into its hiding-place; bury it away (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in Matthew). Matthew adds a memorable saying, but is silent as to the deep Divine reason of the submission of our Lord to his fate. <span class="cmt_word">The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it</span>? This imagery recalls the Passion, through which we learn from the synoptists that our Lord had passed into a Divine patience and submission to the will of God (<a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). The use of this most remarkable phraseology recalls that which John too had heard from his lips in the sweat of his agony, and of which he and Peter were the principal witnesses. The supplementary character of the Gospel, though by no means sufficient to account for all the omissions and additions of this narrative, yet does explain very much. "Jesus is now of his own accord at the disposal of his enemies; his words have put a stop to all further steps taken for his defense" (Moulton).
