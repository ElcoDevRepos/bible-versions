This indicates the growing interest in Jesus' message beyond the Jewish community, foreshadowing the spread of the Gospel to the Gentile world. This moment is significant as it aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Messiah is described as a light to the nations.<p><b>among those who went up to worship</b><br>The phrase suggests that these Greeks were participating in Jewish religious practices, likely attending the Passover festival in Jerusalem. This highlights the inclusive nature of the Jewish faith at the time, which allowed Gentiles to worship the God of Israel. It also sets the stage for the later inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius.<p><b>at the feast</b><br>The feast referred to is the Passover, one of the major Jewish festivals that commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. This event draws large crowds to Jerusalem, including Jews from the Diaspora and interested Gentiles. The timing is significant as it is during this festival that Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection occur, fulfilling the typology of the Passover lamb as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, where Christ is described as our Passover lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/greeks.htm">Greeks</a></b><br>These were likely Gentile converts to Judaism or God-fearers who were interested in the Jewish faith.
