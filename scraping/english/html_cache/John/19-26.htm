The scene takes place at the crucifixion, a pivotal moment in Christian theology. The presence of Mary fulfills the prophecy of Simeon in <a href="/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a>, where he foretold that a sword would pierce her soul. The "disciple whom He loved" is a unique designation found in John's Gospel, emphasizing a special relationship with Jesus. This moment underscores the personal and relational aspects of Jesus' ministry, even in His final hours.<p><b>He said to His mother, &#8220;Woman, here is your son.&#8221;</b><br>Addressing Mary as "Woman" is not disrespectful but rather a term of endearment and respect in the cultural context of the time. Jesus' words signify a transfer of responsibility, entrusting the care of His mother to John. This act reflects the importance of familial duty and care within the Jewish tradition, as well as the broader Christian principle of community and support. It also symbolizes the formation of a new spiritual family, united not by blood but by faith in Christ. This moment can be seen as a type of Jesus' provision and care for His followers, ensuring they are not left alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being crucified at this moment.

No atom of disrespect or failure of affection is evinced, nor can we conceive it possible that our Lord was here separating himself in his mediatorial character from all relationship with the mother who bore him! This view, adopted by Hengstenberg in part, by Steinmeyer, Luthardt, Alford, and originally by Professor Hoffmann of Erlangen, seems utterly inconsistent with the spirit of Christ. True, he had warned her not to intrude upon his modes of activity (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>), and had said that his disciples were his brothers, sisters, mother; but the greatness of his heart is human to the last. No Monophy-site explanation of the status majestaticus, no Nestorian severance of the Divine and human Christ, is needed. Christ yearned over the mother whose heart was being pierced by his agony, and with filial anxiety entrusted her, not to those brothers of his - whatever was the degree of their relationship to him - who, nevertheless, did not believe on him, but to the disciple whom he loved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
