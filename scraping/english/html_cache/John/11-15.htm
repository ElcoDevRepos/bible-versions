It reflects His teaching method, which often involved allowing circumstances to unfold in a way that would strengthen their faith. This approach is consistent with His overall ministry, where He used parables and real-life situations to reveal deeper truths.<p><b>I am glad I was not there</b><br>Jesus expresses a counterintuitive gladness, which highlights His divine perspective. His absence allowed for a greater demonstration of His power over death, which would not have been possible if He had healed Lazarus before he died. This aligns with the theme of God's timing being perfect, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the story of Joseph in Genesis.<p><b>so that you may believe</b><br>The purpose of Jesus' actions is to deepen the disciples' faith. This is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, where belief is central (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>). The miracle of raising Lazarus serves as a sign pointing to Jesus' identity as the Son of God and foreshadows His own resurrection, reinforcing the belief in His divine authority.<p><b>But let us go to him.&#8221;</b><br>This invitation to go to Lazarus signifies Jesus' willingness to confront death and sorrow, demonstrating His compassion and power. It also sets the stage for the miracle that will follow, which serves as a pivotal moment in His ministry. The journey to Bethany, where Lazarus was, is significant as it was near Jerusalem, a place of increasing danger for Jesus, showing His courage and commitment to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about the death of Lazarus.

(<a href="/john/13-7.htm">John 13:7</a>).<p>&#8211; The lesson: even painful delays serve a redemptive purpose for those who love Him (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am glad</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;I am glad&#8221; may sound surprising in the face of a friend&#8217;s death, yet Jesus rejoices because a greater revelation of His glory is about to unfold, similar to His joy when the Father&#8217;s will is advancing (<a href="/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>).<p>&#8211; His gladness is anchored in the certain outcome of resurrection power that will strengthen faith, not in the sorrow itself (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was not there</b><p>&#8211; By saying He was glad He &#8220;was not there,&#8221; Jesus highlights a deliberate choice to delay (<a href="/john/11-6.htm">John 11:6</a>).<p>&#8211; He had healed from a distance before (<a href="/john/4-50.htm">John 4:50&#8211;53</a>), so His absence was intentional, designed to allow Lazarus&#8217;s death and thus demonstrate a mightier sign.<p>&#8211;

His gladness rests in the coming display of resurrection power. By inviting the disciples to go with Him, He calls them&#8212;and us&#8212;to trust His timing, walk into hard places with Him, and believe more deeply when His glory is revealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.</span>--The words are at first sound startling, as following immediately upon the plain statement, "Lazarus is dead." The utterance is not of sorrow, but of joy; but the joy is not at the fact of death, but at the fact that He was not there. Had He been there, Lazarus would not have died (<a href="/john/11-21.htm" title="Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.">John 11:21</a>; <a href="/john/11-32.htm" title="Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.">John 11:32</a>), and his recovery would have added to the work of healing. There is the assured consciousness of power over death itself, which sees as present all that is to follow, and sees in the strengthening of their faith ground for joy.<p><span class= "bld">To the intent ye may believe.</span>--They were already disciples, but this sign would be to them the vehicle of a higher spiritual truth, and the growth of their spiritual life would be such that it may be regarded as a new act of faith. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Nevertheless let us go unto him.</span>--The thought of the final issue of the sleep brings the whole future before the mind. But for this, His presence is needed at Bethany, and He abruptly breaks off this conversation about it, by what is at once a resolution and a summons to go there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I rejoice that I was not there</span>. Death could not have occurred in his presence; at least, as Bengel says, we never read of any one dying in the presence of the Prince of life. Whenever he came into contact with death, he conquered the great enemy. Still, this was not the absolute reason for his gladness. The gladness was conditioned by the need of the disciples, not merely for the comfort of the sisters, or for his own greater glory, <span class="cmt_word">but for your sakes, to the end that ye might believe</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> is often used absolutely (<a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 50</a>; <a href="/john/4-41.htm">John 4:41, 42</a>; <a href="/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>; <a href="/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36</a>; and many other places). The disciples had believed something of Christ's power before (see <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>, etc.); but every act of faith prepares the way for another. Every fresh exercise of faith makes all previous efforts in the same direction appear elementary (cf. <a href="/1_john/5-13.htm">1 John 5:13</a>, T.R.). The joy of Jesus in the augmenting faith of his disciples is one of the most pathetic and instructive features of this Gospel (see <a href="/john/16-31.htm">John 16:31</a>, and notes). The kingdom of God among men was, so far as we can see, dependent on the amount of faith that the apostles could be induced to cherish in the fact of the Incarnation during the brief period of this ministry. The Church has not yet come to a full understanding of all that he was. But if the disciples had not known his power over death, they would have been destitute of the alphabet of this new language, of the foundations of the spiritual city they had to build. Jesus rejoiced when disciples believed. So he does still. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless, let us go to him</span> - to Lazarus, who still lives with God (cf. <a href="/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>, and parallel passages). This is very remarkable.
