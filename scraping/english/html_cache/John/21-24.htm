John was one of the twelve apostles and part of Jesus' inner circle, along with Peter and James. His close relationship with Jesus is evident throughout the Gospel, where he is often referred to as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."<p><b>who testifies to these things</b><br>John's role as a witness is crucial. In the Jewish legal system, the testimony of witnesses was essential for establishing truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). John's firsthand experience with Jesus lends credibility to his account. His testimony includes the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, which are central to Christian faith.<p><b>and who has written them down.</b><br>The act of writing was significant in the ancient world, as it preserved teachings and events for future generations. John's Gospel was likely written towards the end of the first century, providing a theological reflection on Jesus' life. The written word serves as a permanent record, ensuring that the message of Jesus could be disseminated widely and accurately.<p><b>And we know that his testimony is true.</b><br>This statement underscores the reliability of John's account. The use of "we" suggests a community affirmation, possibly from the early church or a group of John's disciples, attesting to the truthfulness of his Gospel. This assurance of truth is vital for faith, as it aligns with Jesus' own declaration of being "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).

The verse assures us that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are historical realities, faithfully preserved in Scripture so that we can believe and have life in His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things.</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30-31</a>. As we have there the formal close of what seems to have been the original Gospel, we have here the formal close of the epilogue. The words are, however, too wide to be limited to the epilogue, and clearly refer to all that has preceded. They identify the writer with the disciple just mentioned, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the disciple whom Jesus loved, and the form of the sentence implies that he who wrote these things was still living, and bearing witness to their truth. He is still testifying to the things of which he wrote.<p><span class= "bld">And we know that his testimony is true.</span>--Our first and natural thought is that these are not the words of the writer of the Gospel, but the additional witness of persons knowing him and testifying to his writing. It is usual to explain the "we know" by referring to <a href="/context/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1John 5:18-20</a>; but the plural of a letter ought not to be quoted to explain the plural in an historic document, and it is probable that the natural thought is the true one. But though the words are an addition, they are a contemporaneous addition present in every important MS. and version, and an undoubted part of the original text. We cannot tell who are the persons whose words we here read--Andrew it may be, or Philip, or some of the seventy disciples who had been witnesses of the work of Christ, or some of the Ephesian Church, as Aristion or John the Presbyter, who felt that the Apostle's personal character gave the stamp of truth to all he said, and add here the conviction that all these words were true.

He is still testifying. He has not yet departed. He still proclaims his gospel of the love of God, his memories of "the Word made flesh," of "the Light of the world," his doctrine of the "eternal life which was with the Father, and has been manifested unto us." <span class="cmt_word">And wrote these things</span> - compare "these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full" (<a href="/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and we know</span> (as a matter of fact, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that his testimony is true</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), "veracious." We know him; we believe in his representation; we know without any shadow of doubt upon our mind that what he has said answers to the fact. It does not need that any of the elders should have seen the Lord to justify the use of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Meyer supposes that these words, notwithstanding their plural form, simply show that John identifies himself with his readers, and, from the peculiar delicacy of his mind, hides himself and his individuality among them or behind them. Alford compares it with <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We have seen his glory," and <a href="/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14, 16</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-18.htm">1 John 5:18</a>. Chrysostom and Theophylact read, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>," I indeed know that his testimony is true." This ingenious method is rejected by modern scholars, on the principle that the writer would not thus have passed from third person to first. This does not seem to be insuperable: Paulus adopted this solution. The chief difficulty of admitting that these words are a note by the Ephesian presbyters, and of ignoring Chrysostom's suggestion, is that ver. 25 contains an unquestionable reintroduction of the first person in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This difficulty is, however, surmounted by Meyer, on the supposition that the last verse is not Johannine. Meyer and Tischendorf (who excludes it from his text) suppose it to have been a gloss by later hands, one which departs from the gravity and dignity of an apostle by its strong hyperbole. Still no codex but the Sinaitieus omits it, and the omission may be due to the loss of the last folio, on which it may have been written; while every other codex contains it. Godet thinks the writer was one of the elders who had joined in the previous authentication, and refers to "the strange notice which Tischendorf records from a manuscript in the Vatican, that Papias was the secretary to whom John dictated the entire Gospel," and imagines that the hyperbolic style of sores of the extant fragments of Papias might account for the extravagance of the statement it contains. Lange and Alford regard the whole verse, together with ver. 24, as Johannine, and suppose that John here speaks in propria persona when the fullness of his memory baffled all expression. Some treat the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., as a possible saying of John's which was added by the authors of both verses. We think that the presence of the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (a very unusual word in the New Testament) is possibly accounted for by the recollection which some of those who had often heard the beloved apostle speak may have had of his way of describing the superlative richness of the life of our Lord, and that the brief appendix by those who bore this testimony to the veracity and authenticity and apostolic origin of the whole narrative is of priceless value. Undoubtedly it asserts with perfect clearness that John the son of Zebedee was the author of the Gospel. If, nevertheless, the work be that of a forger, who secured an accomplice in his deed of imposition, he is a moral anomaly; for, while acting so unworthily, he was nevertheless glorifying the doctrine that God is true, and that every lie is of the devil (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>), and has produced a work which turns from end to end on a realization of the truth.
