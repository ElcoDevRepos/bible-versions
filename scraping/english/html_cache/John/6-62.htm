It implies a future event that will test their faith. The context is Jesus addressing the skepticism of His followers after His teaching on being the Bread of Life. This question serves to provoke thought about their current disbelief and how it will be challenged by future events.<p><b>if you see the Son of Man</b><br>"Son of Man" is a title Jesus frequently uses for Himself, emphasizing both His humanity and His divine authority. It connects to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory. This title underscores Jesus' role in God's redemptive plan and His authority to speak on heavenly matters.<p><b>ascend to where He was before?</b><br>This refers to Jesus' ascension into heaven, which is recorded in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. It points to His pre-existence and divine origin, affirming His deity. The ascension is a pivotal event that confirms Jesus' return to the Father and His exaltation. It also foreshadows the promise of His return, as mentioned in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.

The margin refers to the more formal statement of this in <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>. The reader should also compare <a href="/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>, where the Ascension is again assumed, and <a href="/context/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9-10</a>. Comments on these incidental references by St. John to an event he does not record have been made too frequently without noting that, in each case, the speaker is Jesus, to whose thoughts this end of subjection to earthly laws, in subjecting them to Himself, was ever present. St. John, in his own narrative, nowhere mentions the fact of the Ascension, nor does he in any way refer to it. That he could write these words without doing so is an assurance of his own knowledge of the glorious sequel of the Resurrection, and of its unquestioned acceptance in the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 62.</span> - <span class="accented">If</span> it does put difficulties in your way, then how will it be <span class="cmt_word">if you behold the Son of man ascending up to where he was before?</span> This unfinished and ambiguous sentence and query have been variously interpreted. Some have argued that our Lord here simply refers to the "resurrection;" that he told his hearers they would have an opportunity of observing that, after death, he would return to where he was before, that is, to the conditions of earthly life. The striking antithesis between "descending from" and "ascending" almost compels the repudiation of this view. Did Christ, however, mean to ask them whether, under the new condition of things, all ground of offence would not be taken away? or to imply that their faith would have to be put to a still greater strain, and that they would stumble at length irretrievably? Lucke, De Wette, Kuinoel, Meyer, chiefly urge the latter, and on the ground: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That in John's Gospel the death of Christ is always looked at as his real glorification, and that therefore by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, he was referring in his euphemistic fashion to his death in the true Johannine phrase as a going to God (cf. <a href="/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3</a>, a return to the Father; 14; 16:5, 28). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That John does not describe the Ascension as a physical fact. Meyer does not allow that <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a> and John 20:17 are sufficient with this phrase to justify such a reference to the great event referred to by Mark, Luke, and Paul, and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Against Meyer and those who agree with him it should be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is never used for "death" of Christ. The phrases, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., are used for this purpose. Moreover, when a phrase was wanted to denote the twofold idea of uplifting on the cross and ascension to the skies, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is the word twice used in the Fourth Gospel (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>; <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32-34</a>). Moreover, if death could be realized as such a <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of glory and fulness of life, the offence of the cross, and scandal of participation in and dependence upon the flesh and blood of Christ, would be reduced and not augmented. To Meyer's objection that these Galilaean disciples would not see the ascending Christ, and therefore the supposition would be tantalizing, it is sufficient to reply <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, in a similar sense, there was no reason to suppose they would see the Lord suffer and die upon the cross;  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-62.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
