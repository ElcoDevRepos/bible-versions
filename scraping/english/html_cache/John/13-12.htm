In the cultural context of the time, foot washing was a task typically reserved for the lowest servant in a household, as feet would become dirty from walking on dusty roads. Jesus, the Master and Teacher, takes on this role, symbolizing His mission to serve and cleanse humanity from sin. This act prefigures His ultimate act of service on the cross. It also fulfills the prophecy of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who humbles Himself for the sake of others.<p><b>and put on His outer garments</b><br>After washing the disciples' feet, Jesus resumes His position by putting on His outer garments. This action signifies a return to His role as Teacher and Lord, having completed the task of a servant. It reflects the dual nature of Christ as both servant and sovereign. The outer garments can symbolize the glory and authority of Christ, which He temporarily set aside to perform this humble act, much like His incarnation where He set aside divine privileges to become human (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<p><b>He reclined with them again</b><br>Reclining at the table was the customary posture for dining in the ancient Near East, especially during a formal meal like the Passover. This setting emphasizes the intimacy and fellowship Jesus shares with His disciples. It also foreshadows the future Messianic banquet, where believers will recline with Christ in the Kingdom of God (<a href="/luke/22-16.htm">Luke 22:16</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). The act of reclining signifies rest and communion, themes central to the Gospel message.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Do you know what I have done for you?&#8221;</b><br>This question invites the disciples to reflect on the deeper meaning of Jesus' actions. It is not merely about physical cleanliness but about spiritual cleansing and the call to emulate His example of humility and service. This moment is a teaching opportunity, urging the disciples to understand the significance of servant leadership. It connects to Jesus' earlier teachings on greatness in the Kingdom of God, where the greatest must be the servant of all (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>).
