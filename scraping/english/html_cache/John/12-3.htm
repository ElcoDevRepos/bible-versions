The act of taking a pint of expensive perfume signifies a significant sacrifice, as such perfumes were costly and often reserved for special occasions. The perfume, identified as pure nard, was imported from the Himalayan region, indicating its high value and rarity. This act of generosity and devotion is a reflection of Mary's deep love and reverence for Jesus, contrasting with the materialistic concerns of others, such as Judas Iscariot, who later criticizes her actions.<p><b>made of pure nard</b><br>Nard, or spikenard, is a fragrant oil derived from the root of the nard plant, native to India. Its purity indicates that it was unadulterated and of the highest quality, making it extremely valuable. In biblical times, nard was used in the preparation of incense and perfumes and was often associated with kingship and burial practices. This connection foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial, highlighting Mary's prophetic insight into His mission.<p><b>and she anointed Jesus&#8217; feet</b><br>Anointing was a common practice in ancient times, often signifying consecration or preparation for a special purpose. By anointing Jesus' feet, Mary demonstrates humility and devotion, as feet were considered the dirtiest part of the body. This act prefigures Jesus' own washing of the disciples' feet, emphasizing servanthood and love. Anointing also has messianic implications, as the term "Messiah" means "Anointed One," pointing to Jesus' divine role and mission.<p><b>and wiped them with her hair</b><br>In Jewish culture, a woman's hair was considered her glory and was usually kept covered in public. By using her hair to wipe Jesus' feet, Mary displays an intimate and personal act of worship, disregarding social norms and potential criticism. This act of vulnerability and devotion underscores the depth of her faith and love for Jesus, serving as a model for believers in their own expressions of worship and surrender.<p><b>And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume</b><br>The spreading fragrance symbolizes the far-reaching impact of Mary's act of worship. Just as the scent permeated the house, the story of her devotion has permeated the Christian narrative, serving as an enduring testament to the power of sacrificial love. This imagery also evokes the idea of Christ's sacrificial death, which brings a "fragrance" of salvation to the world, as referenced in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>, where believers are described as the "aroma of Christ."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>Sister of Martha and Lazarus, known for her devotion to Jesus.

It may perhaps mean "Nard Pistik," or Pistik ointment, the word Pistik being a local name. The fact that this peculiar word occurs only in these two passages points to this as the probable explanation.<p><span class= "bld">And anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair.</span>--St. Matthew and St. Mark both state that she anointed His head. This was the usual custom (comp. Note on <a href="/luke/7-46.htm" title="My head with oil you did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.">Luke 7:46</a>, and <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>); but St. John remembers that the act of love went beyond that of common esteem, in the depth of its gratitude and reverence, and anointed the feet, and wiped them with her own hair. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mary therefore took a pound</span> (the synoptists Matthew and Mark say "an alabaster," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a flask made of the costly spar, which was peculiarly adapted to the preservation of liquid perfume, hermetically sealed before it was broken for immediate use. The fact, as stated by Matthew and Mark, is inconsistent with her reserving any of the precious fluid for another occasion) <span class="cmt_word">of ointment</span> ("liquid perfume," sometimes added to the more ordinary oil), <span class="cmt_word">of pure</span> (or possibly; <span class="accented">pistie</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>nard</span>. Mark uses this unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which belongs to later Greek. The derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, equivalent to "potable," is not appropriate in meaning, though this "nard" was used for perfuming wine. In <a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a> also the Authorized Version translates it "spikenard," as it does here (cf. also <a href="/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a> and Song 4:13, 14, where Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). But the one place where the word was supposed to be found in Aristotle is now seen not to be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, trustworthy, or unadulterated. It is possible that the word may have had a local geographical value, belonging to some proper name, and is untranslatable. <span class="cmt_word">Very precious.</span> Mark (<a href="/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>) uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, and Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. John appears to combine the idea of both words in his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Each of the synoptists severally mentions a fact which John omits - that Mary <span class="accented">broke</span> the alabaster box, and poured the costly unguent on his head in rich abundance, as though hers had been the royal or high-priestly anointing (cf. <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>.); but John shows that this at least was not all she did. <span class="cmt_word">She anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</span> Thoma thinks that, conformably with John's idea, the anointing of the head of the true High Priest was the work of God alone, quoting Philo's comment on <a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, etc., "The head of the Logos, as High Priest, is anointed with oil, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his innermost essence gleams with dazzling light;" and adds, that as the feet of the high priest were washed with water from recent defilement of the world's dust, so God's anointed Lamb and Priest was anointed on his feet with the spikenard of faith, the best and costliest thing that man could offer. So profound an analogy seems to us contrary to the simplicity of the narrative, which is perfectly natural in its form. The perfumed nard ran down to the Savior's feet and the skirts of his garments, and there accumulating, the significant act is further recounted how Mary wiped off the superfluous perfume from his feet with the tresses of her loosened hair. This simple act proclaimed the self-humiliation and adoration of her unbounded love, seeing that the loosening of a woman's hair was a mark of unusual self-abandonment, Many most unnecessary inferences have been drawn from this. John adds an interesting feature, revealing the sensitive eye-witness of the scene, "and the house <span class="accented">was filled with the odor of the ointment</span>;" and the whole house of God ever since has been fragrant with her immortal and prophetic act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
