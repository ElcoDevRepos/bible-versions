The imagery of the bride and bridegroom is often used in Scripture to depict the relationship between God and His people. In the Old Testament, Israel is frequently referred to as God's bride (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>). In the New Testament, the Church is described as the bride of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). This phrase emphasizes the rightful and exclusive relationship between the bride (the Church) and the bridegroom (Christ), highlighting themes of love, commitment, and covenant.<p><b>The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him,</b><br>The "friend of the bridegroom" refers to a role similar to that of a best man in modern weddings. In Jewish wedding customs, this friend had significant responsibilities, including arranging the wedding and ensuring everything was in place for the bridegroom. This role is analogous to John the Baptist's role in preparing the way for Jesus (<a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a>). The friend&#8217;s duty was to support and facilitate the union, not to seek attention for himself, reflecting John&#8217;s humility and understanding of his mission.<p><b>and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom&#8217;s voice.</b><br>Hearing the bridegroom's voice signifies the arrival and presence of the bridegroom, marking the fulfillment of the friend&#8217;s duties. This joy is profound, as it indicates the successful completion of the preparations and the beginning of the celebration. John the Baptist expresses this joy upon recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling his role as the forerunner. This joy is echoed in the joy of believers who recognize and respond to Christ&#8217;s presence and calling (<a href="/luke/1-44.htm">Luke 1:44</a>, <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-34</a>).<p><b>That joy is mine, and it is now complete.</b><br>John the Baptist acknowledges his joy in seeing Jesus begin His ministry, affirming that his mission is fulfilled. This completion of joy reflects the satisfaction and fulfillment found in serving God&#8217;s purpose. It also points to the eschatological joy believers will experience in the consummation of Christ&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>). John&#8217;s statement underscores the theme of decreasing oneself to elevate Christ (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>), a principle of humility and servitude central to Christian discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, John the Baptist, is a pivotal figure in the New Testament who prepares the way for Jesus Christ. He uses the metaphor of a wedding to describe his relationship to Jesus and his role in God's plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (the Bridegroom)</a></b><br>Jesus is symbolically referred to as the bridegroom, indicating His central role in the relationship with His followers, who are often depicted as the bride.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Represents the collective body of believers, the Church, who are in a covenant relationship with Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_friend_of_the_bridegroom.htm">The Friend of the Bridegroom</a></b><br>This refers to John the Baptist himself, who sees his role as secondary to that of Jesus, akin to a best man who facilitates the wedding but is not the focus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_metaphor.htm">The Wedding Metaphor</a></b><br>This event or imagery is used to illustrate the joy and fulfillment found in the coming of Christ and the establishment of His relationship with the Church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_role.htm">Understanding Our Role</a></b><br>Just as John the Baptist understood his role as the friend of the bridegroom, we must recognize our roles in God's plan, focusing on pointing others to Christ rather than seeking personal glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joy_in_christ's_presence.htm">Joy in Christ's Presence</a></b><br>True joy is found in hearing and recognizing the voice of Christ, much like the friend of the bridegroom rejoices at the bridegroom's voice.

Hearing it signals that the long-promised Messianic age has dawned (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3-5</a> fulfilled).<p>- True servants rejoice when Christ is heard above every other voice, even their own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That joy is mine, and it is now complete</b><p>- John&#8217;s personal testimony: his joy is not piecemeal but &#8220;complete&#8221;&#8212;nothing more is needed once Christ is exalted (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>; <a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>).<p>- He has moved from prophetic anticipation (<a href="/luke/1-14.htm">Luke 1:14-17</a>) to fulfilled celebration.<p>- This teaches believers that fullness of joy rests in seeing Jesus receive His bride and praise, not in enlarging our platform or reputation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a> paints a wedding scene to clarify roles. Jesus is the Bridegroom who alone possesses the bride; John is the joyful friend who prepares the way, listens, and then steps back. Hearing Christ&#8217;s voice brings John overflowing, complete joy because God&#8217;s redemptive plan is unfolding exactly as foretold. Our calling mirrors his: prepare hearts, point to Jesus, and rejoice when all attention shifts to the Bridegroom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom.</span>--This is the only instance in this Gospel where the familiar imagery of an Eastern marriage meets us. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>, where we have the same imagery in the answer of our Lord to these same disciples of John, then taking sides with the Pharisees, on the question of fasting.) The "friend of the bridegroom"--called by the Hebrews "Sh?shb?n," and by the Greeks "Paranymph"--was charged with the preliminaries of the marriage. He arranged the contract, acted for the bridegroom during the betrothal, and arranged for, and presided at, the festivities of the wedding-day itself. It was a position of honour, in proportion to the position of the bridegroom himself, and was given to his chief friend. That friend then joyed in his joy, and there was none brighter on that day than he. This in John's thought is an illustration of his own position. The bridegroom is the Messiah; the bride is the Kingdom of God--the church, consisting of all who with pure hearts are willing to receive Him; the friend who has arranged the betrothal, who has prepared these hearts, is John himself. He now stands and hears the Bridegroom. Some of those who had been prepared by him for the Bridegroom would have come, it may be, and told him of his words. He is now near at hand. Throngs crowd to Him. The bride is approaching. Do they see in all this matter for envy? It is to him the consummation of all hopes. The life-work has not been in vain. The cup runs over. The joy is fulfilled.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - And now the Baptist bethinks him of another remarkable image, with which, as a student of the Old Testament, and being himself "more than a prophet," He was familiar. The tenderness of the imagery had not hitherto, however, comported with the ministry of the <span class="accented">vox clamantis.</span> Whereas the New Testament represents the loving kindness and righteousness of the Lord God under the metaphor of a <span class="accented">Father's</span> love to his prodigal but repenting children, the prophets were often disposed to set forth the same idea in the light of a <span class="accented">Husband</span> yearning over his bride, even betrothing her a second time unto himself after her faithlessness and folly. Jehovah and Jehovah's King and Representative are set forth as the Bridegroom of the true Israel (<a href="/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; the <a href="/songs/1.htm">Song of Solomon 1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>, etc.); and the New Testament writers, especially John himself, who delights in the image (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 9</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-17.htm">Revelation 22:17</a>), and Paul, who compares the relation of the Saviour to his Church under this endearing imagery (<a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), vindicate the legitimacy of the metaphor. The Baptist might easily think of this language, but it is more than possible that he had been profoundly touched by the news that had reached him concerning the presence of Jesus at a marriage feast. John had been a Nazarite from his birth. Jesus was revealing himself amid the pleasures and innocent joys of life and love. John's conception of the kingdom had been that of severance from the world - seclusion, ascetic restraint. Jesus had manifested his glory amid the festival and in the common life and daily ways of men. John may have seen that there was much in this to captivate the heart of the true Israel; and he glances at the bridal of heaven and earth in this new conception of the mission of the Messiah. It may have staggered him, as he had taught Israel to hope for One whose hand would be more heavy upon them and on their sins than his had been. Where was the axe laid at the root of the trees? where the fire that scorches to cleanse and purify? But he accepted to some extent the new revelation, and found his own place in the novel reconstruction of the kingdom. So he says, <span class="cmt_word">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom.</span> However, John throws in a novel thought, explanatory of his own position, and not found in the Old Testament imagery: "I am not the Bridegroom," says he; "but it is also true that I am not the Bride. Such is my position that I am standing outside the company of those who are the prophetic 'Bride.'" <span class="cmt_word">The friend</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the bridegroom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, answering to the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> of the Aramaic writers) is he who acts the part of intermediary - the confidant of both. He presides at the ceremonies of the betrothal and at the wedding tent, and especially in the interests of the bridegroom. The image was probably suggested to him by the great discovery made by the friend of the Cana bridegroom touching the "glory" of the mysterious Guest on that typical occasion. "The friend of the bridegroom" differs profoundly from the Bridegroom. The Christ will prove ready to occupy this position, and John has declared that he is not the Christ. Moreover, John differs from the Bride; he does not receive the lavish love, nor the deep intimacies of that affection, nor the dowry of sacrificial devotion with which that love will at length be won. This <span class="accented">paranymphios <span class="cmt_word"></span>standeth and heareth him.</span> It is not said, "seeth him." Some have argued that John here calls attention to the fact that all that the Bridegroom has been saying has reached him by means of the information brought to him on the part of those who were both his own disciples and the disciples of Jesus; but the next clause is inconsistent with this. The friend of the bridegroom stands ready to do the will and promote the honour and pleasure of his friend. (The materialistic and sensualistic manner in which some have pressed the force of the imagery is out of place.) "The voice of the bridegroom," the hilarious joy of the bridegroom, is a proverbial expression (<a href="/jeremiah/7-34.htm">Jeremiah 7:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-9.htm">Jeremiah 16:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>). There is a contrast felt between the formal business-like fellowship that prevailed between the bride and the friend of the bridegroom, and the free outspoken love of the bridegroom himself. The lispings of prophecy are contrasted with the outspoken utterances of the gospel of love. <span class="cmt_word">And he rejoiceth with joy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; cf. for this form of expression, which corresponds with the frequent Hebrew juxtaposition of the finite verb with the infinitive absolute, the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/30-19.htm">Isaiah 30:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-10.htm">Isaiah 66:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>, etc.; <a href="/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>; <a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17</a>; <a href="/acts/5-28.htm">Acts 5:28</a>; <a href="/acts/23-14.htm">Acts 23:14</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>). It is not an indubitable Hebraism, because similar expressions are found in the classics, as Plato, 'Sympos.,' 195, B., <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>; 'Phaedr.,' 265, D.; Soph., 'OEd. Rex,' 65; see Winer, 'Gramm. E.T.,' p. 585. This is the only place where such a construction occurs in the writings of John) <span class="cmt_word">because of the bridegroom's voice.</span> Intense joy is thus ascribed to one who was the minister of the bliss of another. <span class="cmt_word">This my joy</span> - or, <span class="accented">this joy, therefore, which is mine</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>hath been made full.</span> "I have thus completed my task, and reached the climax of my bliss. I have wooed and won," The bridal of heaven and earth is begun. In subsequent words of Jesus and his disciples other great epochs of complete consummation are referred to. The joy of the Lord will only be entirely realized when, after the resurrection and the second advent, the rapture of fellowship with his Bride will be completed. But the Baptist recognized that his own work was finished when the Messiah had been introduced to those who understood something of his claims, when the kingdom was at hand, when there were many who sought and found their Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
