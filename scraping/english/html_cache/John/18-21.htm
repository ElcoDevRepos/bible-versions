This rhetorical question highlights the injustice of the trial, as Jewish law required witnesses to establish guilt, not self-incrimination. Jesus points out the irregularity of the proceedings, emphasizing the lack of legitimate evidence against Him. This moment underscores the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the Messiah is described as being oppressed and afflicted, yet not opening His mouth in defense.<p><b>Ask those who heard My message.</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to the public nature of His ministry. Throughout His time on earth, He taught openly in synagogues and the temple courts, as seen in <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>. This transparency contrasts with the secretive and deceitful actions of His accusers. The call to ask witnesses aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires the testimony of two or three witnesses to establish a matter. Jesus' teachings were consistent and well-known, reinforcing His innocence.<p><b>Surely they know what I said.&#8221;</b><br>This statement emphasizes the clarity and consistency of Jesus' teachings. Those who heard Him, including His disciples and the crowds, could attest to His message. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus' words and actions were in line with the expectations of the Messiah as foretold in the Old Testament. Additionally, it highlights the accountability of those who heard Him, as they were now witnesses to His truth. This moment foreshadows the role of the apostles as bearers of Jesus' message after His resurrection, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being questioned by the high priest after His arrest.

Christ thus rebukes the craftiness and hypocritical endeavor of his enemies to induce him to inculpate his disciples, or to give his prosecutors matter against him. To false witnesses he preserved an invincible silence, and before Caiaphas and Pilate he answered to many of their queries not a single word, insomuch that these governors marveled greatly. However, the case was altered when Caiaphas, in full Sanhedrin, officially challenged him to say whether he was the Christ, and adjured him to declare whether he was the Son of God. Then, on the most public scale, knowing well the issues of his declaration, and of his oath-bound word, he did not hesitate to confess that he was the Son of God, and would come in the glory of his Father, and that he was no less than the Christ of God. On the present occasion, when Annas was seeking to justify his own craft, and to utilize the disgraceful betrayal which he had diplomatically and cruelly contrived, Jesus refused to incriminate either himself or his disciples. Renan has the temerity to say that this great announcement was quite superfluous, and probably was never made. Any conclusion whatever may be derived from historical documents, if such liberties may be taken with impunity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
