It reflects the Jewish leaders' curiosity and concern about John's identity and authority. In the context of first-century Judea, many were anticipating the arrival of the Messiah or a significant prophetic figure due to the Roman occupation and the prophecies in the Hebrew Scriptures. The question underscores the expectation of a deliverer or a significant religious figure.<p><b>Are you Elijah?</b><br>The inquiry about Elijah is rooted in the prophecy from <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>, which foretells the return of Elijah before the "great and dreadful day of the LORD." Elijah was a prominent prophet in Israel's history, known for his miraculous deeds and his ascension to heaven in a whirlwind (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>). The Jewish people expected Elijah to return as a precursor to the Messiah, which is why they questioned John the Baptist about this identity.<p><b>He said, "I am not."</b><br>John the Baptist's denial of being Elijah is significant. While Jesus later identifies John as fulfilling the role of Elijah in a spiritual sense (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>), John himself does not claim this title. This response highlights John's humility and his understanding of his role as a forerunner to Christ, rather than the literal return of Elijah.<p><b>Are you the Prophet?</b><br>This question refers to the expectation of a prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of God raising up a prophet from among the Israelites. In the first-century Jewish context, this figure was often associated with the coming Messiah or a significant eschatological figure. The question reflects the diverse expectations of the Jewish people regarding the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<p><b>He answered, "No."</b><br>John's response is a clear denial of being "the Prophet" like Moses. This further emphasizes his role as a preparer of the way for Jesus, rather than being the central figure himself. John's consistent denials of these significant titles point to his mission of pointing others to Christ, the true fulfillment of the prophecies and expectations of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A key figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist was a prophet who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

The very repudiation of Messiahship in this form seems to imply some association with the Messianic period of which they had so many conflicting ideas. Malachi (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) had predicted the coming again from heaven of Elijah the prophet, and the LXX., by translating the passage "Elijah the Tishbite," had strengthened the common mistake of a metempsychosis, or such an abnormal manifestation before the coming of Messiah. Schottgen ('De Messia,' H.H., vol. 2, pp 226, 490, 533-537) quotes a variety of proofs of this anticipation, and that Elijah was expected "<span class="accented">three</span> days before Messiah; that he would come in the mountains of Israel, weeping over the people, saying, 'O land of Israel, how long will you remain arid and desolate!'" (cf. my 'John the Baptist,' 3. &sect; 4). There was a true sense in which (as our Lord informed his disciples) John was the fulfilment of Malachi's prediction and of the language of the angel to Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12</a>), and that John came veritably in the spirit and power of Elijah. In that sense "Elijah had come already," just as Christ their <span class="accented">David</span> had come, in fulfilment of Ezekiel's vision (<a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; cf. <a href="/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), to rule over them. In the physical, superstitious sense, John the son of Zacharias was not the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah, and so he boldly answered the inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou Elijah?</span> with a categorical negative: I am not. They press their question once more. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the Prophet?</span> It is doubtful whether they here take up another popular expectation of the physical return of one of the old prophets, or whether, with an exegesis afterwards modified by the apostles, they point to <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and reveal the fact that they had not identified the prediction of "the prophet like unto Moses" with their Messiah. If they <span class="accented">had</span> identified these representations, they would not, of course, have pressed him with an identical question. It is highly probable that <span class="accented">that</span> prophecy had, with the predictions of Malachi and Isaiah, led to numerous expectations more or less identified with the Messianic cycle of coming events. In <a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>, we see the prevalence of the expectation - of a longing for an old prophet. They yearned for no upstart, but for one of the mighty brotherhood of departed men, in veritable flesh and blood. Now John and now Jesus was crudely suspected by some to be such a resuscitation.
