The man had been physically blind but now sees both physically and spiritually. This statement by Jesus emphasizes the revelation of His identity to those who are open to seeing it. In the broader biblical context, seeing is often associated with understanding and belief (e.g., <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). Theologically, this moment reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing sight to the blind (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>).<p><b>Jesus answered.</b><br>This indicates a direct response from Jesus, highlighting His personal engagement and willingness to reveal Himself to those who seek truth. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often answers questions or responds to situations in ways that reveal deeper spiritual truths (e.g., <a href="/john/4-26.htm">John 4:26</a>, <a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). His answers often challenge the listener to move beyond physical realities to spiritual understanding.<p><b>He is the One speaking with you.</b><br>Here, Jesus explicitly identifies Himself as the Messiah to the man who was healed. This is a rare moment of direct self-revelation, similar to His conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well (<a href="/john/4-26.htm">John 4:26</a>). The phrase underscores the personal nature of Jesus' ministry and His desire for individuals to recognize Him as the Savior. It also reflects the theme of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), who speaks truth and life into the world. This moment is a turning point for the man, leading to his confession of faith in Jesus as Lord (<a href="/john/9-38.htm">John 9:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of healing the blind man and reveals Himself as the Son of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was blind from birth and was healed by Jesus.

Now He reveals that the man has also been given the privilege of beholding the Messiah with his own eyes.<p>- The statement underscores the literal, visible presence of Christ: the one who opened the man&#8217;s eyes is the very One the prophets foretold (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="/luke/7-22.htm">Luke 7:22</a>).<p>- Seeing Jesus physically is meant to awaken spiritual sight, just as later Jesus says, &#8220;Whoever has seen Me has seen the Father&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>).<p>- This scene reminds us that God often grants tangible experiences to confirm spiritual truths (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26, 36</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus answered</b><p>- The man&#8217;s heart was searching: &#8220;Who is He, Sir, that I may believe in Him?&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-36.htm">John 9:36</a>). Jesus responds immediately, showing God&#8217;s readiness to meet genuine seekers (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p>- Throughout the Gospels, Jesus answers questions that matter for eternity, prioritizing revelation over curiosity (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> &#8211; 5; <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 26</a>).<p>- His answer is personal, direct, and authoritative, reinforcing that truth is found in a Person, not merely a concept (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is the One speaking with you</b><p>- Jesus plainly identifies Himself as the &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; introduced in the previous verse (<a href="/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35</a>). This title carries messianic weight from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, affirming both His humanity and divine authority.<p>- &#8220;The One speaking with you&#8221; highlights relationship: the Savior stands face-to-face, inviting faith through an ongoing conversation (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>).<p>- The man responds with worship (<a href="/john/9-38.htm">John 9:38</a>), illustrating that true sight leads to adoration (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>- Jesus&#8217; self-disclosure confronts every listener with a choice: believe and worship, or reject and remain in spiritual blindness (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>; <a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a> shows Jesus graciously revealing His identity to one newly granted sight. The healed man has already seen Him; now, through Jesus&#8217; answer, he understands whom he is seeing. Recognizing that &#8220;He is the One speaking&#8221; moves the man from curiosity to worship, demonstrating that genuine faith arises when physical sight is joined to spiritual revelation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span>--The answer reminds us of that to the woman of Samaria, "I that speak unto thee am He" (<a href="/john/4-26.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.">John 4:26</a>); but here both the sense of sight and that of hearing are appealed to as conveying knowledge to the mind. There is a special fitness in the emphasis thus laid upon the seeing Him, in the case of one whose very power to see was witness to the presence of the Messiah. The words do not refer to any earlier meeting, but the perfect tense refers to the completion of the act of vision and the abiding impression.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">[And</span><span class="cmt_word">] Jesus said, Thou hast both seen him</span>, with the eyes so recently opened.

Nowhere does our Lord more openly admit that he as the Christ, the Son of God. The disciples scarcely rise beyond the climax of this revelation even on the night of the Passion. The man's faith was waiting for its Object, and the vision comes to his unscaled spiritual vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You have already seen</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#974;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#333;rakas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
