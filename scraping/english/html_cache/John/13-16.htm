The repetition of "truly" underscores the certainty and authority of His words. In the Jewish tradition, "amen" is a declaration of affirmation, and its use here highlights the gravity of the teaching that follows.<p><b>no servant is greater than his master</b><br>This part of the verse reflects the hierarchical relationship between a servant and a master, a common social structure in the ancient world. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it serves as a reminder of the humility and service expected of His followers. The statement is a call to emulate Jesus' example of servanthood, as He had just demonstrated by washing the disciples' feet (<a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1-17</a>). This act of humility by Jesus, the Master, sets a precedent for His disciples.<p><b>nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him</b><br>The term "messenger" can be understood as an apostle or one who is sent with a message. In the cultural context of the time, a messenger was expected to faithfully represent the sender's intentions and authority. This phrase emphasizes the role of the disciples as representatives of Christ, who is the ultimate sender. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of submission to God's will, as seen in Jesus' own submission to the Father (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>).<p><b>Connections to Other Scripture</b><br>This teaching is echoed in other parts of the New Testament, such as <a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24-25</a>, where Jesus reiterates the principle that a disciple is not above his teacher. It also aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Paul describes Jesus' humility and obedience, even to the point of death on a cross. These passages collectively underscore the call to humility and service in the Christian life.<p><b>Types of Jesus Christ</b><br>Jesus Himself is the ultimate example of a servant leader. His life and ministry fulfill the prophetic imagery of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. By washing the disciples' feet and teaching this principle, Jesus embodies the servant role, foreshadowing His ultimate act of service on the cross. This typology reinforces the call for believers to follow in His footsteps, serving others selflessly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all future followers of Christ who are called to serve in humility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, where Jesus demonstrates servanthood by washing the disciples' feet, providing a powerful context for His words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies that true greatness in His kingdom is found in humble service.
