This event takes place shortly after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, a miracle that had a significant impact on the surrounding communities. The term "Jews" here often refers to the people living in Judea, particularly those in Jerusalem and its vicinity. The presence of a large crowd suggests that news of Jesus' miracles and teachings had spread widely, creating a sense of anticipation and curiosity. This moment occurs during the Passover festival, a time when many Jews would travel to Jerusalem, increasing the likelihood of large gatherings.<p><b>And they came not only because of Him,</b><br>The crowd's motivation for coming was not solely based on Jesus' reputation as a teacher and miracle worker. This indicates that Jesus' actions, particularly the raising of Lazarus, had sparked a deeper interest and intrigue among the people. The miracles served as signs pointing to Jesus' divine authority and messianic identity, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of miraculous healings as evidence of the Messiah's arrival.<p><b>but also to see Lazarus,</b><br>Lazarus had become a living testimony to Jesus' power over death, making him a figure of great interest. His resurrection from the dead was a unique and unprecedented event that drew attention not only to Jesus but also to Lazarus himself. This miracle was a foreshadowing of Jesus' own resurrection and served as a powerful demonstration of His claim in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>, where He declares Himself to be "the resurrection and the life."<p><b>whom He had raised from the dead.</b><br>The act of raising Lazarus from the dead is one of the most significant miracles recorded in the Gospels, highlighting Jesus' authority over life and death. This miracle is a direct challenge to the religious leaders who questioned Jesus' authority and sought to undermine His ministry. It also serves as a type of Christ's own resurrection, prefiguring the ultimate victory over death that Jesus would achieve. The raising of Lazarus fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's power and points to the eschatological hope of resurrection for all believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performed miracles and taught about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>A man from Bethany whom Jesus raised from the dead, serving as a testament to Jesus' divine power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people who were present in the region, many of whom were curious about Jesus and His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem where Lazarus lived and where Jesus performed the miracle of raising him from the dead.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_large_crowd.htm">The Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the growing interest and curiosity among the people regarding Jesus' miracles and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>The resurrection of Lazarus served as a powerful testimony that drew people to Jesus.

Their motives vary, yet every footstep toward that little village advances God&#8217;s purpose: to reveal Christ as Lord of life and death.
