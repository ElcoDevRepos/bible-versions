In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus has repeatedly demonstrated His knowledge of people's thoughts and circumstances (e.g., <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, <a href="/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17-19</a>). This acknowledgment by the disciples is significant as it shows their increasing faith and understanding of Jesus' divine nature. The concept of God knowing all things is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's omniscience is a key attribute (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>).<p><b>and that You have no need for anyone to question You.</b><br>Here, the disciples express their belief that Jesus' wisdom and authority are self-evident, requiring no external validation. This statement can be seen as a response to Jesus' earlier teachings and actions, which have consistently revealed His divine authority (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-30</a>). In the cultural context of the time, rabbis and teachers were often questioned to test their knowledge and authority. The disciples' statement indicates their recognition that Jesus transcends human teaching and understanding.<p><b>Because of this, we believe that You came from God.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration of faith is a pivotal moment for the disciples, affirming their belief in Jesus' divine origin. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus has made claims about His relationship with the Father (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36-37</a>, <a href="/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>). The disciples' confession aligns with the prologue of John, which states that Jesus is the Word made flesh, sent from God (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This belief is foundational to Christian doctrine, emphasizing Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, revealing His divine knowledge and origin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are expressing their growing understanding and belief in Jesus' divine nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Implicit in the disciples' declaration, acknowledging Jesus' divine origin and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_revelation.htm">The Event of Revelation</a></b><br>This moment is part of a larger discourse where Jesus is revealing deep spiritual truths to His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_omniscience.htm">Understanding Jesus' Omniscience</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus, being fully God, possesses complete knowledge.

He had answered their unutterable yearning. That which stirred them very deeply on many occasions was this proof that nothing in their hearts was hidden from him.

"Thou knowest all things." <span class="accented">The idea in their minds</span> does not embrace the full range of human inquiry, nor the depths of Deity, but all the things which are in their hearts to ask him.
