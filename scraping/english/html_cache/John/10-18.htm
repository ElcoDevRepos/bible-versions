In the context of Roman-occupied Judea, crucifixion was a common method of execution, often imposed by authorities. However, Jesus asserts that His life is not taken by force, highlighting His divine control over the situation. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant willingly submits to suffering.<p><b>but I lay it down of My own accord</b><br>Here, Jesus underscores His willingness to sacrifice Himself. This voluntary act is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6-8</a>, which speak of a willing servant. It also reflects the cultural understanding of a shepherd laying down his life for his sheep, a theme prevalent in <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>.<p><b>I have authority to lay it down</b><br>Jesus claims divine authority over His life and death, a significant assertion in a Jewish context where life and death were considered under God's control. This statement connects to <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-4</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word, through whom all things were made, affirming His divine nature and authority.<p><b>and authority to take it up again</b><br>This phrase points to the resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith. Jesus' authority to take up His life again is a testament to His divinity and power over death, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, where God raises Jesus, freeing Him from the agony of death. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not abandoning His Holy One to decay.<p><b>This charge I have received from My Father.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' mission is portrayed as divinely ordained, emphasizing His obedience to the Father. This reflects the relationship within the Trinity, where the Son submits to the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>.

The laying down of the life is absolutely self-determined, and therefore it is the reason of the Father's love. Up to the very last moments of life He lays stress on the perfectly voluntary nature of His death. "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit; and having said thus, He gave up the ghost." (See Note on <a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</span>--The words apply also to the human nature of our Lord, and the "power" spoken of is the authority derived from the Father. It is of His own will that He lays down His life and takes it again; but this, as the whole of the life of the Son, is in moral subordination to the Father. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19</a>; <a href="/john/19-10.htm" title="Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?">John 19:10</a>.) Hence it is that He speaks of taking His life again, while the general language of the New Testament speaks of His being raised by the Father. The taking again was under the Father's authority, and was therefore itself the Father's gift. (Comp. Note on <a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">This commandment have I received of my Father.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did I receive;</span> pointing, probably, to the commission at the time of the Incarnation. He has asserted in fullest terms the entirely voluntary nature of His one sacrifice. He repeats in fullest terms the voluntary subordination of Son to Father, which is based upon equality of nature. Not only was the authority by which He would die and rise again derived from the Father, but both these acts were included in the decree which gave to Him the Messianic work. We should be on our guard against the mistake which is often made of understanding this commandment of the laying down the life only; it clearly extends also to the taking it again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">No one taketh</span> <span class="cmt_word">it away from me, but I lay it down of myself.</span> Should the aorist be the true reading, then the whole of the Incarnation must have been regarded by the Lord as already accomplished, as a completed fact. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>, "no one" neither God, nor man, nor evil <span class="accented">spirit - taketh it</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my life, <span class="accented">away from me</span>, <span class="accented">from myself</span>, in the exercise of my sovereign will, in the full consciousness of spontaneity. I am <span class="accented">laying it down</span>, not in consequence of my impotence before the powers of darkness, but "from myself." This proceeding is in perfect harmony with the will of God the Father; but it is Christ's free act notwithstanding, and of all things the most worthy of the Father's love (cf. here <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, which appears at first to be in contradiction with the statement of this verse; but the closing words of the verse rectify the impression; see also <a href="/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>). Christ justifies his extraordinary claim to lay down and after his death (retaining then the full possession of his Personality), to reassume the life which for a while, in submission to the doom on human nature, he had resolved to sacrifice, he says, I have (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">right</span> - or, <span class="accented">power</span> and <span class="accented">authority</span> combined - <span class="cmt_word">to lay it down, and right to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.</span> I have power to do both these things. No other has ever put forth such a claim, and the discharge of it "from himself," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. spontaneously, is stated to be in consequence of an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, an appoint-merit, an ordinance, he had received from the Father. The Divine purpose was realized in his perfect freedom and his perfect and absolute fulfillment of the Father's will. The narrative of the agony in the garden, given by the synoptists, confirms the blending of his own freedom with the Divine order; but the language of this Gospel (<a href="/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a> (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>), and Matthew 19:11), and the best researches into what is called "the physical cause of the death of Christ" (see Dr. Stroud's valuable work on that subject), all confirm the voluntary nature of our Lord's suffering and death. "To cover this incomparable privilege with a veil of humility, he thought good to call it a command. The Father's mandate was, Thou shalt die or not die, thou shalt rise again or <span class="accented">not</span> rise again, according to the free promptings of thy love" (Godet). It was, however, the Father's appointment that Christ should freely exercise this stupendous consequence of his perfect obedience. So that all the assurances that God raised him from the dead are confirmed by the mode in which he speaks of his Divine right. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">No one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(oudeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3762.htm">Strong's 3762: </a> </span><span class="str2">No one, none, nothing. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">takes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7988;&#961;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(airei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_142.htm">Strong's 142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise, lift up, take away, remove. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">it</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Feminine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
