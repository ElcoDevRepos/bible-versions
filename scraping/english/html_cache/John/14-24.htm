In the biblical context, love is not merely an emotion but a commitment to obedience and faithfulness. The concept of love here aligns with the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. In the New Testament, love is a defining characteristic of a disciple (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p><b>does not keep My words.</b><br>Keeping Jesus' words implies obedience to His teachings and commandments. This reflects the Jewish understanding of the Torah, where adherence to God's law was a sign of devotion. In the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>), Jesus compares those who hear His words and act on them to a wise man who builds his house on the rock. The connection between love and obedience is a recurring theme in John's Gospel (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>The word that you hear is not My own,</b><br>Jesus emphasizes His unity with the Father, indicating that His teachings are not independent but are divinely sourced. This reflects the Jewish concept of a prophet who speaks not on his own authority but as a mouthpiece for God. In <a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>, Jesus states, "My teaching is not My own. It comes from Him who sent Me," reinforcing His role as the divine messenger.<p><b>but it is from the Father who sent Me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the mission and authority of Jesus as the sent one from God. The concept of being "sent" is significant in John's Gospel, highlighting Jesus' divine origin and purpose (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>, <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>). The Father-Son relationship is central to understanding the nature of Jesus' ministry and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of being anointed and sent by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, emphasizing the importance of love and obedience to His teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>- God the Father, who sent Jesus, is the source of the words Jesus speaks.
