It underscores the authority of Jesus' words, a common teaching method in Jewish tradition to highlight significant teachings.<p><b>the hour is coming and has now come</b><br>This indicates both a present and future reality. Theologically, it suggests the inauguration of a new era through Jesus' ministry, where spiritual resurrection is already occurring, and it anticipates the future physical resurrection. This dual aspect is a recurring theme in John's Gospel, emphasizing the "already but not yet" nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God</b><br>The "dead" here can be understood both spiritually and physically. Spiritually, it refers to those who are dead in sin, echoing <a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>, where Paul speaks of being "dead in trespasses and sins." Physically, it foreshadows the future resurrection of the dead at the end of the age. The "voice of the Son of God" signifies Jesus' divine authority and power, reminiscent of God's creative word in Genesis.<p><b>and those who hear will live</b><br>Hearing, in biblical terms, often implies obedience and acceptance. This phrase suggests that those who respond to Jesus' call will experience new life, both spiritually now and physically in the resurrection. It connects to the theme of eternal life found throughout John's Gospel, such as in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where belief in Jesus leads to everlasting life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is the Son of God, who possesses the authority to give life to the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Refers to those who are spiritually dead, as well as those who are physically dead, who will hear Jesus' voice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_god.htm">The Son of God</a></b><br>A title for Jesus, emphasizing His divine authority and relationship with God the Father.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hour.htm">The Hour</a></b><br>A significant time period in God's redemptive plan, indicating both a present and future reality.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hearing_and_living.htm">Hearing and Living</a></b><br>The act of hearing Jesus' voice leads to spiritual awakening and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_jesus.htm">The Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' declaration in this verse underscores His divine authority.

The reference here, as in the whole of this paragraph (<a href="/context/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21-27</a>), is to the spiritually dead. This is shown by the "now is," which cannot be applied to the physical resurrection (comp. <a href="/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>), and cannot be explained by the instances of physical restoration to life during the earthly ministry of our Lord; and also by the last clause, where "live" must mean the higher spiritual life, as it does in the whole context. It is shown too by the parallelism of the clauses with those of the previous verse:--<p>"He that heareth". . . . "the dead shall hear"<p>"My word". . . ."the voice of the Son of God,"<p>"Hath eternal life". . . . "they that hear shall live." The world is as a vast moral graveyard where men lie dead in sin,--sense-bound hand and foot, with spirits buried in bodies which should be holy temples, but have become as unclean tombs; but the voice of the Son of God speaks, and spirit, love, life, passes through the chambers of death, quickening souls whose death is as yet but a sleep, and those who hear and obey come forth into new life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - Once more the solemn asseveration, <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>, is repeated, when our Lord still further emphasized the authority of his own word, the Father's confirmation of its accuracy, and the Divine signature and testimony to its power. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is coming, and now is.</span> There will be more wonderful attestations to the truth than any which as yet have broken the silence of the grave. Not only will the physically dead rise from their bier or their grave in the fulness and strength of resume, life, but the spiritually dead in vast multitudes will pass from death into eternal life, will know that the bitterness of death is over, and that there shall be no more condemnation for them. The Holy Spirit was, when Jesus spake, about to convict the world of sin, and to unveil the glory of Christ to the eye of faith. Pentecost would confirm the word of Jesus, for the Spirit will bear witness to the reality of the risen Lord. But whereas that hour was only "coming," that marvellous day had yet to dawn upon the world, Jesus added it <span class="accented">now</span> <span class="accented">is</span> - while I am speaking the reality of this vast spiritual change is taking place. There are proofs enough already. "Now," already, at this very moment, <span class="cmt_word">the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God</span>. The spiritually dead shall be disturbed in their slumber and roused from their indifference, be made to know that the summons of supreme power and authority is addressed to them. Emphasis is laid upon the <span class="accented">Divine</span> force which is at work upon heart and conscience. "The Son of God," not "a son of man" merely, is uttering his voice. <span class="cmt_word">And they that have heard</span> - accepted the summons, "heard the word," and believed, not merely him that sent me (the teaching of ver. 24), but that he who has been sent is none other than the "Son of God" - these, said Christ, shall live. The form of the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> can only designate those who <span class="accented">give ear</span>, and by this the literal resurrection of all the dead is excluded. The teaching of this verse reasserts the teaching of ver. 24, and adds to it, and clothes the truth in the imagery of the general resurrection. The awful suggestion is involved that many of these dead ones will hear the voice of the Son of God, and not give heed to it. Hengstenberg endeavours to overthrow this general interpretation of the verse, making it equivalent to vers. 27, 28 rather than an expansion of ver. 24. The "now is," according to him, covers the whole period to the second advent, and the future <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> points to a future epoch in the <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. But the emphatic omission of the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the later and more explicit statement is against such a view, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is best explained by its adaptation to the whole clause. "The hour is coming" as well as "now is." The <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> "shall live," rather than shall be "made alive," is far more applicable to the resurrection of dead souls than of defunct bodies. It is equivalent to "have eternal life" of the previous verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
