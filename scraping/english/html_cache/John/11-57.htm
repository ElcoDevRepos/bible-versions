The chief priests were primarily Sadducees, who held significant power in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. The Pharisees, although differing in theological beliefs, often collaborated with the Sadducees to maintain religious and social order. Their orders reflect the growing tension and opposition to Jesus' ministry, as His teachings and miracles challenged their authority and interpretation of the Law.<p><b>that anyone who knew where He was must report it</b><br>This directive indicates the leaders' determination to locate Jesus, who had become a controversial figure due to His growing popularity and claims of divinity. The leaders were concerned about maintaining control and preventing any potential uprising that could attract Roman attention. This order also highlights the fear and urgency among the religious leaders to suppress Jesus' influence, as they saw Him as a threat to their power and the status quo.<p><b>so that they could arrest Him</b><br>The intent to arrest Jesus underscores the leaders' desire to eliminate what they perceived as a threat to their authority and religious traditions. This action foreshadows the eventual arrest and crucifixion of Jesus, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. The arrest was not merely a legal action but a pivotal moment in the divine plan for redemption, as Jesus' death and resurrection would provide salvation for humanity. This phrase also connects to the broader narrative of the Gospels, where Jesus' mission and the opposition He faced are central themes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who held significant authority in Jewish society.

Together they formed a powerful, though uneasy, alliance.<p>&#8226; Earlier, these same groups opposed Jesus for healing on the Sabbath (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>) and for claiming equality with God (<a href="/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unity here shows how threatened they felt by the raising of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-45.htm">John 11:45-48</a>). They feared that Rome might crush any messianic movement, costing them both influence and nationhood (cf. <a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar priest-Pharisee cooperation appears when they conspire during the final Passover week (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had given orders</b><p>The leaders moved from private plotting to public policy.<p>&#8226; They leveraged their recognized authority over the synagogue system (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Such official decrees reveal a hardening of unbelief&#8212;no longer investigating Jesus&#8217; claims but shutting them down (<a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42-43</a>).<p>&#8226; Their &#8220;orders&#8221; anticipate the legal proceedings that will climax at Caiaphas&#8217;s council (<a href="/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that anyone who knew where He was</b><p>The command spread beyond leadership circles to the ordinary populace.<p>&#8226; Passover pilgrims were pouring into Judea (<a href="/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>), so information could travel quickly.<p>&#8226; This mirrors earlier attempts to locate Jesus during feast times (<a href="/john/7-11.htm">John 7:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording underscores how elusive Jesus had become: He withdrew to Ephraim (<a href="/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>) until the appointed hour.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must report it</b><p>Silence would equal complicity; disclosure was mandatory.<p>&#8226; Such pressure placed everyday Israelites in a moral dilemma: obey human authority or honor the Messiah (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a> later echoes this tension).<p>&#8226; It echoes Saul&#8217;s pursuit of David when citizens were pressed for intelligence (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19-20</a>), highlighting the recurring pattern of hostile leadership hunting God&#8217;s anointed.<p>&#8226; The tactic intended to isolate Jesus from potential supporters (<a href="/john/12-11.htm">John 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that they could arrest Him</b><p>The ultimate goal was custody, not conversation.<p>&#8226; Earlier exploratory missions (<a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32, 44</a>-46) ended without arrest; now the intention is fixed.<p>&#8226; This fulfills prophetic expectation: &#8220;The rulers take counsel together against the LORD and His Anointed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse bridges Lazarus&#8217;s resurrection and the Passion narrative, showing how the miracle sealed their decision to eliminate Jesus (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>).<p>&#8226; Their plot advances until Judas supplies the needed information (<a href="/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2-3</a>), proving their resolve.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/11-57.htm">John 11:57</a> reveals a formal, public decree by Israel&#8217;s religious leaders to secure Jesus&#8217; arrest. Shocked by His undeniable power and fearing loss of control, they instruct the entire population to act as informants. The verse exposes hardened unbelief, heightens the tension as Passover approaches, and sets the stage for the cross. God&#8217;s sovereign timeline proceeds unhindered: human schemes will unwittingly fulfill the redemptive plan foretold in Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(57) <span class= "bld">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees.</span>--If the word rendered "both" is regarded as part of the text, it would connect this verse with the fact that the people sought for Jesus--"They on the one hand sought and asked questions about Him; but besides this, the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment . . ."

This would not have been a difficult task. Jesus and twelve men could hardly have been hidden from their spies. The country people must have been faithful to him, and the edicts were issued rather to intimidate the people than to secure the immediate end; but they were quite sufficient to excite the inquiries of Galilaeans and others who had gone to Jerusalem for the main purpose of seeing him. The interdict had been aimed probably at the family of Bethany, which was clearly one of some consequence, or against any household in Jerusalem which should harbor him. It may have been the occasion which stirred the devilish spirit in the mind of Judas. So long as Jesus was surrounded with an enthusiastic crowd, they dared not seize his person. They resolved on secrecy, but were bent on public humiliation. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
