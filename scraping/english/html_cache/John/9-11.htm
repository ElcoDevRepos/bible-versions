In the context of <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, the man born blind is responding to the Pharisees and others questioning him about how he received his sight. This reflects the broader theme of testimony and witness found throughout the Gospel of John, where individuals testify to the works and identity of Jesus.<p><b>The man they call Jesus</b><br>This phrase highlights the initial understanding of Jesus by the man who was healed. At this point, he knows Jesus only by name and reputation, not yet fully recognizing Him as the Messiah. This reflects the progressive revelation of Jesus' identity throughout the Gospel. The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of "Yeshua," meaning "The Lord saves," which is significant in understanding His mission.<p><b>made some mud and anointed my eyes</b><br>This action by Jesus is unique to this miracle and demonstrates His authority over creation. The use of mud, made from the earth, can be seen as a symbolic act reminiscent of God creating man from the dust of the ground in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>. The act of anointing is also significant, as anointing with oil or other substances was a common practice for healing and consecration in Jewish culture.<p><b>and He told me to go to Siloam and wash</b><br>The Pool of Siloam was a significant site in Jerusalem, used for ritual purification. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed its location and importance. The command to wash in Siloam can be seen as a test of faith and obedience, similar to Naaman's washing in the Jordan River in <a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>. The name "Siloam" means "Sent," which is symbolic of Jesus being the One sent by God.<p><b>So I went and washed and received my sight</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the man's obedience to Jesus' command, resulting in his healing. It illustrates the principle that faith and obedience to Jesus' words lead to spiritual enlightenment and transformation. The physical healing of the blind man serves as a metaphor for spiritual sight and understanding, a theme prevalent in John's Gospel. This miracle also fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened in the Messianic age.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus performs a miracle by healing a man born blind.

From mud made by the Creator&#8217;s hands to the obedient washing at Siloam, the account affirms that trusting and acting on Christ&#8217;s word turns darkness into sight&#8212;physically and spiritually&#8212;just as Scripture promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">A man that is called Jesus.</span>--Some of the better MSS. read, "<span class= "ital">The</span> Man that is called Jesus," implying that He would be known to the blind man and his friends.

The name is full of significance to him - the "Savior,': the "Healer;" but he knows nothing of his Messianic claims, nor of his Divine authority. He began, where all disciples must, with the <span class="accented">Man</span>. The manner of man soon wakes within him loftier questionings and a better explanation. At present the process seems magical, altogether inexplicable. Clay and Siloam water do not cure birth-blindness, he is in a maze, as well he might be. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> should be rendered, according to Meyer, "I looked up" (see <a href="/mark/16-4.htm">Mark 16:4</a>).

Doubtless it strictly means, "I received sight again;" but there is something in Grotius's explanation, "No one is incorrectly said to <span class="accented">receive</span> that which, though he be deprived of it, belongs to human nature as a whole" (see Westcott). The eyes were there, but unused.
