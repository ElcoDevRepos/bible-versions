In the context of the Gospel of John, the will of the Father is a recurring theme, highlighting the unity and harmony between Jesus and God the Father. This aligns with passages like <a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, where Jesus states that He seeks not His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him. The concept of God's will is central to understanding the divine plan for salvation, as seen throughout the New Testament.<p><b>that everyone who looks to the Son</b><br>The act of looking to the Son signifies faith and trust in Jesus Christ. This phrase echoes the imagery from <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>, where the Israelites were healed by looking at the bronze serpent lifted by Moses. Jesus Himself makes this connection in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>, indicating that just as the serpent was lifted up, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes may have eternal life. This typology underscores the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation.<p><b>and believes in Him</b><br>Belief in Jesus is a central tenet of Christian faith, as it is through faith that one is justified and receives salvation. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus as Savior and Lord. The Gospel of John frequently emphasizes belief, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>, where the purpose of the Gospel is stated to be that readers may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, they may have life in His name.<p><b>shall have eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is a key promise of the Gospel, representing not just unending existence but a quality of life in communion with God. This life begins at the moment of faith and continues beyond physical death. The concept of eternal life is contrasted with perishing, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, and is a gift from God through Jesus Christ, as affirmed in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise of salvation and restoration.<p><b>and I will raise him up at the last day.</b><br>The promise of resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian hope. Jesus assures believers of their future resurrection, which is a physical and bodily resurrection at the end of the age. This promise is reiterated in <a href="/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39, 44, and 54</a>, emphasizing the certainty and assurance of this future event. The "last day" refers to the eschatological culmination of history, when Christ will return, as described in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>.

The exercise of the mental power to see Him, the reception of Him and trust upon Him: this is man's acceptance of God's gift. The word rendered "seeth" means to look upon, to contemplate, and is the first step towards a true faith.<p>The analogy of the previous verse makes it probable that we should render the last clause of this verse, <span class= "ital">and that I should raise him up at the last day.</span> The difference of tenses is important. The believer has now the principle of eternal life, but this is to be his in its fulness when he shall be raised up at the last day. This thought of the final victory is the joyous refrain of these verses (<a href="/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>). The spirit brought into communion with the original source of life becomes life in itself. This life is greater than death, and cannot be holden by it (comp. <a href="/john/6-53.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.">John 6:53</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">is the will of</span> <span class="cmt_word">my Father</span> (or, <span class="accented">of him that sent me</span>), <span class="cmt_word">that every one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> of vers. 37, 39), treated separately and individually, who <span class="accented">beholdeth</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. steadily and continuously contemplates - <span class="cmt_word">the Son</span> (here he identifies himself with the revelation of the sonship in his own Person) <span class="cmt_word">and believeth on him</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. entrusts himself in a full moral surrender to <span class="cmt_word">the Son</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> must be here especially noticed) as thus revealed - <span class="cmt_word">should have eternal life</span>. This is the sublime law of Divine arrangement, and the fullest expression of the will of the Father (comp. <a href="/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>, "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life"). "<span class="accented">Behold and trust</span>." These are the conditions. The steady gaze, the full perception of the Divine Son-ship that is adequately expressed in the Son of man, issues by a Divine arrangement in life eternal. The blessedness of the life of faith, its elevation above the conditions of corruption and decay, are not all which he promises, for he added, <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (perhaps the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is carried on to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, and so the word is in subj. aor. rather than fut. indic., and, if so, the sentence may express the fact), <span class="cmt_word">that I should raise him</span> (not "it;" cf. ver. 39) <span class="cmt_word">at the last day.</span> It is not improbable, as we have seen, that our Lord uttered these verses (37-40) to the innermost circle of his followers. The first discourse closes with ver. 36. The disciples looked with eager and inquisitive glances at each other and at their Lord, and received these teachings of the Lord concerning the relation he was sustaining to the Father, and the claim he made to be the Almoner of the mercy and minister of the judgment of him that sent him. This great utterance corresponds with the celebrated synoptic recital (<a href="/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26, 27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
