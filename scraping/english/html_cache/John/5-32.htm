In Jewish law, the testimony of two or three witnesses was required to confirm a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Jesus refers to "another" who testifies about Him, which can be understood as God the Father. This aligns with the broader context of John's Gospel, where the Father&#8217;s testimony is seen through the works Jesus performs (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>) and the voice from heaven at Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The concept of divine testimony is crucial, as it underscores Jesus' divine authority and mission.<p><b>and I know that His testimony about Me is valid</b><br>Jesus expresses certainty in the validity of the Father's testimony. This assurance is rooted in the intimate relationship between the Father and the Son, a recurring theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). The term "valid" indicates that the testimony is trustworthy and authoritative, surpassing human testimony. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, where God declares His chosen servant. Jesus' confidence in the Father's testimony also serves as a model for believers, encouraging trust in divine revelation and the truth of the Gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who is speaking about the testimony concerning His identity and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>The "another" who testifies about Jesus, affirming His divine mission and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is a key figure in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, known for bearing witness to Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, who are questioning His authority and identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_testimony.htm">Divine Testimony</a></b><br>The testimony of God the Father is the ultimate validation of Jesus' identity and mission.

Just as the Law required more than one witness (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), the Son respects the Father-given standard. He points away from mere self-assertion and hints at a divine corroboration, anticipating the Father&#8217;s voice (<a href="/john/5-37.htm">John 5:37</a>) and later affirmations like the heavenly proclamation at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). By saying &#8220;another,&#8221; He signals:<p>&#8226; A second, independent voice beyond John the Baptist (<a href="/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; A higher witness than any human&#8212;ultimately, the Father Himself (<a href="/john/8-18.htm">John 8:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment of prophetic expectation that Messiah would be authenticated by God, not self-promotion (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who testifies about Me</b><p>The verb tense pictures ongoing testimony.

Therefore, His witness carries final authority.<p>&#8226; By calling the testimony &#8220;valid,&#8221; Jesus invites His audience to weigh evidence already present&#8212;Scripture, John the Baptist&#8217;s word, and His own signs (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Rejecting such a witness is not intellectual neutrality; it is willful unbelief (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18-19</a>).<p>Believers today rest in the same rock-solid validation: the Father has declared the Son, and that declaration stands forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-32.htm">John 5:32</a> shows Jesus appealing to the highest courtroom&#8212;His Father&#8217;s.

The reference to the Baptist is excluded by the words which follow. The difficulty which has been seen in this indirect reference to the Father is removed if we connect the words closely with those preceding them. The point is in the fact that another, different in personality from Himself, bore witness of Him.

In two of the oldest MSS., and some of the earliest versions, we read "ye know," and this has been adopted by some modern editors; but the origin of this reading is obvious, and there is no sufficient reason for departing from the common text. Its meaning is quite in harmony with the relation of the Son to the Father, which has been dwelt upon. The Father beareth witness, is bearing witness (comp. <a href="/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>), in the unity of work which Son and Father alike work (<a href="/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a>; <a href="/context/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19-20</a>; <a href="/john/5-30.htm" title="I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.">John 5:30</a>), and the Son knows that His power to do this work can come from no other source. His own nature responds to the Father's voice; He knows it to be true.

It is a mistake, with Ewald, De Wette, and many others, to suppose that this refers to the testimony of John the Baptist. By Augustine, Hengstenberg, Luthardt, Godet, Meyer, etc., it has been perceived that the "other" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) refers to the Father. Jesus expressly declines to receive John's testimony as his justification or sufficient vindication, and he contrasts it with the higher confirmation which in three distinct ways is already and continuously vouchsafed to him. The present tense, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, is in striking contrast to the testimony of John already silenced by imprisonment or death.
