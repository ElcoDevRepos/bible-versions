In biblical context, "flesh" often refers to human nature in its fallen state, prone to sin and mortality (<a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-8</a>). The concept of flesh being born of flesh underscores the idea that human beings, by their natural birth, inherit a sinful nature from Adam (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). This aligns with the doctrine of original sin, which suggests that all humans are born into a state of sinfulness. The phrase also reflects the limitations of human efforts and the inability of the flesh to achieve spiritual rebirth or salvation on its own (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>).<p><b>but spirit is born of the Spirit</b><br>This part of the verse introduces the necessity of spiritual rebirth, which is a central theme in Christian theology. The "spirit" here refers to the human spirit that is renewed and regenerated through the work of the Holy Spirit. This spiritual birth is essential for entering the Kingdom of God, as Jesus explains to Nicodemus in the broader context of <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a> (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-5</a>). The Holy Spirit's role in regeneration is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people. This transformation is not achieved by human effort but is a divine act of grace (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). The phrase also connects to the concept of being "born again," a term used to describe the profound change that occurs when one becomes a follower of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>). This spiritual rebirth is a type of resurrection, mirroring Jesus Christ's own resurrection and offering believers a new life in Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus, explaining the necessity of spiritual rebirth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council who comes to Jesus at night seeking understanding of His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this conversation takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The divine agent of spiritual rebirth, emphasized in Jesus' explanation of being "born of the Spirit."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_dual_nature.htm">Understanding the Dual Nature</a></b><br>Recognize that human beings have both a physical and a spiritual nature.

"Flesh," as distinct from "spirit," is human nature in so far as it is common with animal nature, consisting of the bodily frame and its animal life, feelings, and passions. "Flesh," as opposed to "spirit," is this nature as not under the guidance of the human spirit, which is itself the shrine of the Divine Spirit, and therefore it is sinful. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.">Galatians 5:16</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/galatians/6-8.htm" title="For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.">Galatians 6:8</a>.) It is this nature in its material constitution, and subject to sin, which is transmitted from father to son. The physical life itself is dependent upon birth. That which is born of the flesh is flesh.<p>There is an analogous law of spiritual generation. Spirit as opposed to flesh is the differentia of man as distinct from all other creatures. It is the image of God in him, the seat of the capacity for the communion with God, which is the true principle of life. In the natural man this is crushed and dormant; in the spiritual man it has been quickened by the influence of the Holy Ghost. This is a new life in him, and the spiritual life, like the physical, is dependent upon birth. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<p>(6) The sense suggested for the last clause, "In this manner is every one born who is of the Spirit," removes the necessity of finding something with which the work of the Spirit may be compared, and it is in this necessity that the received versions of the first clause really find their root.<p>These reasons are, it is thought, not an insufficient basis for the interpretation here adopted. It is adopted not without the knowledge that a consensus of authorities may be pleaded against it. For its details it may be that no authority can be pleaded, but the rendering of <span class= "greekheb">?????? </span>here by "spirit" is not without the support of width of learning and depth of power, critical acumen and spiritual insight, for it rests on the names of Origen and Augustine, of Albrecht Bengel and Frederick Maurice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been born of the flesh, is flesh.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> is not the physical as opposed to the spiritual or immaterial. nor is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> necessarily sinful, as we see from <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, but as it often appears in John's writing and Paul's, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> is the constituent element of humanity as <span class="accented">apart from grace</span> - humanity (body, intellect, heart, conscience, soul, spirit) viewed on its own side and merits and capacity, without the Divine life, or the Divine supernatural inbreathing. The being born of the flesh is the being born into this world, with all the privations and depravations, evil tendencies and passions of a fallen humanity. Birth into the theocracy, birth into national or ecclesiastical privilege, birth that has no higher quality than flesh, no better germ or graft upon it. simply produces flesh, humanity over again. When the Logos "became flesh," something more than and different from ordinary traduction of humanity took place. Destitute of any higher birth than the birth of flesh, man is fleshly, psychical, earthly, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14-25</a>), and, more than that, positively opposed to the will and grace of God, lashed with passions, defiled with debasing ideas, in enmity against God. Hence the birth "from the Spirit" is entirely antithetic to the birth from the flesh. <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been born of the Spirit, is spirit.</span> There is a birth which supervenes on the flesh-be-gotten man, and it is supernaturally wrought by the Spirit of God. As in the first instance, at man's creation, God breathed into man the breath of life, and by that operation man became a living soul; so now the new birth of man is wrought in him by the Spirit, and there is a new life, a new mode of being, a new bias and predomimating impulse. "A spiritual mind which is life and peace" has taken the place of the old carnal mind. He is "spiritual," no longer "psychical," or "carnal," but able to discern the things that are freely given to him. The eye of the spirit is opened, unsealed, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are revealed to him (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-5</a>). The reference to "birth of <span class="accented">water"</span> is not repeated, because the birth from water is relatively unimportant, and of no value apart from the Spirit-change of which it may be a picture, or even a synonym. More than that, the Spirit-birth, the Divine operation, is the efficient cause of that which, under the form of a human experience, is called <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. The human <span class="accented">metanoia</span>, rather than the new <span class="accented">birth</span>, is the great burden of our Lord's public address, as recorded in the synoptic Gospels. In both representations the same <span class="accented">fact</span>, the same condition and state of the human consciousness, is referred to. In "repentance," however, and in the moral characters which are the several preliminaries to the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount, a change is declared necessary for the constitution and inauguration of the kingdom of heaven. This change is there viewed from the standpoint of human experience, and urged in the form of a direct appeal to conscience. In this discourse to Nicodcmus the same change is exhibited on its Divine side, and as one produced by the Spirit of God. In the Sermon on the Mount "meekness," "poverty of spirit," "mourning," "hunger after righteousness," "purity of heart," the spirit of forgiveness and long suffering, are the moral conditions of those minds and hearts which would become the city of God and the light of the world (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-12</a>). On this occasion, when addressing the learned rabbi, Christ sums all up in the demand for a birth from the Spirit - a new and spiritual recommencement of life from the Spirit of God. The clause found in the Vetus Itala and the Syriac, <span class="accented">quia Deus spiritus est, et de Deo natus est</span>, is a gloss sustained by no Greek manuscript authority. Thorns here quotes two interesting passages from Philo, 1:533, 599, where the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is spoken of as given to man from above, and where the supremacy of the spiritual over the fleshly is made the only guarantee of admission into the world of spirit. But Philo obviously meant the intellectual rather than the moral element in human nature, and prized the ascetic process rather than the supernatural regeneration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Flesh</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#940;&#961;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(sarx)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4561.htm">Strong's 4561: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flesh, body, human nature, materiality; kindred. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
