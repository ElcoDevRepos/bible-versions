The first day of the week is Sunday, following the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday). This timing is crucial as it marks the beginning of a new creation, symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus and the new covenant. The early Christians began to gather on Sundays to commemorate the resurrection, which is why Sunday became the primary day of worship.<p><b>while it was still dark</b><br>The mention of darkness not only sets the scene but also carries symbolic meaning. Darkness often represents confusion, fear, or lack of understanding in biblical literature. The darkness here contrasts with the light of the resurrection, symbolizing the transition from despair to hope. It also highlights Mary Magdalene's devotion, as she approaches the tomb before dawn, eager to attend to Jesus.<p><b>Mary Magdalene went to the tomb</b><br>Mary Magdalene is a significant figure in the Gospels, known for her devotion to Jesus. She was one of the women who followed Jesus and supported His ministry. Her presence at the tomb underscores her loyalty and love for Jesus. In a cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued, her role as the first witness to the resurrection is profound and highlights the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance</b><br>The removal of the stone is a critical detail, indicating that something extraordinary has occurred. In the context of Jewish burial practices, tombs were sealed with large stones to protect the body from animals and grave robbers. The stone's removal signifies divine intervention, as it would have been too heavy for a single person to move. This act fulfills Jesus' prophecy about His resurrection and serves as a physical sign of His victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is the first to visit the tomb.

The complete glorification of Jesus in his resurrection. The record pauses for the awful day of that great sabbath, and resumes the marvelous recital when the greatest event in the history of the world is assumed and asserted to have taken place. Heathen and foes admit the fact of the death of Jesus; the evidence is overwhelming, multiform, sufficient to establish itself to the ordinary reason of mankind. It is a matter of indubitable history. The proof was given to all the world; but it is otherwise with the fact of the anastasis of Jesus. That stupendous event was revealed to the eye and mind of faith by a series of communications, which afford to different classes, groups, kinds, and states of mind specimens of the manner and quality of the resurrection-life. "Many infallible proofs" wrought (as St. Luke says, <a href="/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.) irresistible conviction as to the reality of the Resurrection. The Church of Christ was originated by a faith in this new and transcendental mode of existence. A generation of men passed, scores of communities were called into being throughout Palestine, Phoenicia, Syria, Lybia, Asia Minor, Achaia, Macedonia, Cyprus, Crete, and even in Italy and the capital of the Roman empire, all of them held together by the life-giving conviction of the reality of a world of spiritual body, into which the redeemed enter. Of this reality the resurrection-life of Christ was the type, the proof, the first fruit, and the earnest. This most astounding fact was preached in Galatia and Macedonia, in Corinth and Rome, in Babylon and Alexandria, before one word of the Gospels had been put on parchment. When the preaching of the apostles was reduced to written form, it was not with the idea of recording a fully detailed or easily harmonizable account of the Easter Day, or of providing rational, or juridical, or historic evidence of the method or order of the great events, but rather to provide five independent series of evidences to the revelations which the apostles and apostolic company received of the nature and quality of the new life for humanity which had now begun. Several details of profound interest occur in the synoptic narrative, concerning which John is silent - such e.g. as the rolling of a stone to the door of the sepulcher, the sealing of the stone by the Roman guard, the resurrection-appearances of the saints, the special preparation made by the women for further embalmment on the following days the great earthquake, the two companies of women that resorted to the sepulcher at successive intervals of time, and the different signs and even appearances by which their timorous hope was quickened into an adoring homage and world-compelling faith. Though John does not recite these well-known narratives, he presupposes some of them. Thus <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> although, unlike the synoptists, he says nothing of the stone that was rolled to the door of the sepulcher, yet (ver. 1) he refers to the fact that (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the stone was taken up or away. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although he says nothing of the two groups of women, yet he implies that Mary Magdalene was not alone at the sepulcher (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>): "We know not where they have laid him." With far greater particularity than St. Luke (<a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>), he describes Peter's visit to the sepulcher, and gives further details of facts which occurred at more than one interview between our Lord and his apostles, of which Luke and Mark had given a more shadowy outline (cf. here vers. 19-25 with <a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>, etc.; <a href="/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>). But we are not intending here to produce a history or harmony of these records, but to follow throughout the impressions produced by the Lord's self-manifestation upon the mind of the beloved disciple; not passing over the difficulties which his peculiar experiences have occasioned, when brought side by side with the synoptic and Pauline narratives. John first of all (vers. 1-10) describes how he came to believe personally in the resurrection of Jesus; then (vers. 11-18) the way in which the first manifestation was made to Mary of Magdala (vers. 19-23); how ten of the apostles, including himself, received a full and satisfying assurance of the stupendous fact (vers. 24-29); how once more, after an interval of eight days, not only Thomas, the most anxious, doubting, and incredulous of the eleven, but the entire group, came into full persuasion, not only of Christ's resurrection, but of his Divine nature and claims, his Messiahship and Sonship, and of their own personal possession of life in him and through him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The process of John's own personal conviction, by the discovery that the sepulcher was deserted. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now on the first day of the week</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, in the plural, is used for the whole of the week, sabbaton including in itself the various days that intervened between sabbath and sabbath, the first, second, third, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span> here and in <a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a> corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>. of <a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). All the evangelists agree about the day of the week, which thenceforward became the new beginning of weeks, "the Lord's day." <span class="cmt_word">Cometh Mary</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Magdalene</span>. Here all the evangelists are at one, although, judging from the synoptists, she must have been accompanied by other women. This is implied in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2, though Meyer repudiates such a hint by the remark that, in addressing the angels, she uses the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>; but this difference rather confirms, than otherwise, the significance of the plural, when she first breaks on the ear of the astonished disciples the wondrous news. But when she is confronted by the angels she is manifestly alone, and speaks for herself. It is probable that Mary Magdalene had preceded the other women, driven by the intensity of her adoring love and abounding grief, and hence some slight divergency appears as to the time at which she started on her pilgrimage. <span class="cmt_word">While it was yet dark</span>, early, in the depth of the dawn (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>); before the breaking of full day, and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;</span>, "exceeding early" of Mark, although, as he adds, after sunrise (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bb;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). This latter expression is difficult to reconcile as a statement of identical time. But many simple suppositions would explain the discrepancy. The Magdalene's home may have been at a greater distance from the sepulcher, down in the shadows of the eastern hills, while the home of the other Marys may have been readily accessible to the sepulcher. After the great earthquake described by Matthew (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>), and the supernatural darkness of the day but one before, there is no incompatibility in the twofold statement that it was yet dark (not night), although the sun had risen. A deep pall may yet be hanging over the world and place which had held in its bosom the body of the murdered Lord of glory. (She) cometh to the sepulcher, obviously with the purpose stated by all the synoptics. She was bringing the spices which she, with others, had bought on the Friday evening. They would not be behind Nicodemus and Joseph in the expression of their boundless love. The critics make merry over the superfluousness of these women purchasing fresh spices when they must have known the lavish expenditure of the two rich men upon the same design. But the combination of the two statements is absolutely true to nature; it is exactly what women would do all the world over, and an evidence of the authenticity of both narratives. <span class="cmt_word">And seeth the stone taken away out of the sepulcher.</span> This is all the information that St. John gives us, as antecedent to Mary's flight to Simon Peter and himself. We have to decide between three hypotheses: either  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Early</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#8146;</span> <span class="translit">(pr&#333;i)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4404.htm">Strong's 4404: </a> </span><span class="str2">Early in the morning, at dawn.
