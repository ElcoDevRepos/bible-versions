In the context of the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure. The act of asking the Father underscores the unity and distinct roles within the Trinity.

The pronoun is again emphatic--"I have given you your part to do. I on My part will pray the Father."

It is the word which John regularly uses when he speaks of our Lord as praying to the Father, and occurs again in <a href="/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:">John 16:26</a>; <a href="/john/17-9.htm" title="I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.">John 17:9</a>; <a href="/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a>; <a href="/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>.

"Another" implies that Christ had already stood in this position while present with them, helping with tender care their first efforts to stand or serve. John (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>) distinctly says, "We have now a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous," etc. And in this place (Ver. 17) the coming of the Paraclete was his own true return to his disciples. The following is the substance of Westcott's "additional note" on this word: "The two renderings of <span class="accented">Paraclete</span> as ' Comforter' in the Gospel, and 'Advocate' in the Epistle, are found in the English versions, with exception of Rhenish, from Wickliffe to Authorized Version and Revised Version. In the ancient versions, with the exception of Thebaic, the original word <span class="accented">Paracletus</span> is preserved. Its passive form by all analogous words will not justify here an active or transitive sense, but means 'one called to the side of another' with the secondary sense of helping, consoling, counseling, or aiding him. The classical use is 'advocate,' so used in Demosthenes, not found in LXX. Philo uses it in the same sense, and the rabbinic writers adopt the Greek word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span>, in opposition to 'accuser.' The apostolic Fathers use the word in this sense, but the patristic writers, Origen, Cyril, Gregory of Nyssa, Use it for ' Comforter.' In 1 John it. I no other word is satisfactory but 'Advocate,' and the suggestion is that the only meaning here that is adequate is that of one who pleads, convinces, convicts in a great controversy, who strengthens on the one hand, and defends on the other. Christ, as the Advocate, pleads the believer's cause with the Father against the accuser (<a href="/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>). The Holy Spirit, as the Advocate, pleads the cause of the believer against the world (<a href="/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>), and pleads Christ's cause with the believer (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14</a>)." Archdeacon Watkins has presented a large portion of the Talmudic evidence to the same effect. Thus from the 'Pirke Aboth,' 4:11, "He that keepeth one commandment obtains for himself one <span class="accented">paraklit</span>, but he who committeth one sin obtains for himself one <span class="accented">kattegor</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The word was incorporated into the Syrian language, as seen in the Peshito Syriac translation, both of the Gospel and the First Epistle of John. The Advocate who is to be <span class="accented">with</span> the disciples forever, arguing down opposition and silencing cavil, is <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of truth</span>. The abundant proof of this great function of the Holy Spirit is not wanting. There is Christ's promise (<a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19, 20</a>; <a href="/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>). Then in <a href="/acts/4-8.htm">Acts 4:8</a> and 13, whatever Christ had been to the twelve, that would the other Advocate, Mediator of Divine grace, be to the whole Church when the Lord's earthly manifestation should terminate. The genitive after "Spirit" sometimes denotes its great characteristic (cf. <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, "the Spirit of holiness;" <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, "Spirit of bondage" and "of adoption;" but in the same context we have "Spirit of God," "the Spirit;" <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>, "Spirit of wisdom and revelation; cf. also <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>, "Spirit of Christ;" <a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>, "the Spirit of glory"); and the idea is that this other Advocate, even the Spirit of truth, shall reveal truth to the disciples, convince them of truth, as Christ had done. <span class="cmt_word">Whom the world cannot receive.</span> There are antipathies between "the world" (as conceived by St. John) and "truth," which will render the world strangely unsusceptible of Divine teaching. Still, since the whole process of conviction is the distinct effect of the Holy Spirit <span class="accented">upon</span> the world (see <a href="/john/16.htm">John 16</a>.), the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> must not mean that the world cannot <span class="accented">accept</span> its convincing power, but cannot exert its power of convincing. Through apostles, who are his organs and representatives, the world will be convinced, and not apart from them. <span class="cmt_word">Because it seeth him not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="accented">- does</span> not behold him in his external revelations - <span class="cmt_word">and knoweth him not</span> by personal experience, "is not learning to know him" as these disciples even hitherto have been able to do in Christ. The world has proved by its rejection of Christ that it cannot behold the Divine energy in him, nor perceive by any inward experience his nature or the real nature of God; <span class="cmt_word">but ye, said Christ, are now learning to know him; for he abideth with you.</span> He has begun his abiding presence with you, <span class="cmt_word">and shall be in you</span>; and this state of things will continue to the end of time. "The future shows that the whole matter belongs to the domain of futurity" (Hengstenberg). The world cannot "receive," because it is dependent on visible things, and it cannot know because it cannot behold. You have no need to <span class="accented">behold</span>, and can and do <span class="accented">know</span> by another process. The passage is very difficult, because, if the world cannot <span class="accented">receive</span> the Spirit by reason of its own unspirituality and ignorance, how is the threefold conviction to be realized? May <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be regarded in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to seize hold of"? Rost and Palm give the following instances of this use of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in Homer: ' Od.,' 6:81; 8:116; ' II.,' 5:273; Herod., 4:130, etc. (cf. <a href="/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>). If so, the whole of this passage would read, "He will give you another Helper or Advocate, that he may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot <span class="accented">seize</span> (or take from you), because it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye are learning to know him, because he, according to the eternal laws of his being, dwelleth with you, and will be in you, and be altogether beyond the malice of the world." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#7936;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(Kag&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2504.htm">Strong's 2504: </a> </span><span class="str2">To also, I too, but I.
