This command to "leave her alone" highlights Jesus' defense of Mary's actions, emphasizing the importance of her devotion over material concerns. The cultural context of the time placed significant value on hospitality and honor, and Mary's act was a profound expression of both. Jesus' response also underscores His authority and the respect He commands among His followers.<p><b>"She has kept this perfume"</b><br>The perfume, identified as pure nard, was a costly and rare substance, often imported from India. Its use here signifies the depth of Mary's love and reverence for Jesus. The act of keeping or reserving such a valuable item for a specific purpose indicates foresight and intentionality. In the cultural context, anointing with oil or perfume was a sign of honor and consecration, often reserved for kings or significant religious figures.<p><b>"in preparation for the day of My burial."</b><br>This phrase foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial, which He had been predicting to His disciples. The act of anointing was traditionally associated with burial practices, where bodies were prepared with spices and perfumes to honor the deceased and mitigate the odor of decay. This prophetic action by Mary aligns with Old Testament practices and prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and death, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. It also serves as a type of Christ, prefiguring His sacrificial death and the anointing He would receive posthumously by the women at the tomb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, sister to Martha and Lazarus.

By commanding silence, the Lord asserts His authority (cf. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>) and corrects worldly thinking that reduces spiritual acts to mere economics.<p>&#8226; The rebuke also reminds the disciples&#8212;and us&#8212;that judging another&#8217;s offering can place us in opposition to Jesus Himself (<a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus replied</b><p>&#8226;

The verse teaches that heartfelt worship delights Christ, that planned sacrifice aligns with God&#8217;s purposes, and that every act of faith finds its true meaning in the death and resurrection of our Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span>--The majority of the better MSS. read, "that she keep this against the day of My burying." Comp. <a href="/matthew/26-12.htm" title="For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.">Matthew 26:12</a> and <a href="/mark/14-8.htm" title="She has done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.">Mark 14:8</a>. The thought here differs from that in the earlier Gospels, and the common reading has therefore been adapted to harmonise with it. Taking the better text, the meaning here is, "Let her alone, that she may keep this for the day of My embalmment." She had taken a pound of ointment (<a href="/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>) and had anointed His feet. This reminds Him of the embalmment of the dead, which had been but lately in that very place, and in the person of one sitting with them, present to their minds. Her act is significant of the future which is approaching. Let them not stay that deed of love. Before the week ends His body will be carried to the sepulchre. The preparations for the grave have already been begun.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The two readings of the text must here be compared with one another and with the synoptic narrative. The T.R. reads, <span class="cmt_word">Let her alone:</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the day of the preparation for my burial she has carefully guarded this</span> <span class="accented">precious perfume</span>. This is, in one sense, that very day, and she has found out the solemn fact in a way in which the disciples had as yet failed to do. With this agrees the language of the synoptists," Why trouble ye the woman? she hath wrought a good work on me;... she hath done that which was possible to her (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>)" of <a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>. In fact, Mark expressly conveys this thought - "she has anticipated the anointing of my body for the burial." If we have the direct testimony of Mark (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Peter), Christ must have expressed himself thus. Matthew also in different words records the same pathetic and subtle thought: "For in that she poured [cast] this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial" (John 26:12) Hengstenberg, Godet, and Stier abide by the reading of the T.R.; but the principal manuscripts, in most powerful combination, have led Lachmann, Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort to read here, <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "In order that she may keep or guard this for the day of my burial." Westcott says that the synoptists imply rather, by the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, that She had not already consumed the whole of the ointment. Meyer, with this text, translates, "Let her alone, that she may preserve it (this ointment, of which she has just poured some over my feet) for the day of my embalmment." This certainly seems inconsistent with the complaint of the disciples or of Judas, at the apparently superfluous expenditure, and would compel us to restrict the <span class="accented">abed to</span> the unused portion. The advocates of the T.R. reading say that it represents the original text, which has been altered by criticism arising from misunderstanding of the idea of the day of burial having ideally arrived; but why did they not alter on the same principle the language of the synoptists? The advocates of Lachmann's text say that it has been altered by copyists, to bring it into accord with the text of the synoptists. Lange justifies the Revised Version, "Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying," and puts it thus: "Permit her to keep it [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to have kept the ointment which she might have used at the burial of Lazarus] for the day of my burial," now ideally present in the outbreak of Judas's devilish malignity. So virtually Luthardt and Baumgarten-Crusius. Godet argues that this is forced and ungrammatical. But there is this advantage in it, that it brings the language into much closer relation with the synoptists. Westcott prefers the idea of Meyer. The older view is to me far mere satisfactory. Edersheim (2:35) adds to this, "Mary may have had that alabaster box from early days, before she had learned to serve Christ. When she understood that <span class="accented">decease</span> of which he constantly spake, she may have put it aside, "kept it," "against the day of his burying."
