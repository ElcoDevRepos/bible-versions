This phrase highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time. The Pharisees were the religious elite, known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. They viewed Jesus as a threat to their authority and influence. The use of the word "deceived" suggests that they believed Jesus was misleading the people, a common accusation against prophets who challenged the status quo. This echoes the skepticism seen in other parts of the Gospels, where religious leaders question Jesus' authority and teachings (e.g., <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>, <a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>).<p><b>replied the Pharisees.</b><br>The Pharisees were a prominent Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, known for their emphasis on purity laws and oral traditions. Their reply indicates a defensive posture, as they were concerned about maintaining their control over religious interpretation and practice. Historically, the Pharisees were influential in the synagogues and among the common people, which made their opposition to Jesus significant. Their response here is part of a broader narrative of conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities, which ultimately leads to His crucifixion. This interaction is a precursor to the growing hostility that Jesus faces, as seen in later chapters of John and the Synoptic Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in ancient Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses and traditions.
