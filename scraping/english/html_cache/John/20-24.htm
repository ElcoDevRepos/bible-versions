His dual name suggests a cultural connection between the Jewish and Hellenistic worlds, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of Jesus' followers.

Verse 19 records: &#8220;When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week&#8230; Jesus came and stood among them&#8221;. So, right after the risen Lord&#8217;s first appearance to the gathered disciples, John turns our attention to something crucial that took place simultaneously but out of sight: one member of the inner circle was absent. The word &#8220;now&#8221; reminds us that the gospel narrative is real history unfolding in real time (cf. <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thomas</b><p>Thomas shows up three times earlier in John&#8217;s Gospel, giving us a window into his personality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>&#8212;When Jesus heads back to Judea, Thomas bravely says, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with Him&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a>&#8212;He candidly voices confusion: &#8220;Lord, we do not know where You are going.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27&#8211;28</a>&#8212;He will soon move from skepticism to the loftiest confession, &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221;<p>Taken together, Thomas comes across as loyal, straightforward, and desirous of verifiable truth&#8212;qualities that many believers can identify with. His journey encourages honest seekers to bring doubts to the risen Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>called Didymus</b><p>John twice pairs Thomas&#8217;s primary name with an alternate one (see also <a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>). Mentioning both reinforces eyewitness accuracy. First-century readers who knew Thomas by either name could confirm these events, underlining Peter&#8217;s later assertion: &#8220;We did not follow cleverly devised myths&#8230; but we were eyewitnesses&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one of the Twelve</b><p>By stating Thomas&#8217;s place among &#8220;the Twelve,&#8221; John stresses:<p>&#8226; Jesus personally chose him (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; He shared apostolic authority (<a href="/matthew/10-2.htm">Matthew 10:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His testimony carries weight equal to the other apostles (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>Even faithful leaders can struggle with doubt; yet the Lord does not discard them. Instead, He equips them so the church may be &#8220;built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was not with the disciples</b><p>Thomas&#8217;s absence had immediate consequences:<p>&#8226; He missed the joy and assurance the others received when Jesus said, &#8220;Peace be with you&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; He lacked firsthand proof of the Resurrection, which fueled his later skepticism.<p>&#8226; He illustrates the warning, &#8220;Let us not neglect meeting together&#8230; so that we may encourage one another&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p>Reasons for his absence are hidden, but the lesson is plain: isolation often breeds uncertainty, while fellowship fosters faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when Jesus came</b><p>Jesus&#8217; post-resurrection appearances are bodily and historical, not mystical. He &#8220;showed them His hands and His side&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-20.htm">John 20:20</a>). The same Lord will graciously return eight days later, this time with Thomas present, proving that Jesus pursues individual disciples who struggle (<a href="/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26&#8211;27</a>). His willingness to come again underscores His patience and shepherd-heart (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24</a> highlights a missing disciple on resurrection evening. The verse reminds us: timing matters (&#8220;Now&#8221;), honest doubt need not disqualify (&#8220;Thomas&#8221;), Scripture is eyewitness truth (&#8220;called Didymus&#8221;), every believer has a calling (&#8220;one of the Twelve&#8221;), fellowship is vital (&#8220;was not with the disciples&#8221;), and Jesus meets us where we are (&#8220;when Jesus came&#8221;). Together these truths reassure believers that the risen Christ patiently draws even hesitant hearts into unshakeable faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus . . .</span>--Comp.

It is peculiar to John's narrative, and throws light upon the very construction of the Gospel. It reveals the characteristics of honest doubt, and indicates the abundance of the evidence which was offered to specific classes and conditions of mind to help them believe that the Lord had risen. The confession drawn from the heart of this apostle is not only valuable in itself, but it reflects a new luster on the previous manifestation. Moreover, it is cumulative in its argumentative force. The most skeptical is the most enthusiastic of the twelve. <span class="cmt_word">But Thomas, one of the twelve</span> (a term of designation for the first group of the apostles, and one which was not renounced, although two of them were absent. The number "twelve" had a symbolic and historic value from its relation to the twelve tribes, and we find (<a href="/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>.) that the eleven were anxious to fill up the vacant place left by Judas), <span class="cmt_word">called Didymus</span> (Greek for "twin," repeated here from <a href="/john/11-16.htm">John 11:16</a>, not simply to imply that Thomas was best known by his Greek name, but that there was a blending in him of intense love and a fear which had torment, a great ambition and yet exposure to moods of despondency, a desire to treat the whole manifestation of Christ as complete, to believe that the words of the Lord were all sublimely true, - coupled with a ghastly doubt that all was a delusion, a faculty of constructive faith and speculation, of transcendental intuition side by side with an intense desire for sensible manifestation, a greater belief in the Master than in the disciples, but no unwillingness to accept that which was sufficiently established). <span class="cmt_word">Thomas was not with them when Jesus came.</span> We can never know why he was absent. He was given to moody fear, and shrank into solitude; and doubtless in many ways and words, as well as those recorded, had implied the wreck of his hopes. Separated from the fellowship of kindred spirits, he augmented his gloom; he was fast tending to unbelief. The state of his mind throughout the Passover week may have been one reason why the apostles delayed their return to Galilee. They may have come frequently to him with their sublime announcement, not once nor twice only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Thomas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#969;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Th&#333;mas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2381.htm">Strong's 2381: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thomas, also called Didymus, one of the Twelve.
