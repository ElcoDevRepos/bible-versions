The context is the Upper Room Discourse, where Jesus prepares His followers for His impending departure. The request not to remove them from the world highlights the mission of the disciples to be witnesses and spread the Gospel. This echoes the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and underscores the importance of believers living in the world to fulfill God's purposes. Theologically, it reflects the concept of being in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>), emphasizing the call to engage with the world while maintaining spiritual distinctiveness.<p><b>but that You keep them from the evil one</b><br>Here, Jesus petitions for divine protection against Satan, referred to as "the evil one." This aligns with the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches His followers to pray for deliverance from evil (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). The phrase underscores the reality of spiritual warfare, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where Paul describes the struggle against spiritual forces. The request for protection implies that while believers are not removed from worldly challenges, they are safeguarded by God's power. This protection is not just physical but also spiritual, ensuring that their faith remains intact amidst trials and temptations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prayer, Jesus is interceding for His disciples before His crucifixion.

But there is for them a work in the world (<a href="/john/17-18.htm" title="As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.">John 17:18</a>; <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). He has finished the work His Father gave Him to do; He has glorified the Father on the earth (<a href="/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a>). There is a work for them to glorify Him (<a href="/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>), and He prays not that they should be taken out of the world before their work is done. The Christian ideal is not freedom from work, but strength to do it; not freedom from temptation, but power to overcome it; not freedom from suffering, but joy in an abiding sense of the Father's love; not absence from the world, but grace to make the world better for our presence; not holy lives driven from the world, and living apart from it, but holy lives spent in the world and leavening it.<p><span class= "bld">But that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>. The usage of St. John is, beyond question, in favour of the masculine. The only other passages where he uses the word in the singular are <a href="/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.">1John 2:13-14</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.

We have to bear in mind also that the present passage occurs in the second "Lord's Prayer," and that His prayer for them may with probability be interpreted in the same sense as the words in which He taught them to pray. On the whole, therefore, it seems likely, but yet is by no means certain, that we ought to read here, "that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The prayer of Jesus based on this. <span class="cmt_word">I pray</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;</span>; see Ver. 9; the <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> here defines the contents of the prayer) <span class="cmt_word">not that thou shouldest take them away</span> - lift them up and out - <span class="cmt_word">out of the world</span>, as thou art taking me by death.
