The Holy Spirit is introduced as a divine helper, emphasizing His role in guiding and supporting believers. This aligns with the Old Testament understanding of God's Spirit as a source of wisdom and strength (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>). The Holy Spirit's presence fulfills Jesus' promise to not leave His followers as orphans (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18</a>).<p><b>whom the Father will send in My name</b><br>This phrase highlights the Trinitarian relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Father sending the Spirit in Jesus' name signifies the authority and mission of the Spirit to continue the work of Christ. It reflects the unity and distinct roles within the Godhead. The sending of the Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<p><b>will teach you all things</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role as a teacher is crucial for the early disciples and the church. He provides understanding and insight into the truths of God, which is essential for the growth and maturity of believers. This teaching ministry is seen in the Spirit's inspiration of Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) and His guidance into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). The Spirit's teaching is not limited to intellectual knowledge but includes spiritual wisdom and discernment.<p><b>and will remind you of everything I have told you</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role in reminding the disciples of Jesus' teachings is vital for the preservation and transmission of the Gospel. This divine reminder ensures the accuracy and reliability of the apostolic witness, which forms the foundation of the New Testament. The Spirit's work in reminding is also personal, helping believers recall and apply Jesus' words in their daily lives. This promise is particularly significant in the context of the Last Supper, where Jesus prepares His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His departure and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_advocate.htm">The Advocate (Paraclete)</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who is promised to the disciples as a helper, teacher, and reminder of Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, who sends the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' promise, representing all believers who will receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is our Advocate, a term derived from the Greek "Parakletos," meaning one who comes alongside to help.
