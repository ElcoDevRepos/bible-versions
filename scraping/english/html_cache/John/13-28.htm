Despite being with Jesus for an extended period, the disciples often misunderstood His teachings and intentions. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels of the disciples' gradual comprehension of Jesus' mission. It also underscores the divine mystery of Jesus' plans, which were often hidden from human understanding until the appropriate time.<p><b>at the table</b><br>The setting is the Last Supper, a significant event in Christian tradition. This meal took place in an upper room in Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish religious life. The Last Supper is a pivotal moment, as it is the occasion where Jesus institutes the Lord's Supper or Communion, a sacrament observed by Christians to this day. The table setting also reflects the intimate fellowship Jesus shared with His disciples, akin to the communal meals common in Jewish culture.<p><b>knew why Jesus had said this to him</b><br>The "him" refers to Judas Iscariot, to whom Jesus had just spoken. The disciples did not understand the significance of Jesus' words to Judas, which were related to Judas' impending betrayal. This lack of understanding is consistent with the theme of spiritual blindness found throughout the Gospels. The disciples' inability to grasp the situation foreshadows the unfolding events of Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. This moment also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about betrayal by a close friend, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a trusted companion turning against the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is at the Last Supper with His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples, who is about to betray Jesus.

(See Introduction, p. 92, for an explanation of this passage, and the use that has been made of it to settle the question of the day of our Lord's death.) If the great feast of the Jews was to be held on the following day, and this was the 13-14th of Nisan, this advice would be perfectly comprehensible, whereas, if it was the 14-15th when Jesus and also all the Jews were celebrating the Passover, the purchase of any articles would have been contrary to law; and on both grounds the conclusion is drawn that this was the evening of the 13-14tb, and that the Paschal meal had certainly been anticipated by Jesus; but this is not absolutely conclusive, because, even though this were the Passover meal, it is certain that further sacrifices, called "Passovers," were consumed on the great day of unleavened bread that followed the Paschal meal, and it is not perfectly certain what was the custom of the Jews with reference to purchase. Talmudic authorities may be quoted both ways; and a large number of distinguished commentators ( Hengstenberg, Tholuck, Lange, M'Clellan) take the latter view, harmonizing John with the synoptists; but considering all the other difficulties that arise, Meyer, Godet, and Westcott take the former view. The supposition of a gift to the poor from the little stock is very suggestive of the almsgiving spirit that had pervaded all the habits of disciples taught by Christ (cf. <a href="/john/12-5.htm">John 12:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hengstenberg urges that the night of the Passover was that above all others on which the poor needed help to rejoice before the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(oudeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3762.htm">Strong's 3762: </a> </span><span class="str2">No one, none, nothing. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[at the table]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anakeimen&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_345.htm">Strong's 345: </a> </span><span class="str2">To recline, especially at a dinner-table.
