This phrase highlights their fear of losing control and authority. The miracles and teachings of Jesus were drawing large crowds, which threatened the established religious order. The leaders were worried that Jesus' popularity would undermine their power and influence over the people.<p><b>everyone will believe in Him</b><br>The leaders acknowledge the compelling nature of Jesus' works and words. This phrase indicates their awareness of the potential for widespread belief in Jesus as the Messiah. It reflects their fear that Jesus' message could lead to a mass movement that would challenge their authority. The leaders' concern was not just theological but also political, as they feared the implications of a large following.<p><b>and then the Romans will come</b><br>The Roman Empire had control over Judea, and the Jewish leaders were concerned about maintaining peace and order to avoid Roman intervention. This phrase reflects their fear that a messianic movement could be seen as a rebellion against Roman rule, prompting a military response. The leaders were trying to prevent any action that might provoke the Romans and lead to the loss of their limited autonomy.<p><b>and take away both our place</b><br>The "place" likely refers to the Temple, which was the center of Jewish religious life and a symbol of national identity. The leaders feared that Roman intervention could lead to the destruction of the Temple, as had happened in the past. The Temple was not only a religious center but also a source of power and prestige for the Jewish leaders, making its preservation crucial to them.<p><b>and our nation.</b><br>The leaders were concerned about the survival of the Jewish nation under Roman rule. They feared that any unrest could lead to severe repercussions, including the loss of their national identity and autonomy. This phrase underscores the political and nationalistic concerns of the leaders, who were trying to balance their religious authority with the practical realities of Roman occupation. Their fear was ultimately realized in 70 AD when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, fulfilling Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, composed of chief priests and Pharisees, who were concerned about Jesus' growing influence and the potential political repercussions from the Romans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, whose miracles and teachings were causing many to believe in Him, leading to the Sanhedrin's fear of losing control.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_romans.htm">The Romans</a></b><br>The occupying force in Judea, whose potential reaction to a mass following of Jesus was feared by the Jewish leaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of Jewish worship and governance, which the Sanhedrin feared would be threatened by Roman intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation_of_israel.htm">The Nation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective identity and religious community that the Jewish leaders were trying to protect from Roman disruption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_losing_control.htm">Fear of Losing Control</a></b><br>The Sanhedrin's fear of losing their position and power can serve as a warning against allowing fear to dictate our actions, especially when it comes to matters of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_priorities.htm">Misplaced Priorities</a></b><br>The leaders prioritized political stability over spiritual truth.

Ironically, their rejection of Christ invites the judgment they dread, while those who believe gain an unshakable kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(48) <span class= "bld">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him.</span>--He who but a short time since had escaped from their stones and violence, and had retired to Bethany, was now within two miles of Jerusalem. One work had carried conviction to the minds of all who had seen it, though many of them were of their own party. Another such miracle in the city itself would carry conviction, they think, to the minds of all.<p><span class= "bld">And the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</span>--The dread of the Roman power must have been constantly present to the Jews of that generation. They had seen Archelaus deposed, and a Roman procurator had come to carry into effect the enrolment decreed by Augustus (<a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>). Pontius Pilate had suppressed outbreaks by violence in the Temple itself. There had been tumults in connection with the Corban money and with Barabbas. The Temple mountain was the site of the Roman fortress Antonia, and this dread power may at any moment destroy the national life, which only existed on sufferance.<p>The attempts to prove that "our place" can mean "the Temple" must now be given up; and if we attach a local meaning to the word we must understand it of Jerusalem. It may, however, be questioned whether the word has any local signification here. Like our words "standing," and "place," and "position," it certainly may have a moral sense, and New Testament examples of this usage are frequent. (See <a href="/acts/1-25.htm" title="That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-17.htm" title="For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.">Hebrews 12:17</a>.) It is suggested that this sense is more in harmony with the feeling of the Pharisees. They possessed no local power; and the city could not be taken away from them more entirely than it already was. Their existence as rulers depended upon the Mosaic law and upon the services of the Temple. Round these centres they had gathered human tradition and ordinance, to which they clung because they only could interpret them, and they only could use the vast powers which were thus exercised over men. The Law had become practically an intricate system of tradition, and the Temple-service had become practically an intricate system of ritual. With this the Roman empire, following its usual policy, had not interfered, and the Jewish hierarchy had become the centre and the rulers of the national life. But in direct opposition to both of them had been the work and teaching of Christ. He had sought to establish for law and service the simplicity of their first spiritual principles. His spiritual teaching was a cutting to the very root of their whole being. If all the people believed on Him their <span class= "ital">raison d'etre</span> would be gone, and the Romans would no longer suffer an <span class= "ital">imperium in imperio,</span> which they now allowed because it swayed the masses of the people. They would take both their position, and with it the rank which they still claimed as a nation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If we let him alone thus,</span> as we have been doing hitherto - if we suffer him to do these things - <span class="cmt_word">all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away</span> from us, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from the Sanhedrin, from the lawful rulers in all matters affecting religious order or privilege, <span class="cmt_word">our place</span> - the city or temple - <span class="cmt_word">and the nation</span>, which we rule through our subordinates and surrogates, but to accomplish which we shall prove our incompetence if we cannot keep down all insubordination and hold perilous enthusiasm in check.
