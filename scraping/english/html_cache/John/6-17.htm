Boats were a common mode of transportation across the sea, which was a central hub for trade and travel in the region. This action sets the stage for the miraculous events that follow, highlighting the disciples' reliance on their own understanding before witnessing Jesus' divine intervention.<p><b>and started across the sea to Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often serving as a base for His activities. Situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, it was a bustling town with a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. The journey across the sea symbolizes a transition from one phase of ministry to another, as Jesus often used Capernaum as a launching point for His teachings and miracles. This movement also foreshadows the crossing from earthly understanding to spiritual insight.<p><b>It was already dark</b><br>The mention of darkness is not only a literal description of the time of day but also carries symbolic meaning. In biblical literature, darkness often represents uncertainty, fear, and the absence of divine presence. The disciples' journey in the dark can be seen as a metaphor for their spiritual journey, where they are about to encounter a deeper revelation of Jesus' identity. This setting prepares the reader for the miraculous event of Jesus walking on water, which dispels both physical and spiritual darkness.<p><b>and Jesus had not yet gone out to them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the disciples' initial separation from Jesus, highlighting their vulnerability and the challenges they face without His immediate presence. It underscores the theme of faith and trust, as the disciples must navigate the sea without Jesus physically with them. This moment of absence sets the stage for Jesus' miraculous appearance, reinforcing His divine authority and the assurance of His presence even when He is not visibly with them. This anticipates the promise of Jesus' continual presence with His followers, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were in the boat.
