It connects to earlier appearances in <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>, where Jesus shows Himself to His disciples, affirming His victory over death. The act of coming to the disciples signifies His initiative in seeking out His followers, a theme consistent with His earthly ministry.<p><b>and took the bread</b><br>Bread is a significant symbol throughout Scripture, often representing sustenance and life. In the context of Jesus' ministry, it recalls the feeding of the 5,000 (John 6) and His declaration as the "bread of life." This act of taking bread is reminiscent of the Last Supper, where Jesus broke bread with His disciples, symbolizing His body given for them.<p><b>and gave it to them</b><br>This action of giving reflects Jesus' role as a provider and sustainer. It also signifies fellowship and communion, echoing the breaking of bread in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>). The giving of bread by Jesus can be seen as a type of His provision for spiritual nourishment, paralleling the manna provided to the Israelites in the wilderness.<p><b>and He did the same with the fish</b><br>Fish, like bread, is a staple food in the region, and its mention here recalls the miraculous catch earlier in the chapter (<a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>). This act of sharing fish further emphasizes Jesus' role as a provider. The fish also connects to the feeding of the 5,000, where fish were multiplied alongside bread. This reinforces the theme of Jesus' miraculous provision and His authority over creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ, appearing to His disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.
