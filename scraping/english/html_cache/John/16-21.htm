Biblically, this pain is rooted in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, where God tells Eve that her pain in childbearing will be greatly increased as a consequence of the Fall. This serves as a reminder of the brokenness introduced into the world through sin. The imagery of childbirth is frequently used in Scripture to describe times of suffering that lead to new beginnings or deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/26-17.htm">Isaiah 26:17-18</a>, <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p><b>because her time has come;</b><br>The phrase "her time has come" indicates the inevitability and appointed nature of childbirth. In biblical terms, it can also symbolize the fulfillment of God's timing and purposes. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven, and this aligns with the idea that God has a sovereign plan for all events, including the trials and pains we endure.<p><b>but when she brings forth her child,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the transition from pain to joy. The act of bringing forth a child is a moment of fulfillment and culmination. In a broader biblical context, it can be seen as a metaphor for the coming of God's kingdom or the fulfillment of His promises, where initial suffering gives way to ultimate joy and redemption (<a href="/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-9</a>).<p><b>she forgets her anguish</b><br>The forgetting of anguish signifies the overwhelming joy that overshadows previous suffering. This reflects the biblical theme of redemption and restoration, where God turns mourning into joy (<a href="/psalms/30-11.htm">Psalm 30:11</a>, <a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>). It also points to the hope and assurance that believers have in Christ, that present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<p><b>because of her joy that a child has been born into the world.</b><br>The birth of a child brings immense joy and is a cause for celebration. In the biblical narrative, the birth of a child often signifies hope and the continuation of God's promises, as seen in the births of Isaac, Samuel, and ultimately Jesus Christ. The joy of new life is a powerful image of the new life believers have in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to bring salvation to the world (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing comfort and teaching to His disciples about the coming trials and the joy that will follow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being prepared for the sorrow of His crucifixion and the subsequent joy of His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/childbirth.htm">Childbirth</a></b><br>Used as a metaphor for the pain and subsequent joy that the disciples will experience, symbolizing the transition from sorrow to joy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering_and_joy.htm">Understanding Suffering and Joy</a></b><br>Just as childbirth involves pain followed by joy, Christians can expect that their current sufferings will lead to future joy.

The image is raw, real, and unavoidable&#8212;pain comes first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because her time has come</b><p>&#8211; Labor pain isn&#8217;t random; it arrives at a set moment. Jesus often spoke of &#8220;My hour&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>; 17:1). That hour&#8212;His suffering and death&#8212;was now at hand.<p>&#8211; Just as a mother cannot delay contractions once they begin, the events of the cross could not be postponed (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8211; For believers, trials likewise arrive under God&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12&#8211;13</a>). Knowing they are appointed helps us endure them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But when she brings forth her child</b><p>&#8211; The pain has a purpose: birth. Jesus points to the joy of new life on the other side of agony. His own resurrection would be that &#8220;birth&#8221; moment for the disciples (<a href="/john/20-20.htm">John 20:20</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/66-9.htm">Isaiah 66:9</a> asks, &#8220;Shall I bring to the point of birth and not give delivery?&#8221; God does not abandon His people in mid-labor.<p>&#8211; The empty tomb would prove that suffering was not the end but the means to glorious life (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She forgets her anguish</b><p>&#8211; The memory of pain fades in the light of the baby&#8217;s arrival. Likewise, the disciples&#8217; despair would melt when they saw the risen Christ (<a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture often pairs momentary sorrow with overwhelming future joy: &#8220;Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a> promises a day when God &#8220;will wipe away every tear,&#8221; echoing the mother who no longer dwells on her contractions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of her joy that a child has been born into the world</b><p>&#8211; The birth of one child floods a room with celebration; the resurrection floods the world with hope.<p>&#8211; Peter exults, &#8220;He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>).<p>&#8211; New life in Christ brings:<p>&#8226; forgiveness of sin (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>)<p>&#8226; power for holy living (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>)<p>&#8226; the promise of eternal glory (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>)<p>&#8211; Joy replaces anguish because God turns suffering into salvation, death into life, and despair into delight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a> uses the vivid picture of childbirth to assure Jesus&#8217; followers that their coming sorrow would be real but temporary, purposeful, and ultimately overwhelmed by joy.

Meyer and others rebel against any meaning beyond that of the following of joy upon sorrow; but Tholuck, De Wette, Ebrard, and Moulton see here the obvious reference to those "travail-pangs of death" with which St. Peter (<a href="/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>) said that the Holy One could not be restrained, agonies in which for a while every apostle must have wept and lamented, dying and being crucified with him, and to the glorious deliverance of all who suffered with him, when they live again in newness of life by the power of his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A woman</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(gyn&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
