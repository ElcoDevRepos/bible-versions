In the biblical context, keeping commandments is a sign of love and loyalty to God. The concept of obedience is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where the Israelites were given the Law through Moses. Jesus, in the New Testament, reiterates the importance of following God's commandments as a demonstration of faith and love. This obedience is not merely legalistic but is a response to the grace and love received from God.<p><b>you will remain in My love</b><br>Remaining in Jesus' love is conditional upon obedience to His commandments. This reflects the covenant relationship seen throughout the Bible, where blessings and favor are often contingent upon faithfulness and obedience. The idea of "remaining" or "abiding" suggests a continuous, ongoing relationship, akin to the vine and branches metaphor earlier in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. This abiding relationship is characterized by intimacy and mutual indwelling, which is central to the believer's spiritual life.<p><b>just as I have kept My Father&#8217;s commandments</b><br>Jesus sets Himself as the perfect example of obedience. His life and ministry were marked by complete submission to the Father's will, as seen in His prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). This obedience is not only a model for believers but also a fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, demonstrating His role as the Messiah. Jesus' obedience is a key theme in the Gospels, highlighting His role as the suffering servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>and remain in His love</b><br>Jesus' relationship with the Father is characterized by perfect love and unity, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, "I and the Father are one." This love is eternal and unbreakable, serving as the foundation for the love believers are invited to share in. Theologically, this reflects the Trinitarian relationship, where love is both the essence and the expression of the Godhead. Jesus' abiding in the Father's love assures believers of the security and depth of the love they are invited to experience through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, teaching them about the importance of obedience and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, whose commandments Jesus has perfectly kept, setting an example for believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings with His disciples before His crucifixion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandments.htm">The Commandments</a></b><br>Refers to the teachings and instructions given by Jesus, which are rooted in the love and will of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_as_an_expression_of_love.htm">Obedience as an Expression of Love</a></b><br>Keeping Jesus' commandments is a tangible way to demonstrate our love for Him.

This is a present, ongoing call, not a one-time act.

While we cherish love for Him, our hearts are abiding in that state which can receive His love for us.<p><span class= "bld">Even as I have kept my Father's commandments . . .</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/15-9.htm" title="As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.">John 15:9</a> and reference there. This is again an appeal to His perfect sinlessness, and willing subordination as Son to the Father. We should notice also that the keeping of the commandments is not an arbitrary condition imposed upon human love; but a necessary result of love itself, and therefore as true in the relation of the Son to the Father as it is in our relation to Him. Because the Son loved the Father, therefore He kept His commandments, and in this love He abode in the Father's love. Because we love God we necessarily keep His commandments, and in this love is the receptive power which constitutes abiding in the divine love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love</span>. This is the method and secret, the stimulus and proof, of abiding in the love of Christ. This is not exactly the converse (Westcott) of "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Doubtless there is a love which dictates obedience to the loved One's will. Our Lord here avers, however, something further, viz. that obedience issues in a <span class="accented">higher love</span>. The obedience here described is the outcome of love, but the power is thus gained to continue, dwell, in the Divine love, to abide, that is, in the full enjoyment and fullness of my Divine love to you. This is obvious from the confirmatory clause: <span class="cmt_word">Even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span> The Lord kept the Father's commandment always, doing those things which please him, offering up his precious life, laying it down that he might take it again; and the consequence is that he then and there knew that he was filled with all the fullness of the Divine love. The very impressive line of thought pervades this passage, that what the Father was to him, that he would prove to his disciples. What the love of God was to the Christ, the love of Christ was to his disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
