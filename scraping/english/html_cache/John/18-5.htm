Nazareth was a small, insignificant village, which fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The term "Jesus of Nazareth" was often used to emphasize His humble beginnings and to distinguish Him from others named Jesus. In the cultural context, Nazareth was not highly regarded (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>), which highlights the humility of Christ's incarnation. The identification by the soldiers and officials shows their intent to arrest the specific person known for His teachings and miracles.<p><b>Jesus said, &#8220;I am He.&#8221;</b><br>In this response, Jesus uses the phrase "I am," which echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, where God declares, "I AM WHO I AM." This connection underscores Jesus' divine identity and authority. The use of "I am" in this context is significant because it demonstrates Jesus' willingness to reveal Himself and His control over the situation, even as He is about to be arrested. This declaration also fulfills His earlier statements about His identity (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>) and His role as the Good Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them.</b><br>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, is identified as the betrayer, fulfilling the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend who would betray. His presence with the arresting party highlights the gravity of his betrayal, as he had been a trusted member of Jesus' inner circle. Judas' actions are a stark reminder of the human capacity for betrayal and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan through human choices. His standing with the soldiers and officials symbolizes his complete alignment with those opposing Jesus, contrasting with his previous role as a disciple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_of_nazareth.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, recognized as the Messiah and Son of God.

His presence here highlights the fulfillment of prophecy and the gravity of betrayal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arresting_party.htm">The Arresting Party</a></b><br>A group consisting of Roman soldiers, temple guards, and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees, sent to arrest Jesus. Their presence signifies the opposition Jesus faced from both religious and secular authorities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_gethsemane.htm">The Garden of Gethsemane</a></b><br>The location where Jesus was arrested.

Altogether, the verse shows Jesus willingly, knowingly, and sovereignly stepping into His redemptive mission, proving both His humanity and His deity while Scripture unfolds precisely as foretold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.</span>--He was known to many of them (<a href="/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="/john/7-46.htm" title="The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.">John 7:46</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-55.htm" title="In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?

Jesus saith unto them, I am</span> <span class="accented">he<span class="cmt_word"></span>.</span> Then, in all probability, the miscreant, the son of perdition, said," Hail, Master!" and kissed him; and there followed before and after his act the sublime replies given, "Companion, wherefore art thou come?" and "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" John, however, overwhelmed with the majesty and spontaneous self-devotion of the Lord, calls attention to the language he addressed to the "baud" which surrounded him. In some royal emphasis of tone he said, "I <span class="accented">am</span> (he)," and the same kind of effect followed as on various occasions had proved how powerless, without his permission, the machinations of his foes really were. In the temple courts, and on the precipice of Nazareth, the murderous Jews and Galilaeans were foiled (compare the murderers of Marius and of Coligny) by the moral grandeur of his bearing; and <span class="cmt_word">when he said, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>). Whether this was a supernatural event, or allied to the sublime force of moral greatness flashing in his eye or echoing in the tone of his voice, we cannot say, but associating it with other events in his history, the supernatural in his case becomes perfectly natural. It was so that he whose "I am he" had hushed the waves and cast out the devil, and before whose glance and word John and Paul fell to the earth, as if struck with lightning, did perhaps allow his very captors (prepared by Judas for some display of his might) to feel how powerless they were against him. It is remarkable that our narrative should place between the "I <span class="accented">am he"</span> and its effect, the tautologous remark if there be nothing to explain it, <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was Betraying him, was standing with them</span>. This implies that Judas had taken some step equivalent to that described in the synoptic narrative. There is some momentary consolation in the thought that the traitor fell to the ground with his gang, and for an instant saw the transcendent crime he had committed in betraying the innocent blood with the kiss of treachery and shame. Thoma sees in the approximation of Judas the approach of the prophetic Beast to the true King, and endeavors out of the letters of his name to read the number 666! It is true that <a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a> represents Satan as having entered into Judas. He stood there, he fell there, with the powers of darkness. What a moment: The devil may have tempted Christ to blast his emissaries with the breath of his nostrils; but, true to his sublime mission, he is occupied only with the safety and future work of those who knew that he had come out from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;soun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
