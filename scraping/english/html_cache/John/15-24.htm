The miracles of Jesus, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and feeding the multitudes, were unprecedented and fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). These works were meant to authenticate His message and reveal His divine nature (<a href="/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37-38</a>). The reference to "works that no one else did" underscores the unparalleled nature of Jesus' ministry, distinguishing Him from previous prophets and teachers.<p><b>they would not be guilty of sin</b><br>Here, Jesus speaks to the increased accountability that comes with witnessing His works. The presence of His miracles left the people without excuse for their unbelief. In biblical context, sin is often linked to the rejection of God's revelation (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). By witnessing Jesus' works and still rejecting Him, the people were guilty of a greater sin, as they were rejecting the clear evidence of God's presence and power among them.<p><b>but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity between Jesus and the Father, a central theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). The rejection of Jesus is equated with the rejection of God Himself, highlighting the severity of their unbelief. The hatred mentioned here reflects the deep spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that characterized many of the religious leaders and people of that time. This rejection fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah about the suffering servant who would be despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The phrase also underscores the tragic irony that those who were most familiar with the Scriptures and the promises of God failed to recognize and accept the fulfillment of those promises in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking about His miraculous works and the rejection He faces.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the audience to whom Jesus is speaking in this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Implicit in the context, they are the ones who have seen Jesus' works and yet rejected Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>Jesus refers to His relationship with the Father, emphasizing the unity and shared mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miraculous_works.htm">The Miraculous Works</a></b><br>The miracles Jesus performed, which were unprecedented and served as evidence of His divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_accountability_of_witnessing_miracles.htm">The Accountability of Witnessing Miracles</a></b><br>Witnessing the works of Jesus brings a responsibility to respond in faith.
