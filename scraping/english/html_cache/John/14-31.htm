This obedience is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who fulfills God's will. Jesus' obedience is also a model for believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where Paul describes Christ's humility and obedience even to death on a cross. This obedience underscores the unity and harmony within the Trinity, as Jesus acts in complete alignment with the Father's will.<p><b>so that the world may know that I love the Father</b><br>Here, Jesus reveals the purpose of His obedience: to demonstrate His love for the Father. This love is not merely emotional but is expressed through action and obedience, setting a standard for believers. The world, in this context, refers to humanity at large, including both Jews and Gentiles. This statement also connects to <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God's love for the world is demonstrated through the giving of His Son. Jesus' love for the Father is a reflection of the divine love that believers are called to emulate, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>.<p><b>Get up! Let us go on from here</b><br>This phrase marks a transition in the narrative, as Jesus prepares to leave the upper room with His disciples. It signifies a shift from teaching to action, as Jesus moves towards His impending arrest and crucifixion. The urgency in Jesus' command reflects the pressing nature of His mission. Geographically, this movement likely takes them towards the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of significant events leading to Jesus' arrest. This call to action can also be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, urging believers to move forward in faith and obedience, as echoed in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>, which encourages believers to run the race set before them with perseverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples, emphasizing His obedience to the Father and His love for Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>Referred to by Jesus as the one who commands Him, highlighting the divine relationship and authority structure within the Trinity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are being prepared for His impending departure and the events of His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents humanity and the broader audience that will witness Jesus' obedience and love for the Father through His actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus shares His final teachings and prepares His disciples for His departure.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Command</a></b><br>Jesus models perfect obedience to the Father.

We shall read then, "But, that the world may know that I love the Father, and that as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do, arise, let us go hence." He has asserted, in the previous verse, the sinlessness which makes His act wholly self-determined. He now expresses the subordination of His own to the Father's will, and summons the Apostles to rise up with Him from the table, and go forth from the room.<p><span class= "bld">But that the world . . .</span>--The words seem to point back to "the prince of this world" who has just been mentioned. The prince cometh, but it is to a defeat; and the very world over which he has ruled will see in the self-sacrifice of Jesus the love of the Father. That love will reclaim them from the bondage of the oppressor and restore them to the freedom of children.<p>It is an interesting question which we cannot hope with certainty to solve, whether or not in obedience to the command they went from the room at once. In other words, were the discourse of John 15, 16 and the prayer of John 17, uttered in the room after the summons to depart, or on the way to the garden of Gethsemane? The immediate connection of the opening words of the next chapter with the present verse naturally leads to the opinion that they were spoken in the same place, and, in the absence of any hint of a change, it is safe not to assume any. The words of <a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a> are probably those which express the act to which the words our Lord has just spoken summon them.

They leave the guest-chamber, and so the remainder of the discourse was delivered in the brightness of the Paschal moon, under shadow of the walls of Jerusalem, or in some corner of the temple area, or some convenient place on the way to Gethsemane.
