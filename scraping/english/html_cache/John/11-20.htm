Her eagerness to meet Jesus demonstrates her faith and hope in His power, even in the face of her brother Lazarus's death. This action can be seen as a reflection of the Jewish custom of going out to meet a respected teacher or rabbi. The anticipation of Jesus' arrival also highlights the close relationship between Jesus and the family of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, who lived in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem (<a href="/john/11.htm">John 11:1</a>).<p><b>she went out to meet Him</b><br>Martha's decision to go out to meet Jesus signifies her active faith and willingness to seek Him in times of distress. This act of going out can be seen as a metaphor for seeking divine intervention and comfort. It also reflects the cultural practice of showing hospitality and respect by meeting guests before they reach one's home. Martha's actions contrast with those of her sister Mary, indicating different ways of expressing faith and grief.<p><b>but Mary stayed at home</b><br>Mary's choice to remain at home may indicate a different expression of grief or a contemplative nature, as seen in her previous interactions with Jesus (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>). This contrast between Martha and Mary highlights the individuality in their responses to Jesus' presence and the situation at hand. It also sets the stage for Mary's later encounter with Jesus, where she expresses her sorrow and faith in a more emotional manner (<a href="/john/11-32.htm">John 11:32</a>). The cultural context of mourning, where family members would stay at home to receive comforters, may also explain Mary's initial decision to stay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>The sister of Mary and Lazarus, known for her active and service-oriented nature.

Whether we rush outward in active trust or remain still in quiet hope, Scripture assures us that Jesus is coming&#8212;and His arrival changes everything.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming . . .</span>--This is partly to be explained from the position in which they stood towards Him, and partly from the fact of the presence of the Jews at the house.

The clause describes precisely the position of the mourner, who sat on or near the ground, while those who came to lament with her sat around. (Comp. <a href="/context/job/2-13.htm" title="So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.">Job 2:13-13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> points back probably to ver. 1. The type of character so beautifully contrasted in the previous reference to the family at Bethany appears again, and confirms the historical character of <a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38</a>, etc., as well as of the narrative before us. Thoma says that this picture is "simply painted with synoptic color." Martha is the mistress of the house. <span class="cmt_word">Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</span> Martha was a woman of impulse, energy, practical duty; like Peter, she was ready even to give advice to her Lord, and eager to put everybody in his rightful place. On the first opportunity she hastened at once to "meet" Jesus, even without at first warning her sister of his approach. Mary, contemplative, pensive, undemonstrative under ordinary circumstances, but with a great fund of love, was sitting in the house receiving the condolences of the Jews (cf. ver. 19). Weiss suggests that Jesus was well aware, from the station of the family, and from the fact that hitherto his own friendship for the sisters had not submitted <span class="accented">them</span> to the ban, that "many Jews" would have congregated in the house of mourning. Consequently, Jesus does not come straight to the house, but allows it to be known that he is there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
