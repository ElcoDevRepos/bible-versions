It encompasses the lessons on love, servanthood, and the coming of the Holy Spirit. The context is the Upper Room Discourse, where Jesus prepares His disciples for His impending departure. This teaching is a continuation of His mission to reveal the Father and His kingdom. It connects to the broader narrative of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), emphasizing His role as the divine teacher.<p><b>while I am still with you.</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges His physical presence with the disciples, which is soon to change with His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This statement underscores the urgency and importance of His teachings, as His time on earth is limited. It also highlights the transition from Jesus' earthly ministry to the work of the Holy Spirit, who will continue to guide and teach the disciples after Jesus' departure. This transition is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the coming of a new covenant, where God's Spirit will dwell within His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, providing them with comfort and instruction before His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are His closest followers who have been with Him throughout His ministry.

Everything He taught is trustworthy and sufficient; He addressed them personally, and He timed His instruction so they would be equipped for life after His ascension. The verse calls believers today to cherish His words, trust their completeness, and rely on the Holy Spirit to keep those words alive and active in daily life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">while abiding with you.</span> He was about to depart from them.

This shows that, while the disciples are to approach the Father "in the Name," in the fullness of perfection involved in the filial Name of Jesus, so the Father sends the Paraelete in the same Name, in the full recognition of Christ as the Sphere of all his gracious work. Meyer emphasizes by it the <span class="accented">Name</span> of Jesus; "<span class="accented">in</span> my Name," say Grotius, Lucke; "at my intercession" or "in my stead" (Tholuck, Ewald); "as my Representative" (Watkins). But the great Name of Jesus is "<span class="accented">the</span> Son" (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-5</a>). In the Sonship which he realized and displayed, the Father himself was manifested. The Spirit is sent from the Father fully to reveal the Son, while the substance of the teaching and meaning of the life of our Lord, in his Divine training of souls revealed the Father. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a masculine and emphatic pronoun, which gives personal quality and dignity to the Spirit, and points to all that is here predicated of his agency) <span class="cmt_word">shall teach you all things</span> that you need to know over and above what I have said (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>), and he will assist you to know more than you do now. <span class="cmt_word">He shall remind you of the all things which I have said to you.</span> The teaching of Christ, according to St. John's own statement, was vastly more extensive than all that had been recorded, the impression produced far deeper than anything that could be measured; yet even this would have been evaporated into vague sentiment, if the veritable things, the marvelous and incomparable wisdom, uttered by the Lord had not, by the special teaching of the Spirit, been re-communicated to the apostles by extraordinary refreshment of memory. The supernatural energy of the memory of the apostles, and their profound insight, is the basis of the New Testament, and the fulfillment of this promise. This sacred training will not teach specifically new truths, because the germinant form of all spiritual truth had been communicated by Christ; nor would the instruction create a fundamental deposit of tradition as yet unrevealed; nor is it to be such an intensification or addition to things already said as to contradict the teaching of the Lord; but the Holy Spirit will bring to the remembrance of the apostles all that the living Logos had spoken. Hence the mystic, the traditionist, and the rationalist cannot find support for their theses in these great words. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, however, gives a bright hint of the completeness of the equipment of the apostles for their work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">All this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have spoken</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#949;&#955;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(lelal&#275;ka)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
