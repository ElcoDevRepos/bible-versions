It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' earlier words in <a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>, where He calls His followers to take up their cross daily. The act of carrying the cross signifies submission to God's will and the bearing of burdens. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, where the Suffering Servant bears the iniquities of others. This moment underscores Jesus' role as the sacrificial Lamb, willingly taking on the sins of the world.<p><b>He went out</b><br>This indicates Jesus leaving the city of Jerusalem, as executions were carried out outside the city walls to maintain ceremonial cleanliness (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). The act of going out also symbolizes Jesus being cast out of the community, bearing the reproach and shame of sin. It connects to the scapegoat ritual in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the sins of the people were symbolically placed on a goat that was sent out into the wilderness.<p><b>to The Place of the Skull</b><br>The Place of the Skull, or Golgotha, is traditionally identified as a hill outside Jerusalem's walls. The name may derive from the hill's shape or from its association with death and execution. This location is significant as it fulfills the typology of the Old Testament sacrifices, which were made outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12</a>). The site is a reminder of the cost of sin and the ultimate sacrifice Jesus made for humanity.<p><b>which in Hebrew is called Golgotha</b><br>The use of the Hebrew name Golgotha emphasizes the Jewish context of Jesus' crucifixion. It connects to the Aramaic-speaking Jewish population of the time and highlights the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy and law. The name itself, meaning "skull," may also symbolize the place of death and the victory over sin and death that Jesus' crucifixion would achieve. This moment is a pivotal point in salvation history, where the prophecies of the Old Testament converge in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this passage, Jesus is carrying His own cross to the place of crucifixion.

They did not receive him in the fullness of his grace, but they did receive him to inflict the curse and shame and death for which they had plotted and clamored. This powerful suggestion is brought out by the amended text. At this point, when the sacred Sufferer left the Praetorium and was dragged into the rush of the vociferating crowd, the synoptic narrative becomes far fuller in detail. The terrible tragedy in-eludes the disrobing. The bleeding form is once more clothed with his own garments (<a href="/matthew/27-31.htm">Matthew 27:31</a>; <a href="/mark/15-20.htm">Mark 15:20</a>). It is not necessary to suppose a second scourging (see ver. 1). The circumstance mentioned (<a href="/luke/23-26.htm">Luke 23:26</a> and parallel passages) of Simon of Cyrene made to bear his cross after him, shows how Jesus in his human nature had suffered already. A second scourging (if we judge by all we can gather of such an infliction) would have been followed by immediate death, and would thus have snatched from them the realization of their inhuman purpose. The statement that, <span class="cmt_word">bearing his cross for himself, he went forth</span>, shows that they tried to force him thus in his agony to endure this additional humiliation, and, from his physical exhaustion, were compelled to make use of the expedient described by the synoptists. Mark (<a href="/mark/15-22.htm">Mark 15:22</a>) introduces another most suggestive word, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "they carry him" from the place where they compelled (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) Simon to take up his cross, and at least he hints, if he does not express, the terrible fact that they had, by their fell cruelty of all kinds, at length exhausted all the human physical strength of the Sufferer. John's language, though at first sight discrepant with Luke's, really explains it. Luke also describes the wailing of the daughters of Jerusalem, and the sublime self-forgetfulness with which Jesus turned their thoughts from his agony to themselves and their children. Matthew and Mark both relate another scene, which seems as if one gleam of pity had crossed some heart - "They offered him wine, mixed with narcotic gall," to stupefy his senses, and lull his physical agony. He did not put it by "with suicidal hand;" but, as Keble sang - <p><span class="accented">"Thou wilt feel all, that thou mayst pity all;<br />And rather wouldst thou wrestle with strong pain<br />Than overcloud thy soul,<br />So clear in agony,<br />Or lose no glimpse of heaven before the time."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year.'</span>) <span class="cmt_word">He went forth to a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha</span>. "He went forth" from the Praetorium along the Via Dolorosa, wheresoever it was, beyond the city wall (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>, etc., "He suffered without the gate"). Moses had forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>) capital punishment within the camp (cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>; <a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). The traditional site of the place is far within the present walls in the north-western quarter of the city, not far from the gate of Damascus; and endless discussions have prevailed with respect to the line of the second city wall, which at that time must either have included or excluded the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The identification of the site of Golgotha is rendered difficult from the eagerness with which theories have been sustained. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ferguson's theory is that Constantine's" Church of the Resurrection" is to be found in the 'dome of the rock' in the temple enclosure! He urges that the tradition was moved thence to the "Church of the Holy Sepulcher" in the eleventh century, when Fatimite kaliphs drove the Christians away, and persecuted the pilgrims to such an extent as to produce the reaction of the Crusades.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Carrying</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#950;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(bastaz&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_941.htm">Strong's 941: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps remotely derived from the base of basis; to lift, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[His] own</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(heaut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Reflexive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1438.htm">Strong's 1438: </a> </span><span class="str2">Himself, herself, itself. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">cross,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#961;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(stauron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4716.htm">Strong's 4716: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cross. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He went out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
