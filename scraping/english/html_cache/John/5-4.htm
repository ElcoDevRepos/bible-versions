The pool was believed to have healing properties, and the descent of an angel indicates divine intervention. The concept of angels as messengers and agents of God's will is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, where angels ascend and descend on Jacob's ladder. The belief in angelic activity reflects the Jewish understanding of God's interaction with the world, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, where angels are described as protectors.<p><b>and stirred the water</b><br>The stirring of the water signifies a miraculous event, believed to be the moment when healing power was imparted to the pool. This aligns with the biblical theme of water as a symbol of cleansing and renewal, as seen in the story of Naaman in <a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10-14</a>, where washing in the Jordan River leads to healing. The stirring could also symbolize the movement of the Holy Spirit, reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God moves over the waters during creation.<p><b>As soon as the water was stirred</b><br>The immediacy of the healing opportunity emphasizes the urgency and faith required to receive God's blessings. This reflects the biblical principle of seizing the moment of divine favor, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, which encourages seeking the Lord while He may be found. The stirring of the water serves as a test of faith and readiness, similar to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where preparedness is crucial.<p><b>the first to enter the pool would be healed of his disease</b><br>This phrase highlights the competitive nature of the healing process, where only the first to enter the pool receives the miracle. It underscores the theme of perseverance and determination in seeking God's intervention, as seen in the story of the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>, who pushes through the crowd to touch Jesus' garment. The healing of diseases through divine means is a recurring theme in the Gospels, pointing to Jesus' ministry of healing and His role as the ultimate healer, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of healing through His wounds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pool_of_bethesda.htm">Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate, known for its healing properties.

Sick people flocked there &#8220;waiting for the moving of the water&#8221; (v. 3). This background frames verse 4 and shows why hope centered on that pool rather than any physician. Compare similar gatherings of the afflicted around Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34&#8211;36</a>) where divine intervention, not human skill, brought relief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An angel of the Lord went down</b><p>Verse 4 states, &#8220;For from time to time an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Angels are literal messengers who carry out God&#8217;s assignments (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a>; <a href="/acts/12-7.htm">Acts 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Here the angel&#8217;s descent underscores that healing is God-initiated, not a superstition. Just as the Angel of the Lord guided Israel through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>), so this angel brought guidance and mercy to Bethesda&#8217;s sufferers.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;from time to time&#8221; reminds us that God acts according to His timing (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a> speaks similarly about Christ&#8217;s coming &#8220;in the fullness of time&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The stirring of the water</b><p>The angel &#8220;stir[red] up the water.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physical movement provided a visible sign, much like Moses&#8217; raised staff before the Red Sea parted (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 21</a>). God often attaches a tangible element to reassure faith (<a href="/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The stirrings were not random; they were purposeful acts of God&#8217;s compassion, echoing His promise, &#8220;I am the LORD, who heals you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The first to enter was healed</b><p>&#8220;The first one to enter the pool after the water was stirred would be healed of whatever diseases he had.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This requirement pressed the sick toward alertness and expectancy, much like Israel had to step into the Jordan before it parted (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; It illustrated grace mingled with responsibility: God provided the miracle, yet individuals still had to respond (<a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51&#8211;52</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;whatever diseases&#8221; shows the completeness of God&#8217;s power, paralleling Jesus&#8217; blanket authority in <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> where He healed &#8220;every disease and sickness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Foreshadowing Christ the ultimate healer</b><p>By recording the angelic healings, Scripture prepares hearts to recognize a greater visitation: Jesus Himself.<p>&#8226; The pool&#8217;s limited mercy (one person at a time) contrasts with Christ&#8217;s unlimited reach (<a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>, &#8220;He laid His hands on each one&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The disabled man in <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5</a> had no one to help him in quickly (v. 7), highlighting human helplessness apart from Christ, who then heals him instantly (vv. 8&#8211;9).<p>&#8226; Thus verse 4 functions as a living parable: divine grace is available, yet the fullest, easiest access comes through Jesus alone (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for believers today</b><p>&#8226; God is still sovereign and can use angels, medicine, or miracles according to His will (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Prompt obedience matters; when God stirs the &#8220;waters&#8221; of opportunity, faith should move without delay (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Compassion for the physically and spiritually wounded should mirror Christ&#8217;s example, not leaving them &#8220;with no one to help&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-7.htm">John 5:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4</a> records a real, periodic miracle in which an angel stirred Bethesda&#8217;s pool so the first entrant was healed.
