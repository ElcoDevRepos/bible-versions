These disciples were selected from various backgrounds, including fishermen and a tax collector, and were called to leave their previous lives to follow Jesus. The term "disciple" indicates a learner or student, emphasizing their role in learning from Jesus' teachings and example. The twelve disciples are often seen as a representation of the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing a new covenant community.<p><b>the one whom Jesus loved</b><br>This phrase is traditionally understood to refer to John, the son of Zebedee, one of the twelve apostles. John is often identified as the "beloved disciple" in the Gospel of John, which is attributed to him. This designation highlights a special relationship between Jesus and John, suggesting a deep personal bond. The phrase underscores the theme of love that permeates John's writings, reflecting the intimate and transformative nature of Jesus' love for His followers. This special relationship is also seen in John being entrusted with the care of Jesus' mother, Mary, at the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>).<p><b>was reclining at His side</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, meals were often eaten in a reclining position, especially during formal occasions like the Passover meal. This practice involved lying on one's side on a couch or cushion, with the head toward the table and feet away from it. Reclining at the side of the host was a position of honor, indicating closeness and favor. This setting is significant as it takes place during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment before Jesus' crucifixion. The act of reclining at Jesus' side symbolizes the intimate fellowship and trust between Jesus and His disciples, particularly John. This scene foreshadows the deep spiritual communion that believers are invited to share with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is at the Last Supper with His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciple_whom_jesus_loved.htm">The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel, who is depicted as having a close relationship with Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The final meal Jesus shares with His disciples before His crucifixion, a significant event in Christian theology.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reclining_at_his_side.htm">Reclining at His Side</a></b><br>A cultural practice during meals in ancient times, indicating a position of closeness and intimacy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The location where the Last Supper takes place, a setting for many important teachings and events in the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_christ.htm">Intimacy with Christ</a></b><br>The beloved disciple's position at Jesus' side symbolizes the deep, personal relationship we are invited to have with Christ.
