John and Peter were the two disciples who ran to the tomb after Mary Magdalene reported that the stone had been rolled away. John's arrival at the tomb first is significant, as it demonstrates his eagerness and devotion. The fact that he reached the tomb first but did not enter immediately shows a level of respect and deference to Peter, who was the leader among the apostles. This moment highlights the close relationship between John and Jesus, as well as the dynamics within the early group of disciples.<p><b>also went in.</b><br>John's decision to enter the tomb after Peter signifies a moment of courage and faith. The act of entering the tomb is symbolic of entering into the mystery of the resurrection. In Jewish culture, entering a tomb would have been considered ritually unclean, yet John's willingness to do so underscores the importance of the event. This action marks a turning point from fear and confusion to understanding and belief. The empty tomb itself serves as a powerful testament to the resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.<p><b>And he saw and believed.</b><br>This phrase captures the moment of realization and faith for John. The Greek word for "saw" (&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#949;&#957;) implies more than just physical sight; it suggests understanding and perception. John's belief upon seeing the empty tomb is significant because it indicates a shift from doubt to faith without needing to see the risen Christ physically. This belief is rooted in the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecies about His resurrection, as well as Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay. John's belief sets an example for future generations of Christians who would come to faith through the testimony of the apostles and the Scriptures, rather than physical evidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_disciple.htm">The Other Disciple (John)</a></b><br>Often identified as John, the beloved disciple, who is known for his close relationship with Jesus.

The writer, whoever he was, emphasizes his own smaller courage, his tardy recognition of the fact; but he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And he saw, and believed.</span> According to Augustine, Erasmus, and Luther, he believed what Mary had said. He saw now that the tomb was empty, and believed her report, whether it went on to describe the first angelic message or not; but Lucke, Lange, Meyer, and Moulton, following Chrysostom, etc., rightly interpret "he believed" that Jesus had not been taken by others from the grave. He saw there were no signs of haste or confusion, or of a rifled tomb. He believed that he had risen, that this death of his had been done away, that he was living, as he said. This is one of the most vivid indications that the writer assumes acquaintance with the most inward experience of that disciple whom Jesus loved. Luke says that "Peter wondered in himself at that which had happened." John tells us that, from that moment, the whole thing flashed upon himself. There was something for him to see which shed a burning light upon Holy Scripture, upon the promises and acts of Jesus; and he "believed" in the triumph which had been achieved. Godet thinks more - he believed in the Messiah-ship and Sonship in a sense which had not dawned upon him before. The apostle seems to link himself with those who had the smaller and less perfect benediction subsequently pronounced upon Thomas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
