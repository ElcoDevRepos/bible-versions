The chief priests were primarily Sadducees, who held significant power in the temple and were known for their aristocratic status and collaboration with Roman authorities. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were a religious group focused on strict adherence to the Law and traditions. The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish council and court, consisting of 71 members, including the high priest. It held authority over religious and some civil matters. This convening indicates the gravity of the situation, as the Sanhedrin was called to address issues of great importance.<p><b>and said, &#8220;What are we to do?</b><br>This question reflects the leaders' concern and confusion over how to handle the growing influence of Jesus. Their question is not just about logistics but also about maintaining their authority and control over the people. The leaders were aware that Jesus' actions and teachings were challenging their power and the status quo. This moment is pivotal as it shows their internal struggle and foreshadows their eventual decision to plot against Jesus.<p><b>This man is performing many signs.</b><br>The "signs" refer to the miracles Jesus performed, which were seen as evidence of divine authority. In the Gospel of John, signs are significant as they reveal Jesus' identity and mission. The leaders' acknowledgment of these signs indicates that they could not deny the miraculous nature of Jesus' works. However, instead of leading to faith, these signs led to fear and opposition among the religious leaders. This phrase highlights the tension between the undeniable evidence of Jesus' divine power and the leaders' refusal to accept Him as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in charge of temple activities and sacrifices.

If a formal meeting of the great council, if "the Sanhedrin," had been summoned, the article would have been used. (On the Sanhedrin, see Winer, art. "Sanhedrin," in his 'Bib. R. Wort.;' Lange, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.; Edersheim, vol. 2:553, etc. This name is Greek (though Hebraized in the Talmud), and signifies the supreme court of the people, resident in Jerusalem, consisting of seventy-one members, with a president, <span class="accented">Nasi</span>, and a vice-president, <span class="accented">Ab-baith-den</span>.) Extraordinary sessions of the Sanhedrin were called at the house of the high priest, but ordinary sessions in some rooms adjoining the temple. The points submitted to their cognizance were hierarchical and religious. They had at this time lost their actual power of inflicting capital punishment. They were a court of appeal from lower courts in the province, framed after the same model. Pharisees and Sadducees were alike to be found in their number. The family of Annas, his sons, and his son-in-law Caiaphas, were all Sadducees, and embraced the priestly part of the assembly. They were the most deadly enemies of Christ throughout. The Pharisees are scarcely again mentioned in the account of the Passion. The priestly Sadducean party became also bitter enemies of Christianity and of the Church during apostolic times. Here they take the initiative. <span class="cmt_word">And they said, What are we about? because this Man</span> <span class="cmt_word">is</span> (as we must admit) <span class="cmt_word">doing many signs</span>, which will produce a perilous effect among the people. There were certain aspects and views both of the Pharisaic and Sadducean party with which our Lord's teaching coincided. When he denounced ritualism, literalism, and tradition, and laid emphasis on moral law, he had to some extent the ear of the Sadducees; when he cleansed the temple of the priestly bazaar, when he rebuked the secular conceptions of Messianic glory, the Pharisees inwardly rejoiced. Nevertheless, they had both too many g-rounds of criticism and dislike not to combine against him. The council of the nation found it a delicate and difficult task to frame charges in which the entire authorities of the nation and the popular clamor could coincide. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
