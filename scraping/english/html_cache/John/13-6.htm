Simon Peter, one of the twelve apostles, is often portrayed as impulsive and outspoken. This encounter is significant because it highlights Peter's close relationship with Jesus and sets the stage for a deeper teaching moment. The act of washing feet was a task typically reserved for servants, emphasizing Jesus' role as a servant leader. This moment foreshadows Peter's future leadership in the early church and his eventual understanding of humility and service.<p><b>who asked Him</b><br>Peter's question reflects his confusion and discomfort with Jesus performing a task that was considered lowly. In the cultural context of the time, foot washing was necessary due to the dusty roads and sandals worn by people, but it was not something a teacher or master would do for his disciples. Peter's inquiry shows his struggle to comprehend the reversal of roles and the radical nature of Jesus' actions. This moment invites readers to consider the nature of true leadership and service.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, are You going to wash my feet?&#8221;</b><br>Peter's use of "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' authority and divinity, yet his question reveals his misunderstanding of Jesus' mission. This question is pivotal as it opens the door for Jesus to explain the spiritual significance of His actions. The washing of feet symbolizes purification and the need for spiritual cleansing, pointing to the greater cleansing that Jesus would accomplish through His death and resurrection. This act also prefigures the humility and sacrifice that Jesus would demonstrate on the cross. Peter's reaction is a reminder of the human tendency to resist divine plans that challenge our expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing the act of washing His disciples' feet, demonstrating humility and servanthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and deep devotion to Christ.

It is a point of no importance, and cannot be determined. The natural impression from this verse, however, is that St. Peter's turn came after that of at least one other, and the impression from <a href="/context/john/13-24.htm" title="Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.">John 13:24-25</a> is that St. John himself, being nearest to his Master, was that other.<p><span class= "bld">Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span>--For the title, comp. <a href="/matthew/16-22.htm" title="Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from you, Lord: this shall not be to you.">Matthew 16:22</a>. The word "Thou" is to be strongly emphasised, but the common error of reading <span class= "ital">"</span>my" as an emphatic word is to be avoided. The act is in itself natural; perhaps is even one that he had expected from some of the less prominent in the apostolic band. What he cannot understand is that his Master should do it. "Lord, dost <span class= "ital">Thou</span> wash my feet?" Comp. with this feeling of the Apostle at the close of our Lord's life that of John the Baptist at its commencement (<a href="/context/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14-15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It cannot be determined with whom our Lord commenced the feet-washing. Some of the older expositors have said it was with Judas. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> might denote that several of the disciples, in awestruck wonder, had submitted without a word, and then (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> resumptive) <span class="cmt_word">he cometh to Simon Peter.</span> But the great bulk of ancient and modern expositors suppose that Peter was the first to whom this great grace was offered. At all events, in his impulsive manner always rushing forwards, and ready to give his Master advice, and to be the mouthpiece of otherwise unuttered feelings, Peter was the first to exclaim, (<span class="cmt_word">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">saith unto</span> <span class="accented">him</span>, and with strong emphasis on the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou wash my feet</span>? The protest was natural. It corresponds with many another scene in Peter's life; as when he said, "<span class="accented">Depart</span> from me; for I am a sinful man," or cried, "That be far from thee," and later on in this chapter, "Why cannot I follow thee now?" or, "I have never eaten anything common or unclean." This trait in Peter's character is wonderfully accurate, and corresponds with the portraiture of the same man in the synoptic narrative (see Introduction, p. 115.). There is here an analogous blending of reverence and self-will, of outwardness and forwardness - a new illustration of one who would distinguish himself by the greatness of his humility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Erchetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
