The "Jews" here refers to the Jewish authorities, particularly the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were responsible for maintaining religious law and order. Their increasing hostility towards Jesus was due to His actions and teachings, which they perceived as a threat to their authority and interpretation of the Law. The desire to kill Jesus reflects the severity of the conflict, as blasphemy and Sabbath-breaking were considered capital offenses under Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>).<p><b>Not only was He breaking the Sabbath,</b><br>Jesus' actions on the Sabbath, such as healing the sick, were seen as violations of the traditional Jewish Sabbath laws. The Sabbath was a day of rest, instituted by God in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), and was strictly observed by the Jewish people. However, Jesus challenged the prevailing interpretations by emphasizing the spirit of the law over the letter, teaching that acts of mercy and necessity were lawful on the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>). This reinterpretation was radical and controversial, leading to accusations of law-breaking.<p><b>but He was even calling God His own Father,</b><br>By referring to God as His own Father, Jesus was making a profound theological statement about His unique relationship with God. In Jewish culture, calling God "Father" was not uncommon, but the personal and intimate way Jesus did so implied a special status and authority. This claim was understood by the Jewish leaders as a direct challenge to their monotheistic beliefs, as it suggested a unique divine sonship that went beyond the traditional understanding of God as the Father of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>).<p><b>making Himself equal with God.</b><br>This phrase underscores the central issue of the Jewish leaders' opposition to Jesus: His claim to divinity. By equating Himself with God, Jesus was asserting His divine nature and authority, which was considered blasphemous by the Jewish authorities. This claim is consistent with other New Testament passages that affirm the deity of Christ (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). The assertion of equality with God is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, emphasizing the belief in the Trinity and the incarnation of God in Jesus Christ. This claim also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, who would be both divine and human (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose actions and claims provoke a strong reaction from the Jewish leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders and authorities who are opposing Jesus, particularly due to His actions on the Sabbath and His claims about His relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, which Jesus is accused of breaking by performing miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Jesus refers to God as His Father, which is a significant claim of His divine nature and equality with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Jesus is interacting with the Jewish leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_divinity.htm">Understanding Jesus' Divinity</a></b><br>Jesus' claim to be equal with God is central to Christian faith.

He was abrogating the petty restrictions and abolishing the unspiritual somnolence by which it had been characterized and misunderstood. But there was another and more staggering charge which they were not at that moment able to condone. They sought the more to slay him <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> <span class="cmt_word">was calling God his own</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Father, making himself equal to</span>, on a level with, <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. He did use the phrase, "my Father," with a marked emphasis. He did not say, "<span class="accented">our</span> Father, or <span class="accented">your</span> Father;" he assumed a unique relation to the Father. The inmost centre of the Divine consciousness in him thrilled through the human. Though he did not wear now the "form of God," but the "form of the Servant," yet the Servant knew that he was Son and Lord of all. The Divine Personality which had always wrought out the eternal counsels of the Father's will was working now on identical and parallel lines in the human sphere. There were senses in which the Lord Jesus was the own and only begotten Son of God. This was a hard saying. This placing of himself on a level with God was the blasphemy which the Jews resented. Jesus knew what he said, and saw the impression his words produced, and took no steps to correct it. Two classes of result naturally followed. Some said, "He blasphemeth," "He hath a devil," and the high priest subsequently, in reply to a similar utterance of the Lord, rent his clothes; but other some felt concerning him that the relation between him and the Father was, so far as they knew, absolutely unique. The author of this Gospel exclaimed, "He who 'was with God and was God' has been manifested in the flesh, and we saw his glory, the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
