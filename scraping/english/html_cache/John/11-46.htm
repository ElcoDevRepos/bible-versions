The crowd present included Jews who had come to comfort Mary and Martha. The division among the witnesses highlights the varied responses to Jesus' miracles, a recurring theme in the Gospels. This division is reminiscent of the parable of the sower, where the seed (the word of God) falls on different types of soil, representing different responses to Jesus' message.<p><b>went to the Pharisees</b><br>The Pharisees were a prominent religious group in Judea known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. They held significant influence over the Jewish people and were often in opposition to Jesus due to His teachings and actions, which they perceived as threats to their authority and interpretations of the Law. The act of going to the Pharisees indicates a deliberate choice to report Jesus' actions to those who were already hostile towards Him, suggesting a motive of opposition or concern over the implications of His miracles.<p><b>and told them what Jesus had done</b><br>The miracle of raising Lazarus was a significant demonstration of Jesus' divine authority and power over life and death, which was a direct challenge to the religious leaders' understanding of God and the Messiah. By informing the Pharisees, the witnesses were escalating the situation, leading to increased tension and plotting against Jesus. This act of reporting can be seen as fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant, as it sets in motion the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. The miracle itself is a type of Christ's own resurrection, foreshadowing His victory over death and His role as the resurrection and the life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.

The verse reminds us that physical evidence alone does not guarantee faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went to the Pharisees</b><p>&#8226; Rather than pondering the miracle, these witnesses hurry to the religious authorities who are already plotting against Jesus (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53, 57</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar informant behavior appears when the healed blind man is brought to the Pharisees (<a href="/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>) and when temple guards report Jesus&#8217; words (<a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32, 45</a>-46).<p>&#8226; This movement toward the power center highlights mounting tension: each revelation of Jesus&#8217; authority forces Israel&#8217;s leaders either to submit or to resist (<a href="/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told them</b><p>&#8226; The verb suggests deliberate, perhaps anxious reporting.

Rather than embracing the One who raises the dead, &#8220;some&#8221; rush to protect their religious system, carrying news of the miracle straight to the Pharisees. Their choice illustrates the sobering truth that witnessing Jesus&#8217; works demands a response; neutrality is impossible. Faith welcomes the Light, while unbelief seeks to extinguish it&#8212;even as the very act of opposition broadcasts His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> necessarily, some of those who had been with Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, and had believed.
