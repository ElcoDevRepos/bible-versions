It is significant in the New Testament as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. Bethany is also where Jesus often stayed during His visits to Jerusalem, indicating its importance as a place of refuge and friendship for Him. The name "Bethany" is thought to mean "house of affliction" or "house of figs," which may reflect its humble status or agricultural nature.<p><b>was near Jerusalem</b><br>The proximity of Bethany to Jerusalem is crucial in the narrative of Jesus' ministry. Being close to the religious and political center of Israel, Bethany served as a strategic location for Jesus. It allowed Him to engage with the events in Jerusalem while having a place to retreat. This closeness also highlights the tension and danger Jesus faced, as Jerusalem was the center of opposition to His ministry. The nearness underscores the immediacy of the events leading to His crucifixion.<p><b>a little less than two miles away</b><br>The specific mention of the distance, approximately two miles, emphasizes the accessibility of Bethany from Jerusalem. This short distance would have made it easy for news to travel quickly between the two locations, as seen in the account of Lazarus's death and Jesus' subsequent arrival. The measurement also reflects the Jewish custom of a Sabbath day's journey, which was about 2,000 cubits or roughly this distance, indicating that Bethany was within a permissible travel range on the Sabbath. This detail underscores the practical and cultural considerations of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A small village located near Jerusalem, known as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.

The verse quietly reminds us that God works within real places, precise distances, and exact timing, turning an ordinary village into the launching point of resurrection hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem.</span>--This way of speaking of places in the past tense is not found in the other Gospels. (Comp., in this Gospel, <a href="/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1</a>; <a href="/john/19-41.htm" title="Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.">John 19:41</a>; and, on the other hand, Note on <a href="/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>.) The explanation may be that from St. John's point of view, writing after the destruction of Jerusalem, the buildings and gardens could no longer be described as still existing.<p><span class= "bld">About fifteen furlongs off.</span>--The Greek stadium which is here rendered "furlong" was 606? English feet. The distance was, then, as the margin gives it, not much short of two English miles. This is mentioned to account for the fact stated in the following verse, that many of the Jews came to comfort Martha and Mary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem</span>. This geographical observation is introduced to explain the following verse. Meyer and Alford think that the use of the past tense, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, may be perfectly justified in making reference to past events; yet, since John is the only New Testament writer who uses it, the usage may have been adopted by him because, at the time when he wrote his Gospel, Bethany had been for the time destroyed with Jerusalem itself. The construction is peculiar: <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> (compare a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span>, <a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>; <a href="/john/21-8.htm">John 21:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-20.htm">Revelation 14:20</a>; see Winer, p. 697, Eng. trans.). Many think that it is to be understood - <span class="cmt_word">about fifteen stadia from it</span> - a kind of trajection of the preposition; but Winer thinks that it points to the spot where the fifteen stadia might be supposed to terminate, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "lying off at the end of the fifteen stadia," and so giving an adverbial force to the preposition: and he adds a long list of similar constructions in later Greek writers. The stadium was 606.75 feet - less than the eighth of an English mile; the distance was therefore between a mile and a half and a mile and three quarters. <span class="cmt_word">And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary.</span> "The Jews" is a phrase generally, not uniformly, used by John to denote those permanently hostile to our Lord, and often of the upper and ruling classes. These, therefore, had one more trial of faith, one further opportunity of recognizing his glory. <span class="accented">Many of them came</span> <span class="accented">to Martha and Mary</span>. They came to comfort them, according to ordinary usage among the Jews after bereavement. This ceremony often lasted seven days. Concerning (their) brother. We cling to earthly love. The gush of strong affection that mourners lavish on the dead deepens their love to one another, and the praises of the departed often gild and almost pierce the veil itself. The fact that <span class="accented">many</span> Jews should have taken the trouble to journey nearly two miles to comfort the bereaved sisters shows that the family at Bethany was one of some wealth, position, and importance (cf. <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a>). If so, it is exceedingly unlikely that the narrative stands in any relation to the parable of the rich man and the beggar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Bethany</span><br /><span class="grk">&#914;&#951;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(B&#275;thania)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_963.htm">Strong's 963: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Chaldee origin; date-house; Beth-any, a place in Palestine.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
