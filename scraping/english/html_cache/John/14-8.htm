His request reflects a common theme in the Gospels where the disciples seek clarity about Jesus' teachings. Philip's interactions with Jesus, such as in <a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43-46</a> and <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5-7</a>, show his practical nature and sometimes limited spiritual insight, which is evident in this request.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, show us the Father</b><br>This request echoes the deep longing for a direct revelation of God, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. In <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>, Moses asks to see God's glory, and God reveals His goodness but not His face. Philip's request indicates a desire for a tangible experience of God, reflecting the Jewish expectation of seeing God as a sign of divine favor and understanding. It also highlights the disciples' struggle to fully grasp Jesus' identity as the visible image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><b>and that will be enough for us.&#8221;</b><br>Philip's statement suggests that seeing the Father would satisfy their need for proof and understanding, revealing a common human desire for certainty in faith. This reflects the broader biblical narrative where faith often requires trust beyond physical evidence, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. The disciples' journey with Jesus is a process of moving from reliance on physical signs to spiritual understanding, a transition that Jesus continually guides them through, as seen in His teachings and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles of Jesus.

Earlier he was the disciple who eagerly invited Nathanael to meet Jesus (<a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45&#8211;46</a>) and later calculated the cost of feeding the five thousand (<a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5&#8211;7</a>). His pattern is clear: he thinks practically, asks straight-forward questions, and wants tangible proof. Here, his words spring from a heart longing for assurance in the face of Jesus&#8217; talk about departure (<a href="/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; 14:1).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Philip represents believers who crave visible confirmation.<p>&#8226; His request shows that even devoted followers can struggle to grasp spiritual realities (<a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Him</b><p>Philip directs his plea &#8220;to Him,&#8221; meaning Jesus. The disciple instinctively senses that answers about God must come through Christ. Jesus had just declared, &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). By turning to Jesus, Philip acts consistently with that declaration, even if he does not yet understand it fully.<p>Cross-references:<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/12-45.htm">John 12:45</a>&#8212;&#8220;And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;For in Christ all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lord</b><p>Calling Jesus &#8220;Lord&#8221; acknowledges His authority and deity (<a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>; 20:28). Philip does not address Jesus as merely &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; here; he uses a title that signifies ownership and sovereign rights over his life. The term underscores that Philip is not asking a casual favor but petitioning the One who bears divine authority.<p>Points to note:<p>&#8226; Recognizing Jesus as Lord is foundational before deeper revelation can occur (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>).<p>&#8226; Submission precedes understanding; Philip&#8217;s posture is humble, even if his perception is incomplete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>show us the Father</b><p>This request echoes humanity&#8217;s age-old longing: to behold God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18&#8211;23</a>). Philip is asking for a direct, visible manifestation of the Father. Yet Scripture teaches that the Son Himself is &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory and the exact representation of His nature&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). Jesus will answer in the next verse, &#8220;Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>), affirming that the clearest revelation of God is found in Christ alone (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p>Implications:<p>&#8226; The Father&#8217;s character, will, and heart are perfectly displayed in Jesus&#8217; words and works.<p>&#8226; Seeking a vision outside of Christ overlooks the sufficiency of the revelation we already have in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that will be enough for us.</b><p>Philip believes that seeing the Father will satisfy every doubt. This reveals two truths: (1) humans hunger for ultimate assurance, and (2) only God can truly satisfy that hunger. Scripture echoes this theme of sufficiency: &#8220;Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-25.htm">Psalm 73:25&#8211;26</a>). Jesus Himself is the &#8220;bread of life&#8221; who meets every need (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), and His grace is &#8220;sufficient&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>Practical reflections:<p>&#8226; True contentment is found in knowing God, and that knowledge comes through Christ.<p>&#8226; When Jesus is seen and trusted, the soul&#8217;s deepest thirst is quenched (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37&#8211;38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8</a> captures a sincere disciple asking for visible proof of God. Philip&#8217;s plea highlights human longing for certainty, yet Jesus soon reveals that the certainty Philip seeks is already present in Himself. To &#8220;see the Father&#8221; is to look at Jesus&#8212;His person, His words, His works. The verse invites believers to rest in the sufficiency of Christ as the full and final revelation of God, the One who answers every honest cry for assurance and says, in effect, &#8220;If you have Me, you have all you need.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Philip saith unto him.</span>--Comp. for the character of Philip <a href="/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/john/6-5.htm" title="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?">John 6:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="/john/12-21.htm" title="The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.">John 12:21</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> He is joined with Thomas at the head of the second group of the Apostles, in <a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</span>--He catches at the word "seen "and thinks of some revelation of the glory of God as that vouchsafed to Moses, or it may be of a vision like that which three of their number had seen, and of which others had heard, in the Mount of Transfiguration.

He is described as convinced of the Messianic character of Jesus, and able, by what he had seen and heard, to overcome all prejudices. Philip, with practical mind, took part in the conversations and preparations for our Lord's great miracle on the loaves. Philip was thought of as a suitable person to introduce the Greeks to Jesus: and every hint we obtain about him is graphic and valuable. <span class="cmt_word">Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us</span>. This query is a very natural one. Though under ordinary circumstances men cannot with mortal eyes look on God, yet one of the high purports of the Christian revelation is to make it possible that men may look and live. Theophanies of Jehovah are not infrequent. The favored prophets, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, Elijah, Isaiah, Ezekiel and others had been favored with visions of Divine majesty, and it was not unreasonable that the practical Philip, who believed in the invincible assent which personal experience would give, who not only had seen in Jesus the Messiah of their prophecies, but had said to Nathanael, "Come and <span class="accented">see</span>," and be as satisfied as I am, should now think that some gorgeous vision of the Father's face was possibly within their reach and within Christ's power to confer - a vision which would for ever scatter their doubts and enforce certitude with plausibility. B. Weiss suggests that some whisper of the Transfiguration-glory had escaped from the favored three, leading the other disciples to desire a corresponding theophany. As Luther says, "His faith flutters up into the clouds." A dazzling spectacle would satisfy and suffice for all needs. To see and know the Father, to have irresistible evidence that the Eternal Power is one who has begotten us from himself, and both knows and loves us, is the highest and most sacred yearning of the human heart. The desire is implanted by God himself. Philip, with his fellow-disciples, had not vet learned the sacred truth that they had already had the opportunity of seeing in the life of the God Man the most explicit manifestation of the Father. A dazzling phenomenon, outside of Christ, might have given to the disciples a new impression of awe and fear like that which fell on Moses and the elders of Israel, on Isaiah and Elijah; yet a far more comprehensive revelation of Divine perfection, inspiring the spirit of obedience, reverence, trust, and love, devotion, and self-sacrifice, had already been made to them, but their eyes were holden. They were not satisfied, or Philip would not have said <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Philip</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Philippos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5376.htm">Strong's 5376: </a> </span><span class="str2">From philos and hippos; fond of horses; Philippus, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
