This statement follows His teaching on being the Bread of Life, which many found difficult to accept. The context is crucial, as Jesus had just performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000, demonstrating His divine power and authority. Despite witnessing such miracles, some disciples struggled with faith, illustrating the human tendency to doubt even in the face of evidence. This reflects the broader biblical theme of belief and unbelief, seen throughout Scripture, such as in the Israelites' journey in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>) and the persistent call to faith in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><b>(For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe</b><br>This phrase underscores Jesus' divine omniscience, affirming His knowledge of human hearts and intentions. From the beginning of His ministry, Jesus was aware of the true nature of those who followed Him. This foreknowledge is consistent with the portrayal of God in the Old Testament, who knows the thoughts and hearts of individuals (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). It also aligns with the New Testament depiction of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), possessing divine attributes. This insight into human belief and unbelief is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus often discerns the faith or lack thereof in those He encounters (<a href="/mark/2-8.htm">Mark 2:8</a>, <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<p><b>and who would betray Him.)</b><br>This part of the verse specifically refers to Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, who would later betray Jesus to the religious authorities. The betrayal by Judas is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. Judas' actions are a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative, leading to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion. This betrayal highlights the theme of human free will and divine sovereignty, as Judas' choice to betray Jesus was foreknown yet freely made. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the potential for betrayal and sin within the human heart, even among those closest to Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples and followers, revealing His divine knowledge of their hearts and future actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The group of followers who are with Jesus.

They had heard, it may be, the Sermon on the Mount, and such teaching as that of Matthew 13. In part they could understand this, and therefore in part believed; but when faith was really needed, it was found not really to exist: for faith is accepting what is not demonstrable to the mere reason, and seeing what is invisible.<p><span class= "bld">From the beginning.</span>--This is a relative term, and is to be interpreted from the context. It means here the beginning of their discipleship. He saw in their hearts the varying kinds of ground on which the good seed fell, and in their acts and words the varying effects. There were hearts like the hardened wayside, but it may have been ploughed; like the stony places, but that shelving rock may have been broken through; like the thorns, but they may have been rooted up; and all may have become, as some were, like the good and fruit-bearing ground.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But, he adds,</span> <span class="cmt_word">there are some of you that believe not</span>. "Some," not many, who were following him yet felt that they could not trust - could not accept his greatest revelations, these Divine assumptions, this spiritual position of his. The Divine humanity, the offered life, the cruel death, of the Son of God, the victory over death, the return to the Father, when put into words or when taught in metaphors even, were grounds of offence. The evangelist adds: <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> introduces the explanatory clause of the disciple who testified of these things) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus knew</span> (knew absolutely, rather than came to know) <span class="cmt_word">from the beginning</span> - referring to the commencement of his public ministry, when men began to close round him (<a href="/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43, 48</a>; <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24</a>), not from the beginning of time, or the beginning of their unbelief (Kling); he knew by his Divine penetration into their character, by their manner and spirit, and the nakedness and openness of all hearts before him - <span class="cmt_word">who</span> <span class="cmt_word">they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.</span> Westcott here reminds us that the first indication of the sin of Judas occurs in close association with predictions of the approaching Passion. This foreknowledge of issues is no interference with free self-consciousness in itself. It may imply that the natures thus known contained in themselves the seeds of the future growth. He knew what would be, but he did not compel it. There was possibly some fresh manifestation of feeling, of failing sympathy, even of enmity, which led the evangelist to notice the manner and interpret the mind of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-64.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
