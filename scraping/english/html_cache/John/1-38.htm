The act of Jesus turning signifies His awareness and willingness to engage with those seeking Him. In biblical context, turning often symbolizes a readiness to reveal truth or to invite a deeper relationship. The disciples' following indicates their desire to learn more about Jesus, reflecting the cultural practice of disciples seeking out rabbis to follow and learn from.<p><b>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; He asked.</b><br>Jesus' question is direct and probing, inviting the disciples to articulate their intentions and desires. This question is not merely about physical needs but is an invitation to express their spiritual longing. It echoes God's frequent invitations in the Old Testament for His people to seek Him with their whole heart, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>. It also sets the stage for a deeper relationship, as Jesus often used questions to lead individuals to self-reflection and revelation.<p><b>They said to Him, &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; (which means Teacher),</b><br>By addressing Jesus as "Rabbi," the disciples acknowledge His authority and role as a spiritual teacher. This title reflects the Jewish tradition of respect and reverence for those who interpret and teach the Scriptures. The parenthetical explanation indicates the Gospel's audience includes those unfamiliar with Jewish customs, suggesting a broader, possibly Gentile readership. This title also foreshadows Jesus' role as the ultimate Teacher, whose wisdom surpasses that of any earthly rabbi.<p><b>&#8220;where are You staying?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' question reveals their desire for more than a brief encounter; they seek to spend time with Jesus, to learn from Him, and to understand His teachings. In the cultural context, staying with a rabbi meant living closely and learning through daily interactions. This inquiry signifies a commitment to discipleship, echoing the call to abide in Christ as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>. It also prefigures the intimate relationship Jesus offers to all believers, inviting them to dwell with Him spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is beginning His public ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically, two of John the Baptist's disciples who begin to follow Jesus, seeking to learn from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabbi.htm">Rabbi</a></b><br>A term of respect meaning "Teacher," indicating the disciples' recognition of Jesus' authority and wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_encounter.htm">The Encounter</a></b><br>This event marks the beginning of the disciples' journey with Jesus, highlighting their desire to know Him more deeply.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>This takes place shortly after John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the "Lamb of God," prompting his disciples to follow Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_jesus.htm">Seeking Jesus</a></b><br>The disciples' question, "Where are You staying?" reflects a deeper spiritual longing to be in the presence of Jesus.

They inquire, "Where dost thou sojourn?" "Where are you staying for the night?" They will visit Him and ask the many things they seek. They address Him as "Rabbi," placing themselves in the position of His scholars; but they have not yet learnt all that John had taught them of His office. The title is natural from them, for it was the then current title of a revered teacher, and one that John's disciples applied to him (<a href="/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a>); but the writer remembers it was a modern word (comp. <a href="/context/matthew/23-7.htm" title="And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.">Matthew 23:7-8</a>), known to Jews only since the days of Hillel (president of the Sanhedrin about B.C. 30), not likely to be known to Greeks at all, and he therefore translates it, as he does Messias and Cephas in this same section.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jesus turned</span> - hearing their footfall, he welcomed their sincere approach, attentive as he ever was to the faintest indication of genuine faith and desire for his best gifts - <span class="cmt_word">and beheld them following</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is used of intense gaze at that which is august and wonderful, vers. 14, 32; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>; but used also of special and interested contemplation, <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and he saith to them, What seek ye?</span> The first words of Jesus, as recorded in this Gospel, reveal the incarnate Logos, anointed of the Holy Spirit, beginning to search the heart and anticipate the unuttered questions of humanity.

They, on seeing their Christ, the Son of God, all humanly before them, do not fall at his feet, but approach him as a human teacher, and give him the ordinary honorific title of a wise, competent instructor. <span class="cmt_word">They said unto him, Rabbi</span> (<span class="cmt_word">which is, being interpreted, Teacher</span>). The parenthetic clause reveals the fact that the Gospel was written for Gentile readers. The title "Rabbi" was a modern one, only dating from the days of Hillel, about <span class="date">B.C. 30</span>, and therefore needing interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Where abidest thou?</span> Renan founds on this phrase "Rabbi" the supposition that, when John and Jesus meet, they are <span class="accented">both</span> surrounded by groups of followers. The narrative is written to convey a precisely opposite conception. Christ did not refuse this "courtesy title" (<a href="/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a>; <a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>), and we can gather nothing else from the narrative. The question itself reveals the mind of the evangelist. In the opinion of all writers (favourable and hostile), the writer, according to a deliberate method adopted by him, wished to imply that he was one of the two disciples who first left the Baptist to attach themselves to Jesus. The very form of the question adds to the probability. It is a characteristic longing of the disciple, whom Jesus loved so well, to be near and with his Master. He craved no laconic phrase, no solitary word, but some more prolonged fellowship, some undisturbed communion and instruction. The varied emotions of that day, moreover, were conspicuously reproduced in the solemn title which the son of Zebedee most persistently applied to his glorified Lord in the Apocalypse. More than thirty times he refers to him as "the Lamb." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Strapheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4762.htm">Strong's 4762: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened from the base of trope; to twist, i.e. Turn quite around or reverse.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#949;&#945;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(theasamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2300.htm">Strong's 2300: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to look closely at, i.e. perceive; by extension to visit.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
