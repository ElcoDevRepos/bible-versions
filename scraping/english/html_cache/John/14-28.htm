In the context of the Last Supper, Jesus prepares His disciples for His imminent crucifixion, resurrection, and eventual ascension. The promise of His return can be seen as both His post-resurrection appearances and His second coming. This duality is consistent with the Jewish understanding of the Messiah's role, which includes both suffering and reigning. The assurance of His return provides hope and continuity for the disciples, aligning with prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>.<p><b>If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father,</b><br>Here, Jesus challenges the disciples' understanding of love and faith. The statement implies that true love for Jesus would recognize the significance of His return to the Father. This return signifies the completion of His earthly mission and the beginning of His heavenly intercession. Theologically, it underscores the importance of Jesus' ascension, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, where He serves as the high priest. The disciples' sorrow at His departure is natural, yet Jesus calls them to a higher understanding of His divine purpose.<p><b>because the Father is greater than I.</b><br>This phrase has been the subject of much theological discussion. It emphasizes the functional subordination of the Son to the Father during His earthly ministry, without implying inequality in essence or nature. This aligns with the doctrine of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-equal and co-eternal. The statement reflects Jesus' humility and obedience, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>, where He willingly submits to the Father's will. It also highlights the relational dynamic within the Godhead, where Jesus' return to the Father signifies the restoration of His pre-incarnate glory, as mentioned in <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, speaking to His disciples about His departure and return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, struggling to understand His impending departure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, to whom Jesus refers as greater, emphasizing the divine relationship within the Trinity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_jesus'_departure.htm">The Event of Jesus' Departure</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus' crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_jesus'_return.htm">The Event of Jesus' Return</a></b><br>Points to both His resurrection appearances and His second coming.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_trinity.htm">Understanding the Trinity</a></b><br>Jesus' statement about the Father being greater does not imply inequality in essence but rather a functional subordination within the Trinity.

Their sorrow at His departure was at its root selfish, as all sorrow for those who depart to be with God is, however little we think so. His departure would be the return to the glory of the Father's throne, and was matter for joy and not for sorrow. For them also it was expedient. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/john/16-6.htm" title="But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.">John 16:6-7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For my Father is greater than I.</span>--These words have naturally formed the subject of controversy in every period of the Church's history, between those who deny and those who accept the truth that the Son is "very God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before all worlds." And, as in all controversies, statements have been made on either side which cannot be supported by the words themselves. On the part of those who assert the divine nature, it has been contended that the Father is greater than the Son only as regards the human nature of the Son; but this is not here thought of. In this passage, as in others of the New Testament, it is plainly asserted that in the divine nature there is a subordination of the Son to the Father. (See, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.
