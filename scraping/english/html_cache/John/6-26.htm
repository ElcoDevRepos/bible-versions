In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, Jesus is addressing the crowd that followed Him after the feeding of the 5,000. His reply often serves to correct misunderstandings or to reveal deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>Truly, truly, I tell you</b><br>The repetition of "truly" (Greek: "amen, amen") emphasizes the importance and certainty of what Jesus is about to say. This phrase is used frequently in the Gospel of John to introduce significant teachings or revelations. It underscores the authority of Jesus' words and invites the listener to pay close attention.<p><b>it is not because you saw these signs</b><br>The "signs" refer to the miracles Jesus performed, particularly the feeding of the 5,000, which is a key event in this chapter. In the Gospel of John, signs are meant to reveal Jesus' divine nature and mission. However, Jesus points out that the crowd's motivation is not rooted in understanding these signs as revelations of His identity.<p><b>that you are looking for Me</b><br>The crowd's pursuit of Jesus is driven by immediate, physical needs rather than spiritual insight. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where people seek Jesus for temporal benefits rather than eternal truths. It challenges readers to examine their own motivations in seeking Christ.<p><b>but because you ate the loaves and had your fill</b><br>This phrase highlights the physical satisfaction the crowd experienced from the miracle of the loaves and fishes. It underscores the human tendency to focus on material needs. Jesus uses this moment to redirect their attention from physical sustenance to the spiritual nourishment He offers, which is a recurring theme in His teachings. This also foreshadows His later discourse on being the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), drawing a parallel between physical and spiritual sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd following Him after the miracle of feeding the 5,000.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>These are the people who followed Jesus after witnessing the miracle of the loaves and fishes.
