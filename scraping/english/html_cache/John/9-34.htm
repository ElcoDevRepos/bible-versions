This belief is rooted in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God speaks of visiting "the iniquity of the fathers on the children." The Pharisees' response to the healed man reveals their adherence to this doctrine, which Jesus challenges earlier in <a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>, stating that the man's blindness was not due to sin but so that the works of God might be displayed in him. This accusation also highlights the Pharisees' spiritual blindness and their inability to see beyond the law to the grace and power of God.<p><b>and you are instructing us?&#8221;</b><br>The Pharisees' rhetorical question underscores their pride and perceived superiority as religious leaders. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judaism, the Pharisees were respected as experts in the Law of Moses and religious traditions. Their question is laced with sarcasm and indignation, as they cannot fathom being taught by someone they consider a sinner and socially inferior. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God often uses the humble and lowly to confound the wise, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>, where God chooses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.<p><b>And they threw him out.</b><br>This action signifies the man's excommunication from the synagogue, a severe punishment in Jewish society that meant social and religious isolation. Being cast out of the synagogue was not just a personal rejection but a communal one, affecting one's ability to participate in religious and social life. This expulsion is symbolic of the broader rejection of Jesus by the religious authorities, as they refuse to accept the truth of His miracles and teachings. It also foreshadows the growing division between the early Christian community and traditional Jewish structures, as believers in Jesus were increasingly marginalized. This act of casting out parallels the rejection Jesus Himself faced, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, demonstrating the power and compassion of Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were skeptical of Jesus and questioned the healed man, ultimately rejecting his testimony.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man, revealing His divine authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>The place where the healed man was questioned and ultimately expelled, representing the religious establishment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_healing.htm">The Miracle of Healing</a></b><br>The event where Jesus heals the blind man, serving as a sign of His messianic identity and divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness_vs._physical_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness vs. Physical Blindness</a></b><br>The Pharisees' inability to see the truth of Jesus' identity highlights the danger of spiritual blindness, which is more debilitating than physical blindness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pride_and_humility.htm">Pride and Humility</a></b><br>The Pharisees' pride prevented them from accepting the truth from someone they deemed inferior.

The light of truth exposes their hypocrisy, much like Jesus&#8217; earlier words in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>.<p>&#8226; Religious leaders often responded to Jesus and His followers with hostility when confronted (<a href="/john/8-13.htm">John 8:13</a>; <a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53-54</a>). This shows that mere religious status does not guarantee spiritual sight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You were born in utter sin</b><p>&#8226; They assume his former blindness proved God&#8217;s judgment on him from birth (<a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>). This echoes the mistaken notion of Job&#8217;s friends who linked suffering to personal sin (<a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches that all are born with a sinful nature (<a href="/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>; <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>), yet the Pharisees single him out to dodge their own guilt.<p>&#8226; Their statement contradicts Jesus&#8217; earlier clarification: &#8220;Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>). God&#8217;s purposes, not karma-like retribution, lay behind the man&#8217;s former blindness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you are instructing us?</b><p>&#8226; Pride surfaces. They dismiss him because he lacks formal rabbinic training, mirroring their scorn for the crowd in <a href="/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48-49</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride precedes a fall. God still chooses &#8220;the foolish things of the world to shame the wise&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; By refusing correction, they reveal their own spiritual blindness (<a href="/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). The healed man sees physically and spiritually; they remain blind in both senses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they threw him out</b><p>&#8226; This expulsion likely fulfills the threat in <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> that anyone confessing Jesus as Messiah would be &#8220;put out of the synagogue.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Being cast out meant social, religious, and economic isolation, yet Jesus later seeks him out (<a href="/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35</a>), fulfilling promises such as <a href="/isaiah/66-5.htm">Isaiah 66:5</a> and <a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>&#8212;God honors those rejected for His name.<p>&#8226; The man loses earthly approval but gains eternal fellowship with Christ, illustrating the cost and reward of discipleship (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34</a> exposes hard-hearted pride. The Pharisees, confronted with undeniable evidence of Jesus&#8217; power, cling to status and tradition. They label the healed man a sinner, dismiss his testimony, and expel him to maintain control. Their reaction underscores these truths:<p>&#8226; Religious privilege cannot replace humble faith.<p>&#8226; Misjudging others&#8217; suffering blinds us to God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Pride rejects correction, while humility receives sight.<p>In the end, the one cast out by men is welcomed by the Son of God, confirming that true sight comes only through Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Thou wast altogether born in sins.</span>--Their reproach now takes the most malignant form, and shrinks not from casting in his teeth the calamity of his birth as the mark of special sin. "Thou didst come into the world," these words mean, "bearing the curse of God upon thy face. Thou hast said that God heareth not sinners. Thy life in its first moments bore the marks of some fearful crime."<p><span class= "bld">And dost thou teach us?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "Dost <span class= "ital">thou,</span> marked more than is the common lot of man by sin, teach <span class= "ital">us,</span> who are the authorised teachers and expositors of the truth?" For any one to have doubted their authority would have seemed out of question; but here was one who had been a beggar, one of the "people of the earth," untrained in the Law, and therefore cursed (comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-49.htm" title="But this people who knows not the law are cursed.">John 7:49</a>), and, more than this, altogether born in sin, who was actually teaching them!<p><span class= "bld">And they cast him out.</span>--These words are generally taken to mean excommunication, as in the margin, and it is certain that they may have this sense. (Comp. <a href="/3_john/1-10.htm" title="Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.">3John 1:10</a>.) Having this meaning before them, our translators did not, however, think it the better one, and their view seems to be borne out by the general impression which we get from the narrative. The man with all his boldness has not technically fallen under the ban they had threatened, for he has not "confessed that He was Christ" (<a href="/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>). A decree of the Sanhedrin would have been necessary, and this must have been formally pronounced. Now, we feel that in a detailed narrative such as we have here, all this would hardly be told in a single short sentence. It seems to be rather that their anger has now passed all bounds. They cannot refute the truth which, in his honest, homely way, he has put before them. They can only heap reproaches upon him, and thrust him by force out of their presence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Vanquished by this logic of simple fact and plain inference, the authorities have no other weapon to use but invective and persecution. <span class="cmt_word">They answered and said to him, Thou wast altogether born in sins</span>; through and through a born reprobate. They take up the superstitious idea which seems (ver. 2) to have been floating in the mind of the disciples. From sins of parents or from thine own sins in thy mother's womb, thou earnest into the world with the brand of thy infamy upon thee. Thus they admit the change that has come over him by reverting to the peculiar depravity which had been stamped upon his brow, according to their narrow interpretation of Divine providence. <span class="cmt_word">And dost thou presume to teach us?</span> - the chosen, the learned, the approved ministers of God? Dost thou, with all this heritage and mark of separation from God, dare to instruct the chief pastors and teachers of Israel? They did not stop with cruel words, but in their bitterness of spirit <span class="cmt_word">they thrust him forth</span>; they violently expelled him from the synagogue where they were then seated (so Meyer, Maldonatus, Bengel, and many others). We are not told that there and then they excommunicated, or unsynagogued, him. It is probable that this ban followed, with the usual terrible formalities. He had practically confessed that the highest claims which Jesus had ever made about himself were true, and he made himself liable to the curse already pronounced (ver. 22). This marvelous narrative, with its lifelike detail, is not made the text of a discourse. It remains forever the startling vindication of our Lord's own word, that he was Light to the world and Eyesight too, and was able to supply both the objective condition and subjective change by which the nature of man could alone receive the light of life. From ver. 8 to ver. 34 is almost the only passage in the Gospel, with the exception of the passage, <a href="/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22-36</a>, in which we are not standing in the actual presence of the Lord, or are not listening to his judgments on men and things, and to his revelations of the mystery of his own Person. The narrative so far stands by itself, and gives us an insight into the life which was being enacted in Jerusalem contemporaneously with the Divine self-revelation of Jesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(sy)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
