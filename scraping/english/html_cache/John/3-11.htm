The repetition of "truly" underscores the certainty and authority of His words. In Jewish tradition, "amen" is a declaration of affirmation, and its use here signifies the weight of divine truth.<p><b>we speak of what we know</b><br>Jesus refers to the knowledge that He and His followers possess, which is rooted in divine revelation and personal experience. This contrasts with the limited understanding of the religious leaders of the time, who relied heavily on human tradition and interpretation. The use of "we" may indicate the collective witness of Jesus and the prophets or the broader testimony of the Trinity.<p><b>and we testify to what we have seen</b><br>The concept of testimony is central to Jewish legal proceedings, where the testimony of witnesses is crucial for establishing truth. Jesus, as the ultimate witness, speaks from firsthand experience of heavenly realities. This phrase also connects to the role of the Holy Spirit, who testifies to the truth of Christ's words and works.<p><b>and yet you people do not accept our testimony</b><br>Here, Jesus addresses the unbelief of His audience, particularly the religious leaders who were resistant to His message. This rejection fulfills the prophetic pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where God's messengers were often dismissed or persecuted.

"We speak that we do know" is in sharp contrast to their formal teaching of matters external to the truth. The plural is not usual in the language of Christ, and the immediate passage to the singular forbids us to accept the usual grammatical explanation that it is the plural of majesty. He apparently joins others with Himself,--those who have spoken and known and testified, and whose testimony has been rejected by the Jews. We have to think of him whose life-work was to bear witness of the Light (<a href="/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>), and of the band of disciples who form a little school round their Master, and who in Jerusalem, as in Galilee, testified of Him; and it may even be that in the house and presence of one of that band this conversation took place (comp. <a href="/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>). They knew the power of the new life, and had been baptised of water and of spirit. In their measure and degree, as He in fulness, they spake what they knew, and testified what they had seen. (Comp. <a href="/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And ye receive not our witness</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "ye Jews," the teachers, of whom Nicodemus was one, the representatives of His own who received Him not (<a href="/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a>). This attitude of the mind which refused to accept the evidence of witnesses as to things they had known and seen was of the essence of unbelief, and made further revelation impossible. When the will closed the faculty of faith, it left open no access for fuller spiritual truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say to</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee, We speak that which we know, and testify that which we have seen.</span> Lucke and Meyer think that our Lord here merely uses the <span class="accented">pluralis majestaticus</span> - uses it as St. Paul does, when clearly he was referring to himself alone.
