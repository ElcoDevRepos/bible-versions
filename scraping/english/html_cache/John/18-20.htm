This statement highlights His public ministry, which was accessible to all, contrasting with the secretive nature of His accusers. His openness fulfills the prophetic role of the Messiah as a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The phrase "to the world" indicates the universal scope of His message, not limited to a specific group.<p><b>Jesus answered.</b><br>This response is part of Jesus' trial before the high priest, showcasing His calm and composed demeanor in the face of false accusations. His answer reflects His authority and confidence in the truth of His mission. It also fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant who would be oppressed and afflicted yet remain silent (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<p><b>I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple,</b><br>Jesus' teaching locations were central to Jewish religious life. Synagogues were community centers for teaching and worship, while the temple in Jerusalem was the heart of Jewish worship and sacrifice.

It also highlights the fulfillment of <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where the Lord is prophesied to come to His temple.<p><b>where all the Jews come together.</b><br>This phrase indicates the communal aspect of Jewish worship and learning. The temple and synagogues were gathering places for Jews from various regions, especially during festivals. Jesus' teachings reached a wide audience, fulfilling the promise of a shepherd who would gather His people (<a href="/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12-13</a>).<p><b>I said nothing in secret.</b><br>Jesus contrasts His open ministry with the clandestine plots of His enemies. His transparency is a testament to His integrity and the truth of His message. This openness is consistent with His identity as the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), who exposes darkness and reveals truth.

The pronoun is strongly emphatic; "I am one," His words mean, "who spake plainly and to all men." "My followers have not been initiated into secret mysteries, nor made conspirators in any political organisation." "I have not been a leader, and they have not been members, of a party."<p><span class= "bld">I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort.</span>--The better reading omits the article before "synagogue," as in <a href="/john/6-59.htm" title="These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.">John 6:59</a>, and reads for the last clause, <span class= "ital">where all the Jews resort.</span> "In synagogue" is an adverbial phrase, as we say "in church." His constant custom was to teach "in synagogue," and in Jerusalem He taught in the temple itself, which was the resort of all the leaders of the people. This refers to His general custom, and does not, of course, exclude His teaching in other places. The point is that during His public ministry He was constantly in the habit of teaching under the authority of the officers of the synagogues and the temple. That was the answer as to what His doctrine had been.<p><span class= "bld">And in secret have I said nothing.</span>--His private teaching of the disciples is, of course, not excluded, but that was only the exposition of His public doctrine. There was nothing in it such as they understood by "secret teaching." It was unlike "the leaven of the Pharisees which was hypocrisy;" for in it there was "nothing covered," "nothing hid." (Comp. <a href="/context/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1-3</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered him, I have frankly</span> (so Meyer, Lange; not "openly," but boldly, with freedom of speech) spoken to the world.

Christ here repudiates esoteric teaching distinct from his abundant public ministry. It is true he explained his parables to his disciples, and he had within the last few hours poured forth the depth of his feelings upon them; still, he had said the same things virtually in the synagogues, on the hillside, in the temple, in the hearing of Greek as well as Jew. Much of that which he had just said in the upper chamber, hundreds and thousands had already heard. This great utterance accounts for the fact that St. Paul had received, long before the Fourth Gospel was written, truth allied to the teaching of the upper chamber. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(Eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
