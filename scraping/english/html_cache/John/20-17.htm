The Greek word used here can mean "to hold on to" or "to touch," suggesting that Mary was physically holding onto Jesus. This moment signifies that His earthly ministry is complete, and a new phase is beginning. It reflects the transition from a physical presence to a spiritual one, as Jesus prepares to ascend to the Father.<p><b>for I have not yet ascended to the Father.</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of Jesus' ascension, which is a crucial event in Christian theology. The ascension marks the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and His return to divine glory. It also sets the stage for the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The ascension is prophesied in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, and is fulfilled in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. Jesus' return to the Father signifies His exaltation and the beginning of His intercessory role for believers.<p><b>But go and tell My brothers,</b><br>Jesus refers to His disciples as "brothers," indicating a deep, familial relationship. This term of endearment shows the transformation of the disciples' status through Jesus' death and resurrection. It also fulfills the promise of adoption into God's family, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>. The instruction to "go and tell" emphasizes the role of believers as witnesses to the resurrection, a theme that is central to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.<p><b>&#8216;I am ascending to My Father and your Father,</b><br>By saying "My Father and your Father," Jesus underscores the shared relationship believers have with God through Him. This statement reflects the fulfillment of the promise of sonship and the intimate relationship believers can have with God. It echoes the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches His followers to address God as "Our Father" (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). This shared fatherhood is a result of the reconciliation achieved through Jesus' sacrifice.<p><b>to My God and your God.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and distinction in the relationship between Jesus, God, and believers. While Jesus is divine, He acknowledges God as His God, highlighting His role as the Son and His submission to the Father. For believers, this statement reaffirms their access to God through Jesus. It connects to the covenant relationship established in the Old Testament, where God declares, "I will be their God, and they will be My people" (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). This relationship is now fully realized in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ who appears to Mary Magdalene.

The words themselves must be carefully considered. "Touch" represents a Greek word which means to "cling to," to "fasten on," to "grasp" an object. The tense is present, and the prohibition is, therefore, not of an individual act, but of a continuance of the act, of the habit, "Do not continue clinging to Me." Her act supposed a condition which had not yet been accomplished. He had not returned to earth to abide permanently with His disciples in the presence of the Paraclete (comp. <a href="/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>), for He had not yet ascended to the Father. There should come a permanent closeness of union in His presence in the soul; but then the spirit which her act was manifesting was one which would prevent this presence. The coming of the Paraclete depended upon His going to the Father (comp. <a href="/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>), but she would cling to a visible presence, and has not learnt the truth so hard to learn, "It is expedient for you that I go away" (<a href="/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But go to my brethren, and say unto them.</span>--Comp.

There is a special force in the word "brethren" as spoken by the risen Lord, in that it declares the continuance of His human nature.
