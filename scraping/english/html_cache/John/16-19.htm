This reflects His intimate knowledge of human hearts, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. The disciples' confusion is understandable given the complexity of Jesus' teachings about His death and resurrection.<p><b>Jesus said to them</b><br>Jesus often addressed His disciples directly to clarify His teachings. This personal approach highlights His role as a teacher and shepherd, guiding His followers through difficult concepts. It also emphasizes the relational aspect of His ministry, where He engages with His disciples' doubts and questions.<p><b>Are you asking one another why I said</b><br>The disciples frequently discussed Jesus' teachings among themselves, as seen in other instances like <a href="/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10</a>. This reflects a common practice in Jewish culture, where disciples would debate and discuss their rabbi's teachings to gain deeper understanding. Jesus' question indicates His desire for them to seek understanding directly from Him.<p><b>&#8216;In a little while you will not see Me</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' impending death and burial. The "little while" signifies the short period between His crucifixion and resurrection. This prophecy is consistent with Jesus' earlier predictions of His death, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>. The temporary nature of their separation is emphasized, offering hope amidst the coming sorrow.<p><b>and then after a little while you will see Me&#8217;</b><br>This part of the prophecy points to Jesus' resurrection, when He would appear to His disciples again. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-11</a>.

As earlier in <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, He &#8220;knew all men,&#8221; and with Nathanael He could say, &#8220;I saw you while you were under the fig tree&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>). He does not need anyone to inform Him of the disciples&#8217; confusion.<p>&#8226; The statement reveals His divine omniscience&#8212;He reads hearts just as <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a> declares the LORD does.<p>&#8226; For the disciples, this means their unspoken fears are already on His radar; He shepherds them before they even voice a word (cf. <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus said to them</b><p>&#8220;Jesus said to them&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rather than waiting for them to stumble through their doubts, He initiates. In the Upper Room He has been leading the conversation all along (<a href="/bsb/john/13.htm">John 13-16</a>), and now He steps in again.<p>&#8226; His initiative models how He still deals with believers: He draws near first (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>), reminding them that access to Him is never blocked by their uncertainty.<p>&#8226; By speaking, He also shifts their gaze from horizontal discussion to vertical dependence. They do not need to rely on one another&#8217;s guesses when the Living Word (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>) is present to clarify.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Are you asking one another why I said&#8230;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus exposes the very topic they were whispering about. This gentle question surfaces their hidden struggle without shaming them.<p>&#8226; Throughout the Gospels He uses questions to teach (<a href="/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17-21</a>). Here the question invites the disciples to admit ignorance so that He can replace it with understanding (cf. <a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a> on the Emmaus road).<p>&#8226; The form of the question also reminds us that spiritual insight does not come by mere group discussion but by revelation from Christ Himself (<a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;In a little while you will not see Me, and then after a little while you will see Me&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; Literally, within hours the disciples would lose sight of Jesus as He was arrested, tried, and crucified (<a href="/bsb/john/18.htm">John 18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Just &#8220;a little while&#8221; later&#8212;on the third day&#8212;they would see Him alive (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-20</a>). Their sorrow would turn to joy exactly as He promises in <a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20-22</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at the larger pattern of His departure and return. After the resurrection appearances He ascended (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>), and believers now wait &#8220;a little while&#8221; for His visible return (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>).<p>&#8226; For every follower of Christ, this assures that apparent absence is temporary; the risen Lord keeps His word to come again, both personally in resurrection fellowship now (<a href="/john/14-18.htm">John 14:18-19</a>) and ultimately in glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/16-19.htm">John 16:19</a> shows Jesus&#8217; loving omniscience and proactive care. He reads the disciples&#8217; unspoken questions, steps in to address them, and anchors their hearts with the promise of His death-resurrection sequence: a brief separation followed by joyous reunion. The verse calls believers today to rest in the same truth&#8212;He knows our concerns before we voice them, He speaks through His Word to settle them, and His temporary absence will soon give way to face-to-face joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Now Jesus knew they were desirous to ask him.</span>--The purpose of His enigmatic saying (<a href="/john/16-29.htm" title="His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.">John 16:29</a>) has been accomplished.
