The Greek word for "example" (hypodeigma) implies a pattern or model to be followed. This act is significant because it was customary for the lowest servant to wash the feet of guests, highlighting Jesus' role as a servant leader. This example is not just about the physical act of washing feet but embodies the broader principle of serving others selflessly. Jesus' life consistently demonstrated this principle, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to death on a cross.<p><b>so that you should do</b><br>The phrase "so that you should do" indicates a direct call to action for the disciples. It emphasizes the importance of not just understanding Jesus' teachings but actively living them out. This aligns with <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be doers of the word, not merely hearers. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on honor and status, making Jesus' call to serve others countercultural and radical. This directive challenges believers to adopt a lifestyle of humility and service, reflecting the heart of Christ in their daily interactions.<p><b>as I have done for you</b><br>Jesus' statement "as I have done for you" personalizes the example He set, making it specific to the disciples' experience. This phrase underscores the relational aspect of Jesus' ministry, where He personally invested in His followers. The act of washing the disciples' feet foreshadows the ultimate act of service&#8212;His sacrificial death on the cross. It also connects to the Old Testament prophecies of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who would bear the sins of many. By instructing His disciples to follow His example, Jesus establishes a new standard of leadership and community within the early church, one based on love, humility, and self-sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who sets the example for His disciples by washing their feet, demonstrating humility and servanthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' example, they are called to follow His model of humble service to one another.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Jesus shares the Last Supper with His disciples and performs the act of foot washing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foot_washing.htm">Foot Washing</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus washes the feet of His disciples, symbolizing humility, service, and purification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>The Jewish festival being celebrated, which adds a layer of significance to Jesus' actions as He prepares His disciples for His impending crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_model_of_humility.htm">The Model of Humility</a></b><br>Jesus' act of washing the disciples' feet is a profound demonstration of humility.
