In the context of <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, Jesus is addressing the skepticism of the Jewish leaders. The works He refers to include healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and raising the dead, which are consistent with the messianic prophecies found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>. These acts serve as evidence of His divine authority and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.<p><b>even though you do not believe Me</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges the disbelief of His audience, particularly the religious leaders who were resistant to His message. This disbelief is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as seen in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>, where it states that He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him. The skepticism of the Jewish leaders is rooted in their expectations of a political Messiah and their inability to recognize Jesus' spiritual mission.<p><b>believe the works themselves</b><br>Jesus appeals to the evidence of His works as a basis for belief. This is a call to recognize the divine power and authority behind His miracles, which testify to His identity as the Son of God. The works are meant to lead the observers to faith, as seen in <a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>, where the purpose of the recorded signs is to lead to belief in Jesus as the Christ.<p><b>so that you may know and understand</b><br>The purpose of believing in the works is to lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of Jesus' relationship with the Father. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but involves a relational and experiential understanding of who Jesus is. The Greek terms used here imply a progressive and growing comprehension, which is a theme throughout John's Gospel.<p><b>that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the unity and intimate relationship between Jesus and the Father, a central theme in the Gospel of John. It reflects the concept of perichoresis, the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son, which is foundational to Trinitarian theology. This unity is further elaborated in <a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10-11</a> and is crucial for understanding the divine nature of Jesus. The statement also echoes the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, affirming the oneness of God while revealing the distinct persons within the Godhead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Jews, explaining His divine relationship with the Father through His works.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, with whom Jesus claims unity, emphasizing the divine nature of His mission and works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, many of whom are skeptical of His claims and are seeking evidence of His divinity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_works.htm">The Works</a></b><br>Refers to the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which serve as evidence of His divine authority and unity with the Father.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a city central to Jewish religious life and a place where Jesus often taught and performed miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_works_as_evidence.htm">The Importance of Works as Evidence</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that His works are a testament to His divine nature.

Failing the intuitive faith-knowledge, He appeals to the intellectual perception, which is not immediate, but from which they may ascend to that knowledge, and may then really know that such works can be only of the Father; and that, therefore, the Father is present in Him who does them, and that He who does them is one with the Father <a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if I do</span> - if I am performing the works of my Father, if these acts of healing and helping, of mighty consolation and symbolic grace, are obviously such as you can recognize as the Father's, believe them; learn that much, - it is for your life - and if you make that acquisition, <span class="cmt_word">though ye believe not me</span> - though you do not credit my assertion on my own authority, though you do not take me at once on my own word - <span class="cmt_word">believe the works; you may</span> then take the further step, and both <span class="cmt_word">know and understand</span>, or know broadly and completely, and then learn in details, <span class="cmt_word">that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</span> Between the assertion of ver. 30, "I and my Father are one," and that of this verse, "the works" are introduced - works that are recognized as Divine, "the Father's," but seen and known also to be Christ's own works. Why should they stone him for blasphemy if they have evidence so resistless as this, even if it comes short of proof, that he is absolutely one with the Father? The intuitive perception of the Divine in Christ is the highest and noblest spiritual experience. His word should be, might be, enough; but, suppose it should fail, miracles, "works," come in to link the Divine Personality of the Speaker with the supreme Father. The works may teach them that he is in the Father, and the Father in him. Not by a flash of light, but by growing intellectual conviction, they must come to a conclusion which the great assertion," I and the Father are one," finally confirms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
