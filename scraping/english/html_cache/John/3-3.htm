Seeing the kingdom implies understanding and experiencing God's rule, which is a spiritual insight granted to believers.<p><b>unless he is born again</b><br>The term "born again" (Greek: "an&#333;then") can also mean "born from above," indicating a spiritual rebirth. This concept is pivotal in Christian theology, signifying a transformation that occurs through the Holy Spirit. It connects to Old Testament themes of renewal and cleansing, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit.

Jesus at once answers these questions; the answer being, as it frequently is, to the unexpressed thought (comp. <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/john/2-18.htm" title="Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?">John 2:18</a>). The coming of the Messiah, the Divine Glory, God's Kingdom, these are the thoughts which filled men's minds. These miracles--in what relation did they stand to it? This Teacher--what message from God had He about it?<p><span class= "bld">Verily, verily, I say unto thee.</span>--(Comp. <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) The words are in the decisive tone of authority and certainty. "This is God's teaching for thee, teacher as thou thyself art" (<a href="/john/3-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?">John 3:10</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</span>--Our translators have followed the ancient expositors in giving the alternative renderings "born again" and "born from above" (margin). Chrysostom notes the two currents of interpretation in his day; and in our own day the opinions of scholars, whether we count them or weigh them, may be equally claimed for either view. There can be no doubt that the Greek word (<span class= "greekheb">??????</span>) is found with both meanings. It is equally certain that St. John elsewhere uses it in the local sense "from above" only (<a href="/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>; <a href="/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>; <a href="/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>); but these instances are not sufficient to establish an <span class= "ital">usus loquendi,</span> and the sense here, and in <a href="/john/3-7.htm" title="Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.">John 3:7</a>, must be taken in connection with the meaning of the verb. (Comp. the same word in <a href="/luke/1-3.htm" title="It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,">Luke 1:3</a>, "from the very first," and <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>, "again.") What has not, perhaps, been sufficiently noted is, that the Greek word is not the true key to the difficulty, and that its double sense has led men to seek the meaning in a wrong direction. The dialogue was between One who was called and one who really was a Rabbi. The word actually used almost certainly conveyed but one sense, and it is this sense which the Syriac version, coming to us from the second century, and closely connected with the Palestinian dialect of the first century, has preserved. This version reads "from the beginning," "afresh," "anew." This is the sense which St. John wishes to express for his Greek readers, and the word used by him exactly does express it. That the Greek word has another meaning also, which expresses the same thought from another point of view, may have determined its choice. This other point of view was certainly not absent from the circle of the writer's thoughts (comp. <a href="/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-21.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> <span class="accented">The revelation of earthly</span> and <span class="accented">heavenly things to one who knew that God was with him.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-12.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The conditions of admission into the kingdom of God. New birth of the Spirit.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Many explanations have been offered of the link of connection between the suggestion of Nicodemus and the reply of Jesus. Many expansions or additions have been conjectured, such as the following, suggested by Christ's own language elsewhere: "You, by the finger of God, are casting out devils; then the kingdom of God has come nigh unto us. How may we enter upon its further proofs?" - a view which would demand a deeper knowledge of the mind of Christ than we have any reason to suppose diffused at this period. Others (Baumlein) have supposed Nicodemus to have said, "Does the baptism of John suffice for admission into the kingdom?" - a suggestion which would be most strange for a Pharisaic Sanhedrist to have extemporized. At the same time, it may be proved that the rabbis regarded proselytism as a "new birth," and one produced or brought about by circumcision and baptism (Wunsche, <span class="accented">l.c.</span> 506; Geikie, 1:505). Others, again, have put further words into the reply of Jesus, such as, "The kingdom of God is not in the miracles which I am working; it is in a state of things which can only be appreciated by a radical spiritual change" (Lucke). Similarly Luthardt. Nicodemus was thinking of the kingdom of God evinced by miraculous signs; and Jesus points him to the inner reality rather than to the outer manifestation. Godet sees the Pharisaic position in the question of Nicodemus, "Art thou the Messiah? is the kingdom of God near, as thy miracles seem to indicate?" He was assuming that, as a Pharisee, he had nothing to do but walk in the light, the dawn of which was revealed to him in the signs of a divinely sent Teacher. All these views embrace a large amount of possible conjectural truth; but they ignore the play upon the words of Nicodemus, which the answer of Jesus involves, showing that a sharp, clean retort followed the speech of the former. "<span class="accented">We know that</span> NO MAN IS ABLE <span class="accented">to do these signs which thou art working</span> EXCEPT GOD, BE WITH HIM. <span class="accented">Verily, verily, I say unto thee</span>, EXCEPT ONE <span class="accented">be born anew</span>, HE IS NOT ABLE <span class="accented">to see the kingdom of God."</span> The form of both protasis and apodosis in each sentence closely corresponds, and this correspondence suggests the fact of an immediate repartee. adopting even the form of the question or assertion of the ruler of the Jews. To the "we know" of Nicodemus, comes the "I say unto thee" of Jesus. To the general sentiment of Nicodemus Christ gives a personal application. In place of speculation concerning his own relation to God and to the kingdom, Christ searches in the heart of his questioner for spiritual susceptibility. Over against the general proposition about God being with the Worker of these signs Christ sets the practical truth and Divine possibility of any man seeing the kingdom of God. To the suspicion of Jesus being the Messenger and Minister of God, he opposes the supposition of being born from heaven, or anew. From ancient times commentators have been divided as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> - whether it should be rendered "from above" or "anew," "<span class="accented">again."</span> The first was favoured by Origen and many others down to Bengel, Lucke, Meyer, Baur, Wordsworth, Lange, based on the local meaning of the word in numerous places; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "from the top" (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), "from heaven above" (<a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15, 17</a>; <a href="/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>; <a href="/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>). Moreover, John uses the idea of birth <span class="accented">from God</span>, or by <span class="accented">his will</span> supervening on the life of man, and the consequent conference upon it of a new beginning (<a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1, 4, 18</a>). The great point on which our Lord insists is the Divine spiritual origin of the life of which he has so much to say. Several of the English versions, Coverdale's - and second edition of the Bishops' Bible - have adopted this rendering, with the Armenian and Gothic Versions. The Revised Version has placed it in the margin. Against it is to be brought the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 23</a>, and in Justin, 'Apol.,' 1:6l) - a word which corresponds with this clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and yet could scarcely be translated "to be born from above," but, "to be born again." The second rendering, giving a temporal value to <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, was adopted by Augustine, Chrysostom (who uses both views), the Vulgate, Luther, Calvin, Tholuck, Godet, Westcott, Moulton, Weiss, and Luthardt, and is sustained by the fact that Nicodemus was led by it to an inquiry about (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) a second birth. If the expression had had no ambiguity about it, and merely conveyed the idea of a heavenly birth, his mistake would have been greater than it was. There are, moreover, numerous passages confirming the temporal sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (Wettstein and Grimm both quote from Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:18. 3; and Artemidorus, 'Oneiroc.,' 1:13); and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a> points in the same direction. The Jewish rabbi ought to have been familiar with the idea of the "new heart" and "right spirit," and the marvellous and mighty change wrought in men by the Holy Spirit; but the spiritual idea had been overlaid by rabbinic ritualism, and all the hopeless entanglements of ceremonial purity which had been reacts to do duty for spiritual conformity with the Divine will. Archdeacon Watkins reminds us that the Syriac Version here gives the rendering "from the beginning," or "anew," and lays great stress on this solution of the ambiguity in the Greek word. The statement of Christ is very remarkable. A man must be born anew, must undergo a radical change, even to <span class="accented">see the kingdom of God</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). The true kingdom is not a Divine government of outward, visible magnificence, sustained by miraculous aid - a physical sovereignty which shall rival and eclipse the majesty of Caesar. When the kingdom shall come in its genuine power, the carnal eye will not discover its presence. The man born anew will alone be able to appreciate it. The Jews boasted that they were born of God (<a href="/john/8-41.htm">John 8:41</a>), but could not understand that they needed vital, fundamental, moral renewal - a second birth, a new beginning. Let the opening of Christ's Galilaean ministry be compared with this bold utterance. There in public discourse he called upon all men everywhere to "repent," to undergo a radical change of mind, and that because the kingdom of heaven was at hand. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> portrays the same change as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; but one term denotes thai; change as a human experience and effort, the other as a Divine operation. Neither repentance nor regeneration commended itself to the rabbinic mind as a necessity for one who was exalted by privilege and ennobled by obedience. The phrase, "kingdom of God," is not a mode of representing truth to which this Gospel calls frequent attention. Still our Lord to Pilate (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>) admits that he is himself the Head of kingdom which is "not from hence" - not resting on this world as its foundation or source. In Matthew the whole of the mission of Christ among men is repeatedly portrayed as "the kingdom of heaven." And from the time when the Lord ascended until now, various efforts have been made to realize, to discover, to embody, to emblazon, to crush, to ignore, that kingdom and its King. This great utterance is a key to much of the history of the Church, and an explanation of its numberless mistakes. Moreover, it supplies an invaluable hint of the true nature of the kingdom of God. Thoma insists on the other rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, and compares it with the Philonic doctrine, "that the substance of the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> is not attributed to that which is created, but is breathed into the flesh from above (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) by God.... Aim, O soul, at the bodiless essence of the spirit world as thy inheritance." These ideas, he thinks, John has placed into the lips of Jesus. The two classes of ideas are fundamentally distinct. Philo contrasts the sensuous and the intellectual; Christ is contrasting nature and grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(soi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
