The "word" refers to the teachings and truths that Jesus imparted, which are rooted in the Old Testament scriptures and fulfilled in His life and ministry. This act of giving the word is a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise up a prophet like Moses. Jesus, as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodies the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<p><b>and the world has hated them.</b><br>The "world" in this context refers to the system of values and beliefs that are opposed to God, often characterized by sin and rebellion. The hatred from the world is a direct consequence of the disciples' alignment with Jesus and His teachings. This animosity fulfills Jesus' earlier warnings in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>, where He explains that the world will hate His followers because it first hated Him. Historically, this hatred manifested in the persecution of early Christians, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of Paul.<p><b>For they are not of the world,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the distinct identity of Jesus' followers. Being "not of the world" signifies a spiritual transformation and a new allegiance to God's kingdom. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are described as a chosen people, set apart from the world. The disciples' values, priorities, and ultimate hope are rooted in their relationship with Christ, distinguishing them from worldly pursuits.<p><b>just as I am not of the world.</b><br>Jesus' own separation from the world underscores His divine origin and mission. He operates on a different plane, one that is aligned with the will of the Father. This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of His kingdom, which is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). Jesus' life and ministry serve as a model for His followers, who are called to live in the world but not be conformed to it, as Paul instructs in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. This phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where believers are united with Christ in His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is praying to the Father on behalf of His disciples.
