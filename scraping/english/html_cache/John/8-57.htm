The Jews here likely refer to the Pharisees or other religious authorities who were often in opposition to Jesus' teachings. This interaction takes place in Jerusalem, a central location for Jewish religious life, particularly in the temple courts where Jesus often taught. The Jewish leaders were known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions, and they frequently challenged Jesus' claims and authority.<p><b>&#8220;You are not yet fifty years old</b><br>The mention of "fifty years old" is significant as it reflects the cultural understanding of age and maturity. In Jewish tradition, fifty years was considered an age of maturity and wisdom, often associated with the ability to teach and lead. The statement underscores their skepticism about Jesus' claim to have seen Abraham, as He was visibly much younger than fifty. This age reference also highlights the incredulity of the Jews regarding Jesus' pre-existence and divine nature.<p><b>and You have seen Abraham?&#8221;</b><br>This question is rooted in the Jewish understanding of their patriarchal heritage. Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, lived approximately 2,000 years before Jesus. The Jews revered Abraham as a foundational figure in their faith, and the idea that Jesus, a contemporary figure, could have seen Abraham was beyond their comprehension. This question challenges Jesus' earlier statement in <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>, where He claims that Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing His day. The Jews' question reflects their misunderstanding of Jesus' divine nature and eternal existence, which is further clarified in the subsequent verse where Jesus declares, "Before Abraham was born, I am!" This declaration connects to the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, affirming Jesus' identity as the eternal God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>In this context, "the Jews" refers to the religious leaders and people who were questioning Jesus.

Others, and among them were the "Elders who in Asia conferred with John, the Lord's disciple," have held that our Lord was between forty and fifty years of age at the time of his public ministry. We know this from the testimony of Irenaeus, who appears to have this very passage in his mind, for he says, <span class= "ital">"</span>As the gospel and all the Elders witness" (Lib. 2 chap. 22 ? 5; Oxford Translation, p. 160). But "fifty years" was the period of full manhood (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/4-39.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:39</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>). This is expressed in round numbers, and there is no care to be more exact in comparison with the two thousand years which had passed since the close of Abraham's earthly life. The thought is, "Thou art still a young man, and hast thou seen Abraham who died twenty centuries ago?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews, therefore, said unto him</span> - once more misinterpreting his words, and giving a materialistic tone to his Divine hint - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast not yet fifty years</span> - "Thou art not fifty years old" - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> Christ did not <span class="accented">say</span> that be had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen and rejoiced in his day. The Jews chose to regard the language of Jesus as adding another immense improbability, if not falsehood, to his previous claims, viz. that he had actually lived to twice the age of Methuselah already. The "fifty years old" may have been simply used in round numbers for the age of man's prime and completed life (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 39</a>; <a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>). There may have been, even if our Lord was only thirty-three years of age at the time of his Passion, that which <span class="accented">apparently</span> added to his years. A tradition is mentioned (Irenaeus, 100, 2, 22. 5) of the more advanced age of Jesus which the Ephesian presbyters preserved, and which Irenaeus regards as between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years. Ernest de Bunsen vainly finds a reference to Christ's age (<a href="/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>) in the forty-six years of the temple; but it is strange that, with the exception of the statement in <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>, there is nothing in the extraneous chronological data, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the death of Herod and recall of Pontius Pilate, which need positively compress our Lord's life within fifty years (Westcott). And Keim has made the suggestion that our Lord did carry on his ministry for a much longer period than is commonly supposed. It is far more probable, however, that the Jews were using an expression for the term of a completed life, and were supplying no chronological data whatever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-57.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
