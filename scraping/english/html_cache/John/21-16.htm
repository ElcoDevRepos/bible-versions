The use of "Simon son of John" rather than "Peter" may indicate a return to his original identity, highlighting the gravity of the moment. The question of love is central, as love for Christ is foundational for discipleship and leadership within the Church. The Greek word for love here is "agapao," indicating a deep, selfless love.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, Lord,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;You know I love You.&#8221;</b><br>Peter's response uses the Greek word "phileo," which denotes a brotherly or affectionate love, suggesting a more personal and emotional connection. This distinction in Greek terms for love may reflect Peter's humility and awareness of his previous failures. His affirmation acknowledges Jesus' omniscience, as Jesus knows the hearts of all men (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<p><b>Jesus told him, &#8220;Shepherd My sheep.&#8221;</b><br>This command signifies Peter's reinstatement and commissioning as a leader in the early Church. The metaphor of shepherding is rich in biblical tradition, with leaders often depicted as shepherds (Psalm 23, <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>). Jesus, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), entrusts Peter with the care of His followers, indicating a role of guidance, protection, and nurturing. This charge aligns with the pastoral responsibilities outlined in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>, where Peter later exhorts elders to shepherd God's flock willingly and eagerly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The resurrected Christ, who is reaffirming Peter's role among the disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, who had previously denied Jesus three times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_tiberias.htm">The Sea of Tiberias</a></b><br>The location where Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who were present during this post-resurrection appearance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep.htm">The Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolically representing the followers of Christ, whom Peter is instructed to shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_forgiveness.htm">Restoration and Forgiveness</a></b><br>Jesus' questioning of Peter is a process of restoration, emphasizing that past failures do not disqualify us from future service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_the_foundation_of_ministry.htm">Love as the Foundation of Ministry</a></b><br>The repeated question "Do you love Me?" highlights that genuine love for Christ is the essential motivation for serving others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_a_shepherd.htm">The Role of a Shepherd</a></b><br>Peter is called to "shepherd My sheep," indicating the responsibility of spiritual leaders to care for and guide the community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Jesus' command to Peter underscores the importance of obedience in fulfilling one's calling.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_personal_nature_of_discipleship.htm">The Personal Nature of Discipleship</a></b><br>Jesus addresses Peter personally, reminding us that our relationship with Christ is individual and intimate.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_21_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 21:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_21_16_apply_today.htm">How does John 21:16 demonstrate Jesus' call to "tend My sheep" today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_21_16_show_Peter_s_renewal.htm">What does Jesus' repetition in John 21:16 reveal about Peter's restoration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_by_tend_My_sheep.htm">How can we apply the command to "tend My sheep" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_21_16_link_to_love_service_teachings.htm">How does John 21:16 connect with Jesus' teachings on love and service?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Tend_My_sheep_church_leadership_lesson.htm">What does "tend My sheep" teach about leadership responsibilities in the church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_ask_Peter_thrice_about_love.htm">Why does Jesus ask Peter if he loves Him three times in John 21:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_tell_Peter_to_shepherd.htm">What is the significance of Jesus instructing Peter to "Shepherd My sheep" in John 21:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_21_16_Peter_s_restoration_post-denial.htm">How does John 21:16 reflect the restoration of Peter after his denial of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_the_apostles_die.htm">What were the causes of the apostles' deaths?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_did_peter_learn_jesus_is_the_christ.htm">How did Simon Peter find out that Jesus was the Christ?

Asking again begins a one-for-one renewal of those failures.<p>- Scripture often uses repetition for emphasis&#8212;see <a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a> and <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>&#8212;so the doubled question underscores the seriousness of Peter&#8217;s future calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Simon son of John, do you love Me?</b><p>- Jesus uses Peter&#8217;s birth name, grounding the moment in personal reality (cf. <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>).<p>- The focus is love, not skill or past record. Jesus links leadership to wholehearted affection for Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p>- Love for Christ becomes the true credential for ministry; without it, even great ability is empty (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yes, Lord</b><p>- Peter&#8217;s answer is immediate and sincere. Having seen the risen Christ (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-20</a>), he now responds out of humbled confidence.<p>- Calling Jesus &#8220;Lord&#8221; reflects submission and recognition of His authority (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>).<p>- This moment shows how repentance leads to renewed allegiance (<a href="/psalms/51-12.htm">Psalm 51:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You know I love You</b><p>- Peter appeals to Jesus&#8217; omniscience (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>). He is no longer boasting in himself; he rests on what the Lord already sees (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>- The statement carries both confession and dependence: &#8220;I love You&#8212;and You must confirm it because You know all things.&#8221;<p>- Genuine love is lived out openly before God (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>) and serves as the foundation for faithful service (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shepherd My sheep</b><p>- Jesus moves immediately from affection to action.

Peter later echoes this charge: &#8220;Shepherd the flock of God that is among you&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>).<p>- The sheep belong to Jesus (&#8220;My sheep,&#8221; cf. <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27-29</a>). Any authority Peter exercises is delegated and accountable (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a> shows Jesus patiently restoring Peter, linking love for Christ with the call to care for His people. Repeating the question presses Peter past his earlier denials, while the command &#8220;Shepherd My sheep&#8221; turns restored affection into concrete service. True discipleship moves from heartfelt devotion to active, faithful ministry under the Chief Shepherd&#8217;s authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">He saith to him again the second time.</span>--The question is repeated in exactly the same form, except that our Lord does not continue the comparison "more than these."

Here our Lord omits, as Peter had done, the "more than these," but he again, with perhaps deeper meaning, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>. Dost thou render me even more in one sense, though less in another, of thy heart's reverence? Dost thou treat me with the confidence and esteem, submission and admiration, which are my due? Again Peter, with his heart bursting with personal affection, feels that he can and must say, <span class="cmt_word">Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> ere; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love thee dearly). The commission that follows is the second stage of pastoral office. <span class="cmt_word">He saith to him, Tend</span> ("act the part of shepherd") <span class="cmt_word">my sheep</span>. Christ is the "good Shepherd," and, as Peter puts it in <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>, the "chief Shepherd." He has laid down his life with a view of taking it again, and ever after discharging the functions of the Shepherd. He means to bring all the "sheep" into one flock. They shall all hear his voice, and receive from him everlasting life. Meanwhile the leader of the apostles is made to appreciate that love is the condition of all healthy guidance. Faculty for rule is part of the very nature of the pastoral care. The sheep will need this even more than the "lambs;" the old disciples will require, even more than the young converts, both direction and command In this respect the subsequent career of Peter was more conspicuous than that of the rest of the apostles (see <a href="/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>; <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a> for the use of the word). But the shepherding of the sheep is an essentially necessary and integral portion of every pastor's care. When assailed by the wolf of heresy, by the hostile marauder, by new conditions of any kind, by special danger, unless he can in self-forgetting love pilot and protect his flock, he is no true shepherd. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] asked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a second time,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(deuteron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1208.htm">Strong's 1208: </a> </span><span class="str2">Second; with the article: in the second place, for the second time.
