The use of both "believe" and "know" indicates a faith that is both intellectual and experiential. In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, many disciples were turning away from Jesus after His teaching on being the Bread of Life. However, Peter, speaking for the Twelve, affirms their steadfast faith. This dual affirmation of belief and knowledge is reminiscent of the call to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). It underscores the importance of a faith that is not blind but informed and assured.<p><b>that You are</b><br>The phrase "You are" is a direct acknowledgment of Jesus' identity. In the Gospel of John, Jesus makes several "I am" statements (e.g., <a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, "Before Abraham was born, I am"), which echo God's self-revelation to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. This acknowledgment by the disciples is a recognition of Jesus' divine nature and authority. It is a confession that aligns with the purpose of John's Gospel, which is to demonstrate that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p><b>the Holy One of God.</b><br>This title, "the Holy One of God," is significant in its Old Testament roots and its Christological implications. In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is often used to describe God Himself (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>). By using this title, the disciples are recognizing Jesus as set apart and consecrated by God, sharing in His divine holiness. This confession also connects to other New Testament affirmations of Jesus' divine nature, such as Peter's declaration in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." The title emphasizes Jesus' unique role in God's redemptive plan, fulfilling prophecies and typologies of the Messiah who would come to save His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, identified as the "Holy One of God."

I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>), and it has been, perhaps, suggested by the present discourse (<a href="/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>; <a href="/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>). Like the title Messiah, or Christ, it marks out the consecration to His work. (Comp. <a href="/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1John 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>.) The true reading brings out the successive confessions, which are certainly twice, and probably three times, spoken by Peter. This is the second, coming between that of <a href="/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a> and that of <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm" title="And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.">Matthew 16:16</a>.
