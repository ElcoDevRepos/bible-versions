In the context of first-century Judea, many were anticipating the arrival of the Messiah, and some even speculated that John might be the one. However, John consistently denied being the Christ (<a href="/john/1-20.htm">John 1:20</a>). This distinction is crucial in understanding the humility and purpose of John&#8217;s ministry. Theologically, it underscores the uniqueness of Jesus as the true Light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The imagery of light is significant throughout Scripture, symbolizing truth, purity, and divine revelation (<a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p><b>but he came to testify about the Light</b><br>John&#8217;s mission was to bear witness to Jesus, preparing the way for His ministry (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). The concept of testimony is central in the Gospel of John, where the legal and relational aspects of bearing witness are highlighted. In a cultural context, testimony was a critical component of establishing truth, especially in Jewish legal proceedings (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). John&#8217;s testimony was not just verbal but also through his lifestyle and baptism, calling people to repentance and pointing them to Christ (<a href="/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3:1-3</a>). This role as a witness is a model for believers, who are also called to testify to the truth of Christ in their lives (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A pivotal figure in the New Testament, John the Baptist was a prophet who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.

Believers today follow his pattern: humbly acknowledge we are not the Light, confidently step into our God-given assignments, and boldly bear witness to Jesus so that others may believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He was not that Light, but was sent.</span>--It is necessary to repeat the statement of John's position and work in an emphatic form. Now first for 400 years a great teacher had appeared in Israel. The events of his birth and life had excited the attention of the masses; his bold message, like the cry of another Elias, found its way in burning words to the slumbering hearts of men; and even from the least likely classes, from Pharisee and Sadducee, from publican and soldier, there came the heart's question, "What shall we do?" The extent of the religious revival does not impress us, because it passed into the greater which followed, but the statement of a publican living at the time is that "Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, went out to Him, and were baptized of Him in Jordan, confessing their sins" (<a href="/context/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5-6</a>). But what was this power in their midst? Who could be the person uttering these more than human words? A comparison of <a href="/context/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19-20</a> in this chapter with <a href="/luke/3-15.htm" title="And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;">Luke 3:15</a> shows a widespread opinion that he was at least possibly the Messiah. He himself with true greatness recognised the greater, but as in many a like case in after days, the followers had not all the leader's nobility of soul. We shall meet signs of this in <a href="/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a>; <a href="/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>. We find traces of it in <a href="/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>, &c. (see Note at this place), and even in Ephesus, as late as St. Paul's third missionary journey, we find "certain disciples" knowing nothing more than "John's baptism" (<a href="/context/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1-6</a>). It was at Ephesus that this Gospel was written and the existence of a body of such "disciples" may have led to the full statement in this verse made by one who had himself been among the Baptist's earliest followers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - A solemn warning is given, which forever discriminates the ministry of man from the eternal ministry of the Logos. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> (John, and with him all the prophetic, Levitical, ascetic teachers in all ages) <span class="cmt_word">was not the Light, but</span> [<span class="accented">he was</span> or <span class="accented">came</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he might bear witness of the Light.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> depends upon some unexpressed verbal thought; for even in the passages where it stands alone (<a href="/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>; <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>; <a href="/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>; <a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>) the reference is not obscure to some pre-existing or involved verb. The distinction here drawn between John and the Light is thought by some expositors to point to the condition of the Ephesian Church, in the neighbourhood of which there still lingered some who placed John in even a higher position than that accorded to Jesus (<a href="/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3, 4</a>); but the teaching of the evangelist is far more comprehensive than this. <span class="accented">The Light</span> of men has higher source and wider range of operation than that of any prophetic man. All that he, that any seer whatsoever can do, is to bear witness to it. The prophets, from Moses to John, derived all their power, their sanction, and the corroboration of their message, from the Logos light shining through conscience and blazing through providential events and burning up the stubble of human action with unquenchable fire. The prophets are not the light of God; they are sent to bear witness to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He himself</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ekeinos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1565.htm">Strong's 1565: </a> </span><span class="str2">That, that one there, yonder.
