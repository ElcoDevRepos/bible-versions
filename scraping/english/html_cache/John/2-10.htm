In the cultural context of a Jewish wedding, the master of the banquet was responsible for overseeing the feast and ensuring everything was in order. His role was significant, as weddings were major social events in Jewish society.<p><b>&#8220;Everyone serves the fine wine first,</b><br>In ancient Jewish culture, wine was a staple at celebrations, and it was customary to serve the best wine at the beginning of the event. This practice ensured that guests would appreciate the quality of the wine while their senses were still sharp. The mention of "fine wine" underscores the expectation of providing the best at the outset, reflecting the host's honor and hospitality.<p><b>and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk.</b><br>The phrase highlights a common practice of serving inferior wine once the guests' senses were dulled. This reflects a pragmatic approach to hospitality, where the quality of the wine could be reduced without the guests noticing. The cultural context here emphasizes the importance of maintaining appearances and managing resources wisely during extended celebrations.<p><b>But you have saved the fine wine until now!&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the miraculous nature of Jesus' first public miracle, turning water into wine. The unexpected reversal of the usual order signifies the abundance and superiority of what Jesus provides. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the new covenant, where Jesus offers something far superior to the old. It also foreshadows the eschatological promise of the Messianic banquet, where the best is yet to come. This miracle, occurring at the beginning of Jesus' ministry, sets the stage for His identity as the Messiah who brings transformation and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs His first recorded miracle at the wedding in Cana.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_at_cana.htm">The Wedding at Cana</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus turns water into wine, marking the beginning of His public ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master_of_the_banquet.htm">The Master of the Banquet</a></b><br>The individual responsible for overseeing the wedding feast, who comments on the quality of the wine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Those who follow Jesus' instructions to fill the jars with water, witnessing the miracle firsthand.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present at the wedding and begin to believe in Him through this miracle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_abundance_of_god's_provision.htm">The Abundance of God's Provision</a></b><br>God's provision is not only sufficient but abundant and of the highest quality.

Our translators have shrunk from that rendering here, though it was before them in the "When men be dronke," of Tyndall and Cranmer. The physical meaning of the word is to saturate with moisture, as we say, to be <span class= "ital">drenched,</span> which is the same word as <span class= "ital">drunk.</span> There is clearly no reference to the present feast. It is a coarse jest of the ruler's, the sort of remark that forms part of the stock in trade of a hired manager of banquets. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And saith, Every man at the first setteth on the good wine, and when men have drunk deeply, then that which is worse</span> (literally, <span class="accented">smaller</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thou hast kept</span> (<span class="accented">guarded</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the good wine until now.</span> The classical passages supposed to illustrate this jovial saying throw little light upon it. The meaning is obvious enough, and there is no need to search in ancient wit for the original of a speech which is not too recondite to have been originated on this occasion. The best wine is appropriately given when the seneca are keenest, but when the climax of the festival has come, when they have drunk too deeply, or are intoxicated, then the weaker, poorer, and less fragrant wine is acceptable. There need be no reference whatever to the present company.

The whole saying simply asserts, by an outsider, the concrete reality of a wonderful change that had occurred. He knew nothing of a miracle. He merely guaranteed unwittingly the phenomena that came within the range of his senses. This becomes more impressive because he knew nothing of the cause, and was profoundly ignorant of the claims of his strange and wonderful Guest. No further remark is offered. We are not told how the fact was referred to the will or authority of Jesus, to the kindness or generosity of the mother; or whether the company generally learned the mysterious powers of their fellow Guest. The bridegroom thus honoured made no reply that is recorded; and, by emphatic silence, the impression is conveyed that this manifestation of the power of the Lord was not, in his opinion, the coming of his "hour." Strange reticence is observed, but this is added - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
