Despite being relatives (<a href="/luke/1-36.htm">Luke 1:36</a>), John did not recognize Jesus' divine identity until it was revealed to him. This highlights the divine nature of Jesus' mission and the necessity of spiritual revelation. It underscores the theme of divine revelation, as seen in <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, where Peter's recognition of Jesus as the Christ is attributed to divine revelation rather than human insight.<p><b>but the reason I came baptizing with water</b><br>John's baptism was a baptism of repentance, preparing the way for the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>). Baptism with water symbolized purification and readiness for the coming Messiah. This act was not just a ritual but a prophetic action, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and setting the stage for the new covenant.

John's testimony and baptism served as a divine introduction of Jesus to the nation, marking the beginning of His public ministry.

Thus John&#8217;s entire mission served one grand purpose: to reveal the promised Christ to Israel, inaugurating the public phase of the Savior&#8217;s redemptive work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">And I knew him not.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and I also knew Him not;</span> so again in <a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>. The reference is to "whom ye know not" of <a href="/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a>, and the assertion is not, therefore, inconsistent with the fact that John did know Him on His approach to baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm" title="Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him.">Matthew 3:13</a>, see Note). In the sense that they did not know Him standing among them, he did not know Him, though with the incidents of His birth and earlier years and even features he must have been familiar. It cannot be that the Son of Mary was unknown to the son of Elizabeth, though One had dwelt in Nazareth and the other "was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel" (<a href="/luke/1-80.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.">Luke 1:80</a>; <a href="/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>). He knew not all, but there must have been many wondering thoughts of that wondrous life. Could it be the life that all looked for? but no; there was little of the Jewish idea of the Messiah in the carpenter of a country village (comp. <a href="/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.">Mark 6:3</a>). What he did know was, that his own work as herald declared "that He should be made manifest to Israel," and in that conviction he proclaimed the coming King, and began the Messianic baptism. The Person would be His own witness. Heaven would give its own sign to those who could spiritually read it. The Baptiser with the Spirit would Himself be so fully baptised with the Spirit coming upon and dwelling in Him, that to the spiritual eye it would take visual form and be seen "as a dove descending from heaven." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The <span class="accented">purpose of John's</span> <span class="accented">own mission was to introduce to Israel the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I for my part knew him not.</span> This is thought by some to be incompatible with the statement of <a href="/matthew/3-14.htm">Matthew 3:14</a>, where the Baptist displayed sufficient knowledge of Jesus to have exclaimed, "I have need to be baptized of thee." Early commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ammonius, quoted in 'Catena Patrum,' suggested that John's long residence in the wilderness had prevented his knowing his kinsman; Chrysostom, 'Hom. 16. in Joannem,' urged that he was not familiar with his person; Epiphanius, 'Adv. Haer.,' 30, and Justin Martyr, 'Dial.,' 100, 88, refer to a long passage in the 'Gospel of the Ebionites,' which, notwithstanding numerous perversions, yet suggests a method of conciliation of the two narratives, that the sign of the opening heavens and the voice occasioned the consternation of John, and explains his deprecation of the act which he had already performed (see my 'John the Baptist,' pp. 313, 314; Nicholson, 'Gospel according to the Hebrews,' pp. 38-40). Neander has suggested the true explanation: "In contradistinction to that which John now saw in the Divine light, all his previous knowledge appeared to be a non-knowledge." John knew <span class="accented">of Jesus</span>, as his kinsman; he knew him as One mightier than himself - One whose coming, as compared with his own, was as the coming of the Lord. When Jesus approached him for baptism, John therefore knew quite enough to make him hesitate to baptize the Christ. He knew more than enough to induce him to say, "I have need to be baptized of thee." Godet imagines that, since baptism was preceded by confession, John found that the confession made by Jesus was of such a lofty, saintly, God-like type of repudiation of sin, as that John himself had never attained to. This representation fails from attributing to John the function of a sacerdotal confessor of later days, and is out of harmony altogether with the meaning and potency of our Lord's confession of the sin of the whole of that human nature which he had taken upon himself. The knowledge which John had of Jesus was as nothing to the blaze of light which burst upon him when he realized the idea that Jesus was the Son of God. The "I knew him not" of this verse was a subsequent reflection of the Baptist when the sublime humility, the dovelike sweetness, and the spiritual might of Jesus were revealed to him. A blind man who had received his sight during the hours of darkness might imagine, when he saw the reflected glory of the moon or morning star in the eye of dawn, that he knew the nature and had felt the glory of light; but amidst the splendours of sunrise or of noon he might justly say, "I knew it not" (compare the language of Paul, <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, and of this same evangelist, <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. See Archdeacon Farrar's 'Life of Christ,' vol. 1:117; my 'John the Baptist,' p. 315). <span class="cmt_word">But that he should be manifested to Israel, for this cause I came baptizing in</span> (with) <span class="cmt_word">water</span>. It was traditionally expected that Elijah should anoint Messiah. John perceives now the transitional nature of his own mission. His baptism retires into the background. He sees that its whole meaning was the introduction of Messiah, the manifestation of the Son of God to Israel. It may be said that the ministry of the wilderness, with the vast impression it produced, is represented by the synoptists as of more essential importance in itself. John's own judgment, however, here recorded, is the true key to the whole representation. The synoptic narrative shows very clearly that, as a matter of fact, the Johannine ministry culminated at the baptism of Jesus, and lost itself in the dawn of the great day which it inaugurated and heralded. The Fourth Gospel does but give the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of such an arrangement, and refer the origin of the idea to John himself. If John did not <span class="accented">intensify</span> the sense of sin which Messiah was to soothe and take away; if John did not, by baptism with water, excite a desire for an infinitely nobler and more precious baptism; if John did not prepare a way for One of vastly more moment to mankind and to the kingdom of God than himself, - his whole work was a failure.
