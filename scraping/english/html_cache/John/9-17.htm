The man who had been blind is central to this narrative, representing those who receive spiritual sight through Christ. His healing is a sign of Jesus' messianic mission, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened.<p><b>&#8220;What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed to the healed man reflects the Pharisees' attempt to gather evidence against Jesus. It highlights the tension between Jesus' miraculous works and the religious leaders' refusal to accept Him. The healing of the blind man is a direct challenge to their authority and understanding of the law. This question also emphasizes personal testimony, a powerful element in the spread of the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>.<p><b>&#8220;He is a prophet,&#8221; the man replied.</b><br>The man's response acknowledges Jesus' divine authority and aligns Him with the tradition of Old Testament prophets who performed miracles and spoke God's truth. This recognition is significant, as it places Jesus within the prophetic tradition, yet it also falls short of recognizing His full identity as the Son of God.

They who questioned him in <a href="/john/9-15.htm" title="Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.">John 9:15</a>, question him again now.

What sayest <span class= "ital">thou?</span> He ought to know better than any one, seeing that his eyes had been opened and this they admit, while the nature of his witness is uncertain; but immediately that is given they disbelieve the fact of the miracle, and soon reject with scorn him they question now (<a href="/john/9-34.htm" title="They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.">John 9:34</a>).<p>The English reader should observe the punctuation here, which rightly makes the question one. It is sometimes read as though it were, "What sayest thou of Him? that He hath opened thine eyes?" It is not, however, the fact which is here questioned, but the opinion of the man, based upon the fact, for the present assumed as true, which is called for.<p><span class= "bld">He is a prophet.</span>--The education of the man has been doing its work, and he is convinced that the power which has healed him is direct from God, and that the person who has exercised it is a messenger from God. His words are uttered in the brevity and calmness of clear conviction, and they are the direct negative to the statement of the Pharisees, "This man is not from God." (Comp <a href="/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>; <a href="/john/4-19.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.">John 4:19</a>; <a href="/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>.) It is important to note, that even in the language of the ordinary people, the word "prophet" did not mean simply a predictor of events in the future, but one who was as the representative of God. He was not only or chiefly a "fore-teller," but a "forth-teller," declaring God's truth, revealing His will and character, bearing the witness of divine works; but as the future is ever present to the divine counsels, prophecy, in the narrower sense, may be part of the work of the true prophet. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span>; i.e. the Pharisees, divided in opinion, though probably united in their interrogation. Those, on the one hand, who believed in the miracle, and held that it carried Divine approbation of the conduct of Jesus, and, on the other hand, those who were so satisfied of the moral fault involved in the transaction, that they held that the miracle itself, if not a piece of deception or collusion, might even indicate some demonic source, rather than a Divine one, <span class="cmt_word">say therefore unto the blind man again</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> points to the virtual repetition of inquiries already made (ver. 15) - <span class="cmt_word">What dost thou say concerning him, seeing that he opened thine eyes</span>? "What explanation hast thou to offer? What view dost thou entertain of the Man himself? Some of us think that his trifling with the sabbatic law puts out of court the idea of any Divine aid having enabled him to work this marvel. Other some, as you see, declare that the fact which has occurred is proof that Jesus must have had God's approval, and be sustained by Divine grace. But what dost thou, the healed man, say? What conclusion hast thou adopted? Seeing that he has opened thine eyes, what sayest <span class="accented">thou</span> of Jesus?" There is a bare chance that the man might give a vague answer, or one which would minimize the miracle. It is obvious that, while the Pharisees were contradicting each other and in danger of open collision, the faith of the blind man who had received his sight became stronger. The light was dawning on him. The answer, so far as it went, boldly took the side of Jesus, and perhaps its cue from the language of those who had said, "How can a bad man do such signs as these?" <span class="cmt_word">And he said, He is a Prophet</span> (cf. <a href="/john/4-19.htm">John 4:19</a>; <a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>). Prophets, as divinely sent men, are even more authoritative than learned rabbis. If Jesus has broken through some of these restrictions by which they have "placed a hedge about the Law," surely he had a prophetic right to do it. The healing marks a Divine commission, and the healed man owned and freely confessed to so much as this: "He is a Prophet." Maimonides (quoted by Dr. Farrar) shows that the idea was current that <span class="accented">a prophet</span> might, on his own <span class="accented">ipse dixit</span>, alter or relax even the sabbath law, and that then the people were at liberty to obey him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
