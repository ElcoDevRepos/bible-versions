The Law, or Torah, includes the first five books of the Old Testament. Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, who were experts in the Law, highlighting their own standards. This reference underscores the authority and continuity of the Old Testament in the New Testament narrative. It also points to the importance of the Law in establishing truth and justice within the community.<p><b>it is written</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jesus is quoting directly from the Scriptures, emphasizing the authority and permanence of God's Word. The use of "it is written" is a common rabbinic formula for citing Scripture, which Jesus uses to affirm the validity and reliability of the Law. This also demonstrates Jesus' respect for the Scriptures and His deep understanding of them, as He often used Scripture to teach and correct.<p><b>that the testimony of two men</b><br>The requirement for two witnesses is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which states that a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. This principle was crucial in legal proceedings to ensure fairness and prevent false accusations. In the context of <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, Jesus uses this principle to validate His own testimony and that of the Father, highlighting the divine witness to His mission and identity.<p><b>is valid</b><br>The validity of testimony is a legal concept that ensures justice and truth. In the Jewish legal system, the corroboration of two witnesses was necessary to confirm a claim or accusation. Jesus uses this legal standard to argue for the legitimacy of His claims about Himself, as He and the Father both testify to His identity and mission. This also points to the broader theme of Jesus fulfilling the Law and the Prophets, as He embodies the truth and justice that the Law seeks to uphold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and teaching about His divine authority and testimony.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

The verse underscores the reliability of Scripture, the fairness of God&#8217;s judicial standards, and the unity between Father and Son. Those who honor the Law must therefore honor the One it ultimately points to&#8212;Jesus Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">It is also written in your law.</span>--He now proceeds to show again that the technical requirement of the Law was satisfied by His witness. The term <span class= "ital">"your</span> law" is material, as addressed to those who were professed expounders of it and accused Him of being a transgressor of it. (Comp. the parallel reference to the Law in <a href="/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a>; <a href="/john/15-25.htm" title="But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.">John 15:25</a>.) To assert that Jesus placed Himself in a position of antagonism to the Mosaic law, is to forget the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>); and to assert that the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel differs in this respect from the character as portrayed by the earlier Evangelists, is to forget the teaching of the last verse of John 5, and, indeed, to miss the whole force of these very passages. He does not, indeed, say "our law," as it was for them what it could not be for Him; but He mentions it to show in each case that He fulfilled it.<p><span class= "bld">That the testimony of two men is true.</span>--See <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, and comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a> and <a href="/context/mark/14-55.htm" title="And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.">Mark 14:55-56</a>. The words are here quoted freely, and "two men" is substituted for "two or three witnesses," which we find in both the passages in Deuteronomy. This prepares the way for the full thought of the "witness," in the next verse. The requirement of the Law would be satisfied with the evidence of two men: He has the witness of two Persons, but each is divine. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Having laid down the principle on which he was justified in maintaining the truthfulness of the assumption which the Pharisees impugned, he proceeded to vindicate, for these Jewish legalists, its agreement with the very letter of the Law. He adopted here the identical ground which was taken by him when first of all he claimed this fellowship with the Father. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and in your Law it has been written,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that the witness of two men is true.</span> Many have said that here Jesus puts himself on one side as in hostility to the Law; Baur and some others plead, from the very phrase "your Law," that Jesus could not have used such an expression, and that John could not have recorded it; and Reuss urges that this expression agrees with the "standpoint of the gospel,which aims at lowering and degrading the old dispensation." Nothing could be less in harmony with the facts (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 2). Even Meyer says, "The words are anti-Judaic... though not antinomian." Surely our Lord was simply appealing to his bitter enemies to recognize the application of the principle found in their own Law, of which they were continually making a proud boast. He simply goes to common ground of argument, and is ready to show that even the letter of the Law sustains his claim for the sufficient reason that he is not alone, but the Father is manifestly with him. Just as he never said "our Father" when addressing his disciples, but either "my Father" or "your Father" (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), because God is not the Father of men in the full sense in which he was Father to the only begotten Son; so he could not say "our Law" or "Moses gave us the Law" without derogating from the unique relation he sustained to the Law (compare Paul's language, <a href="/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17, 21, 23</a>). The quotation from Deuteronomy is not verbally exact; it even carries the statement of Scripture to a broader generalization, and is so worded that it applies to the case in point, by carrying the position to a legitimate consequence - "the witness of two <span class="accented">men</span> is <span class="accented">true."</span> By using the word "men," Christ suggests the contrast between two men on one side and the God-Man and the Father on the other. Lightfoot ('Horae Hebraicae') quotes 'Rosh-Shanah,' 1:2, 3, "that two persons well known must testify to the supreme court that they had seen the new moon! If these were unknown persons, they must bring proof that they were credible witnesses." Upon these common principles of jurisprudence the Lord was willing, in purely Jewish fashion, to rest his claim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
