This distinction highlights the role of Jesus as the spiritual leader and teacher, focusing on His mission to preach and teach rather than perform rituals. It also emphasizes the delegation of responsibilities to His disciples, which is consistent with the practice of training and empowering followers to carry on His work. This delegation is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus prepares His disciples for their future roles in spreading the Gospel (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a precursor to the Great Commission, where the disciples are sent out to baptize all nations.<p><b>but His disciples</b><br>The involvement of the disciples in baptizing indicates their active participation in Jesus' ministry. This practice of baptism by the disciples aligns with the Jewish tradition of ritual purification, which was familiar to the people of that time. It also signifies the beginning of the disciples' transition from learners to leaders, as they take on responsibilities that will later define their apostolic mission. This act of baptizing by the disciples can be seen as a type of the future church, where believers are called to be active participants in the ministry of reconciliation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>). The disciples' role in baptism also foreshadows the establishment of the early church, where baptism becomes a central sacrament of initiation into the Christian faith (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38-41</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, the Son of God, who came to bring salvation to humanity.
