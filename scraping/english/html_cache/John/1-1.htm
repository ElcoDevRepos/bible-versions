It signifies the pre-existence of the Word, indicating that the Word was present before the creation of the world. This emphasizes the eternal nature of the Word, suggesting that the Word is not a created being but has always existed. The phrase sets the stage for understanding the divine nature of the Word, aligning with the Jewish understanding of God as eternal.<p><b>was the Word</b><br>The term "Word" (Logos in Greek) is rich in meaning. In Jewish thought, the Word of God is associated with creation, revelation, and salvation. In Greek philosophy, Logos refers to reason or the principle of order in the universe. By using this term, the text bridges Jewish and Greek understandings, presenting the Word as the divine agent of creation and revelation. The Word is not merely a spoken word but a person, as later verses reveal, who is active in the world.<p><b>and the Word was with God</b><br>This phrase indicates a distinct yet intimate relationship between the Word and God. The preposition "with" suggests a face-to-face relationship, implying both distinction and unity. This relationship is foundational for the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, where the Word (later identified as Jesus Christ) is distinct from the Father yet fully divine. The phrase underscores the personal nature of the Word, who is in communion with God.<p><b>and the Word was God</b><br>This declaration affirms the full divinity of the Word. It is a clear statement of the Word's divine nature, asserting that the Word is not a lesser deity or a created being but fully God. This is crucial for understanding the identity of Jesus Christ, who is later revealed as the Word made flesh. The phrase supports the Christian belief in the deity of Christ, aligning with other New Testament passages such as <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, which speak of the fullness of deity dwelling in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word.htm">The Word (Logos)</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the pre-existent divine expression of God.

These four brief phrases ground our understanding of creation, revelation, redemption, and worship, calling us to trust and adore the Lord Jesus, the eternal Word who is God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">In the beginning.</span>--The reference to the opening words of the Old Testament is obvious, and is the more striking when we remember that a Jew would constantly speak of and quote from the book of Genesis as <span class= "ital">Ber?shith</span> ("in the beginning"). It is quite in harmony with the Hebrew tone of this Gospel to do so, and it can hardly be that St. John wrote his <span class= "ital">Ber?shith</span> without having that of Moses present to his mind, and without being guided by its meaning. We have then, in the earlier words, a law of interpretation for the later, and this law excludes every such sense as "the Everlasting Father" or "the divine wisdom," which is before all things, though both these have been supported by here and there a name of weight; much more does this law, strengthened as it is by the whole context, exclude any such sense as "the commencement of Christ's work on earth," which owes its existence to the foregone conclusion of a theory, and is marked by the absence of any support of weight. Our law seems equally to exclude from <span class= "ital">these</span> words the idea of "anteriority to time," which is expressed, not in them, but in the substantive verb which immediately follows. The Mosaic conception of "beginning" is marked by the first creative act. St. John places himself at the same starting point of time, but before he speaks of any creation he asserts the pre-existence of the Creator. In this "beginning" there already "was" the Word. (See expressions of this thought in <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/8-23.htm" title="I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.">Proverbs 8:23</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Was the Word.</span>--See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: Doctrine of the Word.</span><p><span class= "bld">With God.</span>--These words express the co-existence, but at the same time the distinction of person. They imply relation with, intercourse with. (Comp. the "in the bosom of the Father" of <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, and "Let <span class= "ital">us</span> make man" of <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>.) "Throned face to face with God," "the gaze ever directed towards God," have been given as paraphrases, and the full sense cannot be expressed in fewer words. The "with" represents "motion towards." The Being whose existence is asserted in the "was" is regarded as distinct, but not alone, as ever going forth in communion with God. (Comp. the use of the same word "with" in <a href="/matthew/13-56.htm" title="And his sisters, are they not all with us?
