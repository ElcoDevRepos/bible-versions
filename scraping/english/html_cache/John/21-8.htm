The disciples' return to shore in a boat is significant, as boats were a primary means of transportation and livelihood for fishermen in the region. This setting on the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias, is a familiar one for the disciples, many of whom were fishermen by trade. The act of coming ashore symbolizes a transition from labor to fellowship, as they are about to encounter the risen Christ. This moment echoes earlier instances in the Gospels where Jesus calls His disciples from their boats, signifying a call to a new purpose.<p><b>They dragged in the net full of fish,</b><br>The net full of fish is a direct result of Jesus' instruction to cast the net on the right side of the boat, demonstrating His divine authority and knowledge. This miraculous catch is reminiscent of a similar event in <a href="/luke/5.htm">Luke 5:1-11</a>, where Jesus first calls Peter, James, and John to be "fishers of men." The abundance of fish symbolizes the future success of the disciples' mission to spread the Gospel. It also serves as a reminder of God's provision and the fruitfulness that comes from obedience to Christ.<p><b>for they were not far from land,</b><br>The proximity to land suggests that the disciples were close to their destination, both physically and spiritually. This detail highlights the accessibility of Jesus, who meets His followers where they are. The nearness to land also implies safety and security, contrasting with previous instances where the disciples faced storms at sea. This setting provides a peaceful backdrop for the forthcoming encounter with Jesus, underscoring His role as a provider and protector.<p><b>only about a hundred yards.</b><br>The specific mention of "a hundred yards" (approximately 90 meters) provides a tangible measure of distance, grounding the narrative in reality. This detail emphasizes the miraculous nature of the catch, as such a large number of fish was gathered so close to shore, where fish are typically less abundant. The precision of this measurement reflects the eyewitness nature of the account, lending credibility to the Gospel narrative. It also serves as a reminder of the disciples' human limitations and the divine intervention required to achieve their mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were fishing on the Sea of Galilee.
