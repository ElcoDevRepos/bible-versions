The disciples are being sent to gather the fruits of a spiritual harvest they did not initiate. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God often calls His people to participate in His work, even when they have not been the primary agents of that work. In the context of <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, Jesus is speaking to His disciples after His encounter with the Samaritan woman, indicating that the groundwork for the spiritual harvest in Samaria was laid by others, possibly including the prophets and John the Baptist, who prepared the way for the Messiah.<p><b>others have done the hard work,</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the labor of those who came before, such as the prophets, John the Baptist, and even Jesus Himself, who laid the foundation for the disciples' ministry. Historically, the Jewish people had been prepared for the coming of the Messiah through centuries of prophecy and teaching. The "hard work" can also be seen in the context of the Old Testament prophets who faced persecution and hardship to deliver God's message. This labor is not just physical but spiritual, involving prayer, teaching, and enduring opposition.<p><b>and now you have taken up their labor.</b><br>The disciples are entering into a ministry that has been prepared for them, emphasizing the continuity of God's work throughout history. This phrase suggests a transition of responsibility and the privilege of participating in God's redemptive plan. It also points to the communal and intergenerational nature of God's work, where one generation builds upon the efforts of the previous one. This is seen in the broader biblical narrative, where the apostles continue the mission of Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit, to spread the Gospel to all nations. The disciples' role is to continue the mission, reaping the harvest of souls for the Kingdom of God, a task that will be further empowered after Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Or the plural may be chosen as in contrast with the plural <span class= "ital">ye,</span> and as pointing to the general truth, while the immediate reference is to Christ only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - If this be the meaning, then, in the following verse, the whole conception of their relation to the past and dependence upon it is singled out for additional comment. <span class="cmt_word">I have sent you, and am now sending you, to reap that whereon ye have not toiled to weariness</span>. The idea of sowing (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is now expanded to (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">exhausting toil;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to all the laborious preparation of the soil for the seed, clearing of the forest, and ploughing on the rocky places, the cultivation of the jungle and fen. Much has been done by those who have gone before you. <span class="cmt_word">Others have toiled</span> thus; their footmarks are red with blood, their tears have watered the earth, <span class="cmt_word">and ye have entered</span> (<span class="accented">and are now entering</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into their toil.</span> There is no limitation here to the cycles of work and suffering, of disappointment and apparent failure which have preceded you. The "others" is surely not a pleonasm for himself, he does verily associate with himself all his forerunners. This <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is far more than the mere sowing of seed or diffusion of truth, and they who have during many centuries contributed of their life to the creation of the state of mind which makes these people susceptible to the truth, have prepared the way of the disciples. In a fit place, and in the fulness of the times, he came. The disciples of Jesus, moreover, have always had a greater or less degree of pioneer work to do. The efforts of the missionary Church may be represented at all times as toiling as well as sowing. Each generation of labourers in the great field of love to man enters upon work and toil which its precursors have originated. The Tubingen critics here, true to their theory of the origin of the Fourth Gospel in the second century, suppose that, by the "others," Jesus is supposed to <span class="accented">mean</span> Philip the evangelist, and, by the "reapers," Peter and John, who entered into his labours, in <a href="/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a>. Hilgenfeld thinks by the "others" was meant Paul, and by the "reapers" the twelve apostles, who sought to enter upon his work and appropriate its fruit. Thoma has followed vigorously along the same lines, and supposes that the Pauline thought <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-8</a>, and the story of the conversion of the Samaritans and of the heathen world to the Church, are here forthshadowed by the fourth evangelist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
