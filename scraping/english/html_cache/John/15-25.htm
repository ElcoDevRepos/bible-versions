It suggests that the actions and events are not random but are part of a divine plan. The concept of fulfillment is central to the New Testament, where many events in Jesus' life are seen as fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. This reflects the belief in the sovereignty of God and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through history.<p><b>what is written in their Law:</b><br>The term "their Law" refers to the Jewish Scriptures, particularly the Torah, which is the first five books of the Old Testament. However, in a broader sense, it can also refer to the entire Hebrew Bible. This phrase underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that Jesus' life and mission are deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and prophecy. It also highlights the authority of Scripture as a witness to Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>&#8216;They hated Me without reason.&#8217;</b><br>This is a quotation from the Psalms, specifically <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a> and <a href="/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>, which are considered Messianic Psalms. These Psalms express the suffering and unjust persecution of the righteous, which Christians interpret as foreshadowing the experiences of Jesus. The phrase "without reason" emphasizes the innocence of Jesus and the baseless nature of the hatred against Him. This connects to the broader theme of Jesus as the suffering servant, who is rejected by His own people despite His righteousness and divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

His suffering, then, is purposeful, foreknown, and essential to redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what is written</b><p>The phrase underscores the absolute authority of Scripture. Jesus does not appeal to feelings, tradition, or majority opinion; He stands on the written Word. &#8226; <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a> affirms that &#8220;all Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a> declares, &#8220;Scripture cannot be broken.&#8221; &#8226; In <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, He responds to temptation with &#8220;It is written,&#8221; modeling reliance on God&#8217;s Word as sufficient, final truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in their Law:</b><p>By saying &#8220;their Law,&#8221; Jesus references the entire Old Testament trusted by His hearers.

Other passages may, from their similarity, have been in Christ's mind, as receiving fulfillment or abundant illustration in their conduct. The use of the expression, "the Law," has been pressed by many as proof that the writer of this Gospel did not regard himself as a Jew at all. Such numerous indications occur of the opposite conclusion, that this expression must receive the more rational interpretation - the Law in which they pride themselves, the Law which is ever in their mouths, the Law which itself contains the portraiture of their spirit: <span class="cmt_word">They hated me gratuitously</span>; <span class="accented">causelessly</span>. The true Christ was, when he came, the object of reason-less, causeless hate and opposition. Jesus knew, when he claimed to be the Christ, that he would have to complete and fulfill the solemn portraiture of the suffering, burden-bearing, and rejected Christ, as well as that of the triumphant Christ and King. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But [this is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
