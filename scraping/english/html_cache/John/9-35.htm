Being "thrown out" of the synagogue was a significant social and religious exclusion, as the synagogue was central to Jewish community life. This act highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders. It also reflects the cost of discipleship and the division that Jesus' ministry was causing among the Jewish people.<p><b>He found the man</b><br>Jesus actively seeks out the man who had been healed, demonstrating His compassion and personal care. This action is consistent with Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). It also illustrates the personal relationship Jesus desires with individuals, contrasting with the impersonal and legalistic approach of the Pharisees.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&#8221;</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a significant messianic term that Jesus frequently uses for Himself. It has roots in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is depicted as a heavenly figure with authority and an everlasting kingdom.

The verse opens with His immediate awareness of the formerly blind man&#8217;s rejection. The Shepherd&#8217;s ears are always open&#8212;&#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). Just as Yahweh heard Israel&#8217;s groaning in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, Jesus listens when His people suffer social or religious ostracism. John later affirms this tenderness: &#8220;No one will snatch them out of My hand&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>). He hears, He cares, and He moves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they had thrown him out</b><p>Being &#8220;put out of the synagogue&#8221; (<a href="/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34</a>) meant more than losing membership&#8212;it severed community ties, financial prospects, and even family relationships. Jesus had warned, &#8220;They will put you out of the synagogues&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>). The man&#8217;s physical sight cost him social standing, yet his exile becomes the doorway to deeper revelation. <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a> shows the same pattern: being dishonored for the Name becomes honor itself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He found the man</b><p>The Good Shepherd does not leave a wounded sheep wandering. &#8220;For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). Jesus&#8217; initiative underscores grace: the man did not find Christ; Christ found him. <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a> pictures the Shepherd who &#8220;lays down His life for the sheep,&#8221; pursuing the one whom religion had discarded. Isolation becomes an appointment with divine pursuit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>Conversation, not condemnation, follows. Jesus models <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, &#8220;Come now, let us reason together.&#8221; As at the well in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7</a>, He opens dialogue that invites faith. Scripture&#8217;s consistent pattern is personal address&#8212;God speaks, hearts respond (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you believe</b><p>Everything narrows to trust. Miracles do not save; faith does. Jesus had taught, &#8220;The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>). Belief is not intellectual assent alone but reliance that receives a gift (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>). Notice the direct question: Jesus presses for personal decision, not second-hand theology.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Son of Man?</b><p>&#8220;Son of Man&#8221; recalls <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where One &#8220;like a son of man&#8221; receives universal dominion. Jesus links Himself to that prophetic figure while highlighting His shared humanity (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>) and heavenly origin (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>). By using this title, He reveals His messianic authority without catering to politicized expectations. The man who received physical sight is now invited to recognize the cosmic King standing before him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-35.htm">John 9:35</a> shows Jesus hearing the man&#8217;s rejection, seeking him out, engaging him, and calling him to faith in the divine-human Son of Man. The verse moves from social exclusion to divine embrace, from religious expulsion to personal revelation. Physical sight led to the greater miracle of spiritual sight, illustrating that Jesus always shepherds His own, pursues the outcast, and centers all hope on believing in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him.</span>--There is no hint of time or place. We may naturally suppose that this seeking and finding on the part of our Lord followed immediately on the expulsion by the Pharisees. His parents had. for fear of the Pharisees, forsaken him; and they who should have been as the shepherd of this sheep of the flock of Israel, had thrust him from them; but in his case, too, the words of the Psalmist were to be fulfilled, "When my father and my mother forsake me, the Lord taketh me up." The Good Shepherd, who gathereth the lambs with His arm, and carrieth them in His bosom, is at hand to lead him.<p><span class= "bld">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span>--There is much doubt about the true reading here. A majority of the best MSS. have "the Son of Man," which is the usual term applied by our Lord to Himself. But comp. Notes on <a href="/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>; and <a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a>. On the other hand, the reading, "Son of God," is certainly as old as the second century, and seems to supply the sense which the context requires. The man had been cast out. Our Lord hears of this, and knows it is because of his bold confession that He was a prophet. The lesson He had before taught him had been learnt, and had borne fruit. He will lead him from that confession to a higher one. He marks him out as distinct from others, and asks a question which is meant by its form to lead him to an affirmative answer, "<span class= "ital">Thou</span> believest on the Son of God?" This question follows naturally on the truth which the man had grasped. "If this Man were not of God, He could do nothing" (<a href="/john/9-33.htm" title="If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.">John 9:33</a>), and this title was one of the theocratic names of the Messiah. (Comp. <a href="/john/1-49.htm" title="Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.">John 1:49</a>.) The title, "Son of Man," could hardly have conveyed to him the same meaning. Its insertion in some of the MSS. here is probably to be traced to the fact that copyists substituted the title which our Lord more generally used for the rarer one. We should carefully bear in mind that though our Lord does not usually apply the title "Son of God" to Himself, He constantly asserts the truth which it expresses. (Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in this Gospel, John 5, 7, 8) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-41.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(10)</span> <span class="accented">The issues of the ministry of light</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-38.</span> - (a) The <span class="accented">vision of those who see not</span>. These verses narrate the sequel so far as the man was concerned. Westcott and others rather exaggerate the bearing of it when they say here was "the beginning of the new society." "The universal society is based on the confession of a new truth" (Westcott). Even in this Gospel the first chapter shows that Jesus gathered disciples about him who from that time onward were to "see angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man." In the second and fourth chapters he "made and baptized disciples." The twelve (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.) would not leave him in the midst of widespread disaffection, because they confessed that he was "the Holy One of God," who had "the words of eternal life." Consequently, it is enough to say that, when the authorities of the Jewish <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> excluded the disciple of Christ, the Lord admitted him to a nobler fellowship; but the fellowship, the society, had been already formed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus heard that they had east him out</span>; or, <span class="accented">thrust him forth</span>. Jesus is represented as "hearing," not from the man's own lips, but from the current report. He is not said to have become acquainted with the circumstance by intuition, but to have heard by the ordinary processes of knowledge. This simple touch shows how consistent the writer is throughout with the main thesis of his Gospel touching the perfect humanity of the Son of God, that he "was made flesh." and had "come in the flesh," though he was "from God." The excommunication noisily and widely bruited was further proof of the war to the knife between "the Jews" and Jesus. The man has fallen under the ban for practically avowing in the most public way that Jesus was "the Prophet," if not the Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And having found him</span>. So, then, the Lord, as the good Shepherd, sought out the lost sheep in the wilderness, and did not rest until he found him. The daylight that had made an altogether new world for one who had aforetime never looked on human face, had been strangely checkered and shadowed. He only saw angry faces and averted glances, and even his cowardly parents would have hesitated to receive him into their poor abode; but Jesus found him, <span class="cmt_word">and said, Dost thou believe on the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Son of God</span>? Not "Dost thou wish to believe?" but "Dost thou put thy trust in the Son of God?" Dost thou recognize the fact that the Messiah of the nation's hope has come? Art thou believing in him? It would be more natural that the more current appellation <span class="accented">Son of God</span>, rather than the more recondite idea of <span class="accented">Son of man</span>, should have been held out before the healed man. The "thou" is emphatic, and contrasts the state of the mind of this man with that of "the Jews." He had declared that his Healer was "from God," that he was "a Prophet," One who "did God's will," and whom "God heareth," even when he asked for apparently impossible things.
