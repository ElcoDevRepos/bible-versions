The "hour" often refers to significant moments in Jesus' ministry, particularly His passion and crucifixion. This reflects the fulfillment of divine timing, as seen in <a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a> and <a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>, where Jesus speaks of His "hour" in terms of His mission and glorification. The duality of "is coming and has already come" suggests the unfolding of God's plan, emphasizing the inevitability of the disciples' scattering.<p><b>when you will be scattered, each to his own home</b><br>This scattering fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>, "Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered." The disciples' dispersion highlights their human frailty and fear in the face of persecution. Historically, this scattering occurred after Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>). The phrase "each to his own home" underscores the personal retreat and isolation the disciples experienced, reflecting their initial inability to stand firm in their faith.<p><b>and you will leave Me all alone</b><br>This statement foreshadows the abandonment Jesus would face from His closest followers. It emphasizes the loneliness and betrayal He would endure, aligning with <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, which Jesus quotes on the cross, expressing His sense of forsakenness. Theologically, this abandonment highlights the depth of Jesus' sacrifice, as He faced the crucifixion without human support, fulfilling His role as the suffering servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me</b><br>Despite the physical abandonment by His disciples, Jesus affirms His unity with the Father. This reflects the intimate relationship within the Trinity, as seen throughout the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, <a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>).

Scripture presents history under God&#8217;s sovereign timetable, and Christ&#8217;s words remind us that every detail of His Passion unfolds exactly when the Father wills it (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and has already come</b><p>The event is no longer future&#8212;it has arrived. This immediacy underscores how quickly circumstances can change. Only minutes remain before Judas appears with soldiers (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>). Jesus&#8217; calm certainty echoes His later prayer, &#8220;Father, the hour has come&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>). Because God&#8217;s Word is true, what Jesus foresees is as certain as if it had already happened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when you will be scattered, each to his own home</b><p>The disciples, bold moments earlier (<a href="/john/13-37.htm">John 13:37</a>), will soon flee (<a href="/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>; <a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>). <a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered&#8221;&#8212;is coming to life before their eyes. Note the personal angle: &#8220;each to his own home.&#8221; Fear drives them to self-preservation, just as it drove Peter to warm himself by the fire rather than stand with Christ (<a href="/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17-18</a>). Their scattering highlights human weakness and the need for a Savior who never fails.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will leave Me all alone</b><p>Desertion compounds Jesus&#8217; physical suffering with relational pain (<a href="/psalms/69-20.htm">Psalm 69:20</a>). He feels&#8212;literally&#8212;the abandonment foretold in Scripture, yet He walks into it knowingly. John later records that while the disciples hid behind locked doors (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>), Jesus went to the cross alone. Still, their failure does not nullify His love; resurrection morning He will seek them out and restore them (<a href="/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19-23</a>; 21:15-17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Yet I am not alone</b><p>Here is the heartening contrast. Human companions vanish, but divine companionship remains. Earlier He said, &#8220;I am not alone, for I know where I came from and where I am going&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-16.htm">John 8:16</a>). On the cross He will say, &#8220;Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). Though forsaken by men, He rests in unbroken fellowship with His Father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the Father is with Me</b><p>This clause grounds Jesus&#8217; confidence. The eternal Son and the Father are one (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). The Father &#8220;has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>). Even when Jesus becomes sin for us (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) and cries, &#8220;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>), the triune purpose of redemption is perfectly intact. The Father&#8217;s presence sustains the Son, guaranteeing the success of the atoning work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a> shows Christ&#8217;s foreknowledge, the disciples&#8217; frailty, and the Father&#8217;s unfailing support. Jesus steps into the predetermined &#8220;hour,&#8221; is abandoned by friends, yet remains upheld by His Father. For believers, the verse reassures us that when earthly supports crumble, the faithful presence of God remains, just as sure and literal as it was for His Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come.</span>--Comp.

He, too, though apparently left alone, had His own home in the presence of the Father, which was ever with Him. The fact of their leaving Him could not in truth have added to His sense of loneliness. He must, even when surrounded by them, have always been alone. The thoughts of His mind were so infinitely beyond them, that the true sympathy which binds souls in companionship could never have had place. And yet He was never alone, for His life was one of constant communion with the Father.

This falling away from Jesus as he rises more and more into the greatness of his work is one of the witnesses of his Divine mission into such a world as this First the Galilaean hosts and the multitudes who shouted "Hosanna!" then his own brethren, then all except the twelve, then all the authorities, are openly hostile. Even Joseph and Nicodemus and Lazarus are silent, Judas is treacherous; but the eleven still cling to him. Soon Christ selects from the faithful few the faithfullest for the watch over his last agony, but one of these denies him, and they all forsake him and flee. John and his mother, who follow within earshot of the cross, are sent to their own home, and there is a moment when he is absolutely alone. He even says, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" But as in this agony he can still say, "Father, into thy hands," so here he anticipates the Divine overshadowing presence, and adds, <span class="cmt_word">Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> The sublimest word of all, charged with consolation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
