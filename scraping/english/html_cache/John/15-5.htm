The vine represents Jesus, and the branches symbolize His followers. In the Old Testament, Israel is often depicted as a vine or vineyard (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), but here, Jesus positions Himself as the true vine, indicating a new covenant relationship. This imagery emphasizes the intimate and life-giving connection between Christ and believers, highlighting dependence on Him for spiritual sustenance and growth.<p><b>The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit.</b><br>Remaining in Christ implies a continuous, active relationship characterized by faith, obedience, and love. This abiding is mutual, as Christ also remains in the believer, signifying the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit. Bearing fruit refers to the visible evidence of a transformed life, including the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and the fulfillment of God's purposes. This fruitfulness is a natural outcome of abiding in Christ, reflecting His character and advancing His kingdom.<p><b>For apart from Me you can do nothing.</b><br>This statement underscores the absolute necessity of reliance on Christ for any spiritual achievement or growth. It echoes the biblical theme of human insufficiency and divine sufficiency, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul declares that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. The phrase serves as a reminder of the futility of self-reliance and the essential role of divine empowerment in the believer's life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of the vine to describe His relationship with His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to remain in Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vine.htm">The Vine</a></b><br>A symbol of Jesus, representing the source of life and sustenance for believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_branches.htm">The Branches</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers, who must remain connected to Jesus to bear fruit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fruit-bearing.htm">Fruit-bearing</a></b><br>The event or outcome of remaining in Christ, signifying spiritual growth and productivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/abiding_in_christ.htm">Abiding in Christ</a></b><br>To "remain" in Christ means to maintain a close, personal relationship with Him through prayer, reading Scripture, and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_jesus.htm">Dependence on Jesus</a></b><br>Recognize that apart from Jesus, we can do nothing of eternal value.

It has been implied, but not directly stated, that they are the branches. It may be that there was a pause after the end of the fourth verse, accompanied by a look at the disciples, or at that which suggested the imagery of the vine. His words would then continue with the sense, "Yes, it is so. That is the true relation between us. I am the vine, ye are the branches. The fruitful branches represent men that abide in Me . . ."<p><span class= "bld">For without me ye can do nothing.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">separate from Me,</span> or, <span class= "ital">apart from Me.</span> (Comp. margin.) The words bring out the fulness of the meaning of the fruitfulness of the man who abides in Christ. It is he, and he only, who brings forth fruit, for the man who is separate from Christ can bear no fruit. The words have often been unduly pressed, to exclude all moral power apart from Christ, whereas the whole context limits them to the fruit-bearing of the Christian life. The persons thought of all through this allegory are true and false Christians, and nothing is said of the influence on men of the wider teaching of God, the Light of the Logos ever in the world. A moral power outside the limits of Christianity is clearly recognised in the New Testament. (Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>, Notes.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Christ returns to the main theme of the previous verse, but here discriminates more forcibly the vine from the branches, and yet holds and binds them into a unity. <span class="cmt_word">I am the vine, ye are the branches</span>; which shows that he treated the disciples themselves as the organs of his earthly fruit-bearing; and then draws a larger circle and makes a complete and comprehensive statement on which the very existence of the "true vine," the "body of Christ, including the Head," depends, viz. <span class="cmt_word">He that abideth in me, and I in him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whenever the conditions of which I have spoken to you are fulfilled; wherever there are human souls deriving from their connection with me the full advantage of the life ever streaming forth from me - <span class="cmt_word">the same beareth much fruit</span>; the entire end of their new life is secured. He beareth "much fruit." In other words, many of those blessed fruits of the supernatural life appear, which the great Husbandman desires to receive. And this strengthens the position of the previous verse, which threatened excision from the vine to such as bear no fruit. Such, though in one sense "in the Vine," do not <span class="accented">abide in him</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Because apart from</span> - severed from - <span class="cmt_word">me ye can do nothing</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> suggests the question - Can the negative result justify the positive assertion? It does in this way. There are two premises: the first is," I am the Vine, and ye are the branches," and the second is, "Severed front me a branch can effect nothing," having no independent fruitfulness or stability. All its powers are derived from this supernatural source, and depend on Christ's faithfulness to his own nature and functions; <span class="accented">therefore</span>, "He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit." The language here does not repress the endeavor of the human will after righteousness, nor pronounce a judgment on the great controversy between <span class="accented">Augustinians</span> and Pelagians. These words are not addressed to unconverted men, but to disciples, who have to learn their constant need of spiritual contact with their invisible Lord. Let a believer, let an apostle, sever himself from Christ, and live on his own past reputation or his supposed strength, on the clearness of his intellect, the vigor of his body, the eminence of his position, <span class="accented">he can and will do nothing</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#947;&#974;</span> <span class="translit">(Eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
