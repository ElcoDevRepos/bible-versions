In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus frequently uses such declarations to reveal deeper spiritual truths. This moment follows the healing of a man born blind, a miracle that serves as a sign of Jesus' divine authority and mission.<p><b>For judgment I have come into this world</b><br>Here, Jesus speaks of His role in bringing divine judgment. This is not merely punitive but also revelatory, exposing the true spiritual state of individuals. The concept of judgment in the Bible often involves separating truth from falsehood and light from darkness. Jesus' coming into the world fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>, where the Messiah is described as bringing justice and light to the nations.<p><b>so that the blind may see</b><br>This phrase has both a literal and metaphorical meaning. Literally, Jesus healed the physically blind, as seen in the preceding miracle. Metaphorically, it refers to spiritual enlightenment. Those who recognize their spiritual blindness and seek Jesus are granted sight, akin to the promise in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, where the eyes of the blind are opened. This reflects the transformative power of Christ's ministry.<p><b>and those who see may become blind</b><br>This statement addresses the spiritual blindness of those who believe they already possess understanding, such as the Pharisees. It highlights the irony that those confident in their spiritual insight often fail to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This theme is echoed in passages like <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>, where Jesus speaks of people who see but do not perceive.

His presence clarifies every choice, drawing a bright line between faith and unbelief, humility and pride, life and judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">For judgment I am come into this world.</span>--These words arise immediately out of what has preceded. The beggar has passed from a state of physical blindness, and has received the faculty of sight. He has passed from a state of spiritual blindness, and has received the power to recognise and believe on Jesus Christ as the Son of God. He did not see, but the result of the manifestation of the Messiah is for him that he now does see. Conscious of his own spiritual blindness, he asked, "Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?" and to him, as to every earnest and humble seeker after truth, because in all his seeming need he really "hath," there is given that he may "have more abundance." In marked contrast to this spirit of humility and desire to come to the light, was that of the Pharisees. They claimed to have the "key of knowledge" (<a href="/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>), and were, as a Pharisee represents him who is "called a Jew," "confident that they were guides of the blind, lights of them which are in darkness" (<a href="/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,">Romans 2:17</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.">1Corinthians 1:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.">1Corinthians 3:18</a>). Conscious of their own spiritual light, they felt no need of a truer Light, and therefore could not see it; and from them, as from every careless and self-trusting possessor of truth, because, in all his seeming abundance, he really <span class= "ital">"</span>hath not," there is taken away "even that he hath." (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>.)<p>This passing from darkness to light, and from light to darkness, suggests thoughts which our Lord has already uttered in <a href="/context/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17-19</a>, and which will meet us again more fully in <a href="/context/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37-50</a>. (See Notes on these passages.) Judgment is not the ultimate end of His coming, for He came to save the world; but it is an end, and therefore a result. The special form of the word rendered "judgment" in this place is used nowhere else by St. John, and indicates that what is here thought of is not the act of judging, but the concrete result--the sentence pronounced after judgment. His coming was a bringing light into the darkness of men's hearts, a testing of the false and the true, and as men accepted or rejected Him they pronounced a judicial sentence upon themselves. That light judged no man, and yet by it every man was judged. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39-41.</span> - (b) <span class="accented">The blindness of those who are satisfied with their twilight</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - The sight of the man, enlightened and prostrate in adoring gratitude, led Jesus, in the face of the bystanders, with Pharisees among them (ver. 40), to declare the general effects which would follow from his entire self-manifestation (so Meyer, Godet).

So far the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> declares itself to be a blessed consummation - sight to the blind, cleansing to the leper, life to the dead. Even the man born blind suns himself in the heaven of the Savior's smile. The Light of the world shines upon them, and they see. But Christ's coming brings out also the character of those, and pronounces judgment on those, who say of themselves, "<span class="accented">We</span> see;" "<span class="accented">We</span> have never been in bondage," "We need no repentance;" "<span class="accented">Abraham</span> is our father;" "<span class="accented">We</span> know the Law;" "Who (nevertheless) do not come to the Light;" who are not "of the truth;" and the beaming of his unappreciated glory involves in their case, <span class="cmt_word">that those who see might become blind</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), incapable of seeing. Those who have the knowledge of the Law, "<span class="accented">the</span> wise and prudent" (<a href="/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>), who boast their freedom, their knowledge, their advantages, their profession, may, nay do, by resolute turning away from "<span class="accented">the</span> Light of this world," lose their power of spiritual vision. But the unsophisticated, needy, even the publicans and harlots, consciously sitting in the region of the shadow of death, do by faith and repentance find that the great Light has unawares shone upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declared,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
