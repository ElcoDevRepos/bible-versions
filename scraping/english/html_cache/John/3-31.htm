"Above" signifies His heavenly origin, contrasting with earthly origins. This aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word who was with God and was God, highlighting His preexistence and divinity. The phrase "above all" underscores His sovereignty over all creation, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where all things are created through Him and for Him. This also fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which speaks of a divine ruler.<p><b>The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth.</b><br>This refers to human limitations and the natural, finite perspective of earthly beings. In contrast to Jesus, who is from above, those from the earth have a limited understanding and authority. This can be seen in the context of John the Baptist, who, despite being a great prophet, acknowledges his earthly origin and limitations in <a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>. The phrase highlights the distinction between divine revelation and human wisdom, as echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.<p><b>The One who comes from heaven is above all.</b><br>Reiterating the supremacy of Jesus, this phrase confirms His heavenly origin and ultimate authority. It reflects the consistent theme in John's Gospel of Jesus as the sent one from the Father, as seen in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where Jesus states He came down from heaven to do the will of the Father. This also connects to <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory, indicating His divine kingship.

"He who is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh." The first marks out the Baptist's origin, as opposed to Him that cometh from above; the second asserts that the nature is, in accord with this origin, human and limited in faculty, as opposed to that of Him who is above all; the third declares that his teaching is from the standpoint of human nature and limited faculty, embracing indeed divine subjects and receiving divine revelation (<a href="/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>), but having this treasure in earthen vessels, imperfectly realising it, and imperfectly teaching it (<a href="/john/3-33.htm" title="He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.">John 3:33</a>). Then the contrast carries him away from this thought of self, in all its weakness, to dwell on the fulness of the teaching of the perfect Teacher, and he emphatically repeats, with the change of words suggested by "of the earth," what he has before said of it, "He that cometh from heaven is above all."<p>This repetition is the answer to the jealousy of his disciples, who wished to place him in a position of rivalry with Jesus. It is the answer to all self-assertion on the part of human teachers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-36.</span> - A large number of commentators of all schools hold that the remaining verses of this chapter give us the reflections of the evangelist rather than a continuous discourse of the Baptist. Strauss, Weisse, Reuss, and Bretschneider, who make the supposed proof of this Johannine appendix to the Baptist's words an evidence of inhistoricity throughout the Gospel, and the school of Baur, which finds in the entire representation simply an artistic endeavour on the part of a second century <span class="accented">falsarius</span> to show that John's disciples were absorbed into the Catholic Church, are joined here by Bengel, De Wette, Westcott, Moulton, and Edersheim, who see no difficulty in the introduction of these sentiments, which correspond with those of the Epistles of John, as an appendix of the evangelist, and not a reminiscence of the teaching of the Baptist. The reasons in favour of this view are that the ideas and phraseology are said to be far in advance of John the Baptist's theological position, and certainly reflect the later teaching of the Master. We will consider some of these <span class="accented">seriatim</span>, but cannot accept the argument as final. Hengstenberg, Meyer, Godet, Alford, Lange, even Renan, do not yield to the positions thus assumed, nor will they admit any word of the Baptist here uttered to be inconsistent with the known doctrine of the forerunner; whereas they urge that the simple communication to John of the substance of our Lord's discourse to Nicodemus is adequate explanation of the similarities between the two. It may be admitted that some subjective colouring from the apostle's own mind may have been transfused by him into his report of both discourses, which we cannot doubt (whatever may be said about the Galilaean ministry) were conducted in the Aramaic tongue. Weiss makes the pertinent suggestion that we cannot think that John the son of Zebedee beard the final testimony of the Baptist. It may easily have been communicated to the circle around Jesus by Andrew and some other disciple of the two masters. This may account for the appearance throughout the discourse of more Johannine language than usual. If we cannot, or may not, make these simple hypotheses, then we too should be disposed to think that the subjective element had so predominated as almost to hide the historic quality of the whole of this swanlike song of the Old Testament dispensation. But the hypotheses seem to be highly probable and extremely natural, and the coherence of the passage with what has gone before to be obvious and complete. The discourse contrasts the entire prophetic ministry with that of the Son of God (vers. 31, 32), which then sets forth the menus of appropriating the Divine gift of the Son of God (vers. 33-35), and predicts the awful issues of rejecting the supreme claims of the Divine Lord (ver. 36). The teaching is in accord with Old Testament doctrine, illumined, as we learn that John's was, by special visions, and by communications to him of the significance of the Lord's uttered words. It is quite irrelevant, if not absurd, to say that such a testimony of the forerunner makes the cotinuance or spread of John's teaching and baptism impossible; for <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words were obviously addressed to a small group only of the many thousands who heard John preach, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it does not follow that all those who heard these memorable words should have deserted their first master, even in deference to his own advice. The words that follow, whether a simple record of John's discourse or one deeply coloured by the subjectivity of the evangelist, are as follows: - <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is coming from above is above all.</span> Now, it is obvious that Jesus had spoken of the Son of man as having come down from heaven (ver. 13), and of his own power to speak of heavenly things (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of causes and measures of Divine operations); and he contrasts these with the "earthly things" of which he too had spoken - "earthly" they were because they dealt with experiences felt and witnessed and realized on earth. Now, John is represented, on the occasion of the baptism of our Lord, as being convinced that Jesus was "the Son of God," and that his existence was prior to his own, and that his rank in the universe was one utterly transcending his own. These statements have been already put into the lips of John by the fourth evangelist, and are scarcely exceeded, if at all, by the utterance before us. We find a bold contrast between the Logos himself and the witness to the manifested Logos. <span class="accented">He who cometh from above</span>, being before John, and being, therefore, in his essential dignity, superior to him, <span class="accented">is above all</span>, and therefore above him. <span class="cmt_word">He that is,</span> in his origin and the entire self-realization of his life, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, and not incarnate Logos, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the earth</span> in quality, <span class="cmt_word">and speaketh of the earth</span> (observe, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;</span> is here used). The experiences to which he refers are enacted on the earth, and he has no power to go back and heavenwards for the full explanation of them. Higher than heaven are the thoughts and revelations of the Son of God. He can unveil the heart of the eternal Father. Christ can link his own work with the ministry of the mightiest of the Heaven-sent messengers; but John starts from the consciousness, the perils, the self-deceptions and contrition of man. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">that cometh out of heaven is above all.</span> This great utterance is repeated, and it involves little more than what John had implied to the Sanhedrin (<a href="/john/1-30.htm">John 1:30-34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [One who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
