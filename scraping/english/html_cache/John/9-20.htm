This reflects the societal pressure and fear of excommunication from the synagogue, as the Jewish leaders had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue (<a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>). The parents' cautious response highlights the tension between the emerging Christian faith and established Jewish authority.<p><b>We know he is our son</b><br>The parents affirm their relationship to the man, establishing their credibility as witnesses. This statement underscores the authenticity of the miracle, as they confirm the identity of the man who was healed. In Jewish culture, family lineage and identity were significant, often tied to one's social and religious standing. This acknowledgment also serves to validate the miraculous nature of the healing, as it confirms the man's lifelong condition.<p><b>and we know he was born blind</b><br>The parents attest to the fact that their son was born blind, emphasizing the miraculous nature of his healing. This detail is crucial because it rules out any possibility of a temporary or psychosomatic condition. The healing of congenital blindness was unprecedented, underscoring Jesus' divine authority and fulfilling messianic prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened. This miracle serves as a type of spiritual enlightenment, illustrating Jesus as the Light of the World who brings spiritual sight to those in darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, serving as a testament to Jesus' divine power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents.htm">The Parents</a></b><br>The parents of the man born blind, who are questioned by the Pharisees about their son's healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who are skeptical of Jesus and seek to discredit His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man, demonstrating His divine nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_acknowledgment.htm">Faith and Acknowledgment</a></b><br>The parents acknowledge their son and his condition, but their fear of the Pharisees prevents them from fully acknowledging Jesus' role.

Compare the similar tension in <a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a>, where many &#8220;believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their measured answer underscores the reliability of eyewitness testimony, a theme John returns to often (<a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We know he is our son</b><p>&#8226; This first certainty is anchored in intimate relationship. Parents are the primary witnesses to their child&#8217;s identity; no one can credibly dispute their word here.<p>&#8226; Personal knowledge carries weight. The same principle appears in <a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a> where Jesus says, &#8220;Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their statement pushes back against any rumor that the healed man is an imposter. The Pharisees must reckon with genuine facts, not manufactured doubt.<p>&#8226; The real-life connection between parent and child anticipates the believer&#8217;s assurance in <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>: &#8220;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God&#8217;s children.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we know he was born blind</b><p>&#8226; The second certainty addresses the man&#8217;s condition from birth, emphasizing the magnitude of the miracle. They are not talking about a temporary ailment but a lifelong disability (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a> records a parallel example&#8212;&#8220;a man lame from birth&#8221;&#8212;highlighting how God often uses undeniable, lifelong conditions to display His power unmistakably.<p>&#8226; Recognizing congenital blindness also echoes the spiritual reality that every person is born incapable of seeing God&#8217;s kingdom apart from His intervention (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By stating the former blindness plainly, the parents remove any escape hatch for skeptics: either accept the miracle or reject clear evidence, echoing the challenge Elijah posed in <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/9-20.htm">John 9:20</a> presents two simple, uncontested facts&#8212;parentage and congenital blindness&#8212;confirmed by the very people most qualified to testify. Their brief, truthful answer builds an unshakable foundation for the miracle&#8217;s authenticity, leaving the Pharisees to confront the works of God or harden their hearts. The verse reminds us that honest testimony, even when offered under pressure, powerfully affirms God&#8217;s deeds and points listeners to the undeniable reality of Jesus&#8217; saving power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">We know that this is our son . . .</span>--The two earlier questions of matter of fact they can answer with certainty.
