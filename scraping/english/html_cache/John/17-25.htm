The term "Father" reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and God, highlighting the familial bond and authority. This echoes the Old Testament understanding of God as a righteous judge (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>) and a loving father (<a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>).<p><b>Although the world has not known You</b><br>The "world" often refers to humanity in rebellion against God. This phrase underscores the spiritual blindness and ignorance prevalent among those who do not follow God (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). It reflects the theme of light versus darkness found in <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>, where the world did not recognize Jesus.<p><b>I know You</b><br>Jesus' knowledge of the Father is unique and complete, signifying His divine nature and unity with God (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). This intimate knowledge is a fulfillment of the prophetic relationship between the Messiah and God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, where the Servant knows God's will.<p><b>And they know that You sent Me</b><br>"They" refers to the disciples and believers who recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This acknowledgment is a result of divine revelation and faith (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-17</a>). The sending of Jesus by the Father is a central theme in John's Gospel, emphasizing His mission and divine authority (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>). This also connects to the concept of Jesus as the Apostle, or "sent one," fulfilling the role of the ultimate prophet and mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is praying to the Father.

This title reassures the disciples that every part of the plan unfolding&#8212;even the cross looming hours away&#8212;is rooted in God&#8217;s perfect righteousness (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By using &#8220;Father,&#8221; Jesus reminds us of the intimate relationship He shares with God, inviting believers into that same family dynamic (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>although the world has not known You</b><p>&#8226;

This claim validates every teaching and action of Christ; He speaks firsthand for God (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Jesus fully knows the Father, He can reveal Him without error (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they know that You sent Me</b><p>&#8226;

The verse assures believers that their faith rests on the unbreakable bond between the righteous Father and the sent Son, a bond that secures their place in God&#8217;s family and propels them to bear witness in an unbelieving world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">the world indeed knew Thee not.</span> In these closing words of His prayer, our Lord again solemnly appeals to the Father (comp. Notes on <a href="/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.">John 17:11</a>), but now with the special thought of the Father's righteousness. This thought follows upon the prayer that those whom the Father had given Him may be where He is, and behold the divine glory; and the connection seems to be in the thought that sinful humanity cannot see God and live. The world, indeed, knew not God (comp. <a href="/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>; <a href="/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>), but the Son knew God, and the disciples had recognised that He had been sent by God, and in their knowledge of Him had passed through a moral' change, by which they were no longer of the world, but were sons of God (<a href="/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The prayer is thus over, and once more the great High Priest and Victim declares concerning himself some of the mysteries of his Person and of his relation with his disciples and with the world. <span class="cmt_word">O righteous Father</span> (cf. Vers. 1, 5, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> simply; Ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>; Ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> without any characterization). The righteousness of God is a more exalted perfection than his holiness, one that might seem more at variance with the exercise of his paternal compassion; yet this righteousness is conspicuously displayed in the redemptive love which Christ had thus manifested, and the beloved disciple (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>) declares that God is faithful and "righteous" in forgiving the repentant sinner. The blending of the idea of righteousness with Fatherhood is the sublime revelation made by the Lord Jesus, and he gathers the two ideas together into an indissoluble unity. Justice and mercy are seen by the whole work of the Son of God to have been the outflow and effulgence of the one all-comprehending and infinite love. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> that here follows has created some difficulty, though some manuscripts emit it (D and Vulgate), probably in consequence of its inappropriateness; but it is received on strong ancient authority. Meyer and Hengstenberg take it thus: <span class="accented">Righteous Father</span> (<span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">such thou art</span>), <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">yet</span>) <span class="accented">the world knew thee not</span>. But would our Lord have hesitated, as it were, to express this truth, without justifying it against the unbelief of the world? Moulton tries to explain the simple adversative force of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by "both the world learned not to know thee, but I learned to know thee." Godet has expressed the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> more effectively by translating, <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">world</span>, <span class="accented">it is true</span>, <span class="accented">knew thee not</span>, <span class="accented">but I knew thee</span>. The Revised Version has, with the Authorized Version, simply omitted the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>. It is one of the most solemn of the Lord's condemnations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Apostle Paul said (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>), "The world through its wisdom knew not God;" and in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-23</a> he shows that this ignorance was willful and practical and without excuse. The history of the struggling of the world after God has shown how dense the human darkness is. There have been signs that men groped after the idea of a Father who should be blind to their faults and indifferent to their follies, and utter a righteous Lord who has exalted righteousness and hated iniquity; but it was left for Christ to blend these apparently discordant beams into the radiance of a perfect glory. How many illustrations do the sad and shameless perversions of human intelligence supply! <span class="cmt_word">But I knew thee</span>, because of the eternity of that ineffable love wherewith thou hast loved me, and because of the depth of that righteous love which thou hast manifested to the world in sending me upon my mission. <span class="cmt_word">And these knew</span> - came to know by personal intuition - <span class="cmt_word">that thou didst send me</span> (cf. <a href="/john/16-27.htm">John 16:27</a>, and Vers. 8, 23) on the mission of redeeming the world.
