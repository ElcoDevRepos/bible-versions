In the context of the Gospel of John, this statement underscores the divinity of Jesus and His unique relationship with God the Father. The concept of shared possession reflects the Trinitarian belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one in essence. This unity is also seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus states, "I and the Father are one." The claim that everything belonging to the Father is also Christ's indicates His divine authority and role in the Godhead, affirming His deity and pre-existence as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>.<p><b>That is why I said that the Spirit will take from what is Mine</b><br>Here, Jesus introduces the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The Spirit's role is to reveal and communicate the truths of Christ to His followers. This reflects the ongoing work of the Spirit in guiding, teaching, and reminding believers of Jesus' teachings, as promised in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. The Spirit's taking from what is Christ's signifies the transmission of divine truth and wisdom, ensuring that the teachings of Jesus remain active and relevant in the lives of His disciples. This also highlights the cooperative work within the Trinity, where the Spirit acts in accordance with the will and purpose of the Son.<p><b>and disclose it to you.</b><br>The disclosure by the Spirit is a promise of revelation and understanding for the disciples. This assurance is crucial for the early church as they navigate their mission after Jesus' ascension. The Spirit's role in disclosing truth is foundational for the writing of the New Testament, as the apostles were inspired to record the teachings and works of Jesus. This promise of disclosure is not limited to the apostles but extends to all believers, as the Spirit continues to illuminate the Scriptures and guide Christians in truth. This ongoing revelation is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, explaining the relationship between Himself, the Father, and the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, emphasizing the unity and shared authority within the Trinity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit is described as the one who will receive from Jesus and make known to the disciples, highlighting His role in revelation and guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who would later receive the Holy Spirit's guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room_discourse.htm">The Upper Room Discourse</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, where Jesus imparts crucial truths to His disciples before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_of_the_trinity.htm">Unity of the Trinity</a></b><br>This verse highlights the perfect unity and shared authority within the Trinity.

The ground of this saying is in the fact that the Son is the Revealer of the Father, and that the fulness of the truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>) is given unto Him. The words appear from the context not to express the spiritual relation of the Son to the Father, but the fulness of the communication to Him in His human nature of the divine truth which He should reveal to man. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="/john/8-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.">John 8:42</a>; <a href="/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; <a href="/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="/context/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2-3</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - In this verse our Lord makes a still more superlative claim. <span class="cmt_word">All things which the Father hath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">are mine</span>. Perhaps no sentence recorded by St. John is more difficult to reconcile with the mere humanity of our Lord, even of the loftiest kind. The "mine" of the previous verse is declared to embrace something more than the mystery of his Person and sacrifice. "All that the Father hath," all his fullness of being, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, all the power, all the effulgence of the glory of the Father, of the human race, and of all things, "are mine." This makes a spiritual apprehension of Christ include a perfect revelation of all the Father's character and work. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said</span> <span class="cmt_word">I, that he</span> (the Spirit of truth, in being your Guide into all the truth) <span class="cmt_word">taketh of mine, and will declare</span> (it) <span class="cmt_word">unto you</span>. Because "mine is the Father's, and the Father's is mine;" because, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he is the Center, and Agent, and Motive, and Force in all the Divine self-revelation, and because he possessed as his own this vast range, this infinite fullness of Divine operations, he promised them this spiritual teaching, and assured them that his highest glory was simply to be made known as he is. Calvin, "We see how the greater part of men deceive themselves; for they pass by Christ, and go out of the way to seek God by circuitous paths." In these verses we have a very abundant exhibition of the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, coupled with a very remarkable setting forth of the tri-personality. The Father "hath" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) that which is in very. essence the Son's (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); and the Spirit, whose purpose is to glorify the Son by making him known to men (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), takes of "mine" and will declare it (see Stier, Schaff, note to Lange). Luthardt once thought with Stier, but now limits the reference, without giving any reason for it, to what he calls "the deposit of Divine truth in the humanity of Jesus." The sum of this astonishing assurance is that the Holy Spirit of truth, an essential element if not Personality in the Godhead, will lead these apostles into the fullness of truth, and of knowledge of the future, by taking up the essential realities of the Christ in the fullness of his being and work, and disclosing them by spiritual insight and supernatural quickening. These realities of the Christ will prove to be the fullness of the Father's heart - all that the Father hath. Again we ask - Does St. John even here travel beyond his prologue? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/16-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Everything</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(panta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
