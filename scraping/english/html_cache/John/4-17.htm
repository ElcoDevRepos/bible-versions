The woman's statement reflects her current marital status, which is significant in the context of her life and the cultural norms of the time. In first-century Samaria, marriage was a central institution, and a woman's identity was often tied to her husband. Her admission of having no husband reveals her vulnerability and possibly her social marginalization, as later verses indicate she had multiple past relationships. This interaction occurs at Jacob's well, a significant historical and religious site for both Jews and Samaritans, symbolizing a place of divine encounter and revelation.<p><b>Jesus said to her,</b><br>Jesus' response to the woman is notable for its directness and compassion. In a cultural context where Jewish men typically avoided public conversations with women, especially Samaritan women, Jesus' engagement with her breaks social norms and demonstrates His mission to reach all people, regardless of gender or ethnicity. This encounter foreshadows the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament.<p><b>"You are correct to say that you have no husband."</b><br>Jesus acknowledges the truth of the woman's statement, which serves to establish His omniscience and authority. By affirming her honesty, Jesus opens the door for a deeper spiritual conversation. This acknowledgment also highlights Jesus' role as a prophet, as He reveals knowledge of her personal life that she had not disclosed. This moment is a turning point in the narrative, leading to the woman's recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. Theologically, this interaction illustrates the concept of Jesus as the "Living Water," offering spiritual fulfillment beyond physical or relational needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A central figure in this passage, she encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.

It lays bare to her own consciousness the past and present life, but she does not know that it is laid bare to His. The reply is no longer prefaced by the half-sarcastic "Thou, being a Jew," or the reverential "Sir." The tone has passed from vivacity to earnestness, and from earnestness to sadness. That one word--what a history it has revealed! But she will hide it from Him and from herself. "I have no husband" (or, according to the Sinaitic MS., more emphatically still, <span class= "ital">A husband I have not</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The woman answered, and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou said correctly, Husband have I none: for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. This true thing hast thou spoken.</span> The woman resists the description which Jesus assumes that she bears to the man with whom she stands in illegal relations. Convinced, brought to bay, she cannot lie to Jesus. She says, in penitence and shame, "I have no husband." There is no concealment of the fact; she must need the cleansing of the life-giving stream. Jesus, not without a tone of solemn remonstrance, accuses her of a life of loose morals. It is implied that the first five husbands were conventionally allowable; but the suggestion is that, either by divorce or wanton rushing to further nuptials if the former had been ruptured by death, her character had been ever deteriorating until, under present circumstances, she was committing an overt act of illegality and impurity. "In saying thou hast no husband, thou hast spoken to the point, and for the reasons I recite thou hast made a true statement." As the woman in ver. 27 tells her friends "He told me all things that ever I did," we may easily believe that she felt, under his searching glance, that no folly, no weakness, no rebellious deed, no damning compromise, was hidden from him. How much more he said we can only conjecture. The revelation thus recorded is akin to other events in our Lord's life, which we cannot account for by the supposition that information concerning her had been conveyed by some rumour which thus he flashed upon her. This would suffer from the intolerable supposition that his claim to have prophetic light was a self-conscious fraud, and that by such a subterfuge the entire Samaritan mission had been characterized and controlled. Lunge thought that the definite traces of the five marriages were in some mysterious fashion hieroglyphed upon her face. This is a great extravagance of the working of natural law, to avoid the supernatural perception which our Lord exercised whenever he chose to draw upon the inexhaustible resources and powers at his disposal. Hengstenberg ('Contributions to Genuineness of the Pentateuch,' and in his 'Commentary'), while he recognizes the historical fact here mentioned and penetrated by our Lord, considered that there was a twofold meaning in our Lord's reply. Thou hast had five husbands; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there were five gods - those of Cuthah, Babylon, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 9:14, 3; <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>), whose worship by spiritual adultery the Samaritan people (of which you are a representative) have tolerated, and HE, Jehovah, whom thou now hast by surreptitious claim, is not thy covenanted Lord. Unfortunately, this too ingenious interpretation fails, first of all in this, that to the five nations <span class="accented">seven</span> gods are reckoned (<a href="/2_kings/17-30.htm">2 Kings 17:30, 31</a>). Again, it is inconceivable that the worship of Jehovah should be represented as on a par with these idolatries, and that Jehovah himself should be set forth as the sixth and worst of the theocratic husbands of the Samaritan state. Nor can we suppose that Christ, who said such wondrous things about the spirituality and the love of God to man, and was in the same breath about to utter one of the grandest of them, should thus have poured contumely on the Samaritan worship of Jehovah. Thoma practically adopts Hengstenberg's speculative interpretation. Strauss (1st and 2nd edit. 'Leb. Jes.') made use of Hengstenberg's admission to find in the whole narrative a mythical fiction; and Keim has only made matters worse by ascribing the entire narrative to the unknown author of the Fourth Gospel. Christ's own Divine penetration revealed the woman to herself, and she knew how hateful her life must have been in his sight. She made no attempt at denial, or concealment, or self-justification. The events referred to had burnt themselves on her memory, and her only refuge is in a bold admission of the right of the unknown Stranger to teach. She concedes his claim to solve perplexities, and penetrate other mysteries as well as the depths of her own heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ech&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
