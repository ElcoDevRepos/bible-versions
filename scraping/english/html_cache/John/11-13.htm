The term "sleep" is often used metaphorically in Scripture to describe death, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-14</a> and <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>. This metaphor reflects the temporary nature of death for believers, suggesting a future awakening or resurrection.

This statement sets the stage for the miracle of raising Lazarus, which serves as a powerful sign of Jesus' identity as the "resurrection and the life" (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>). The event foreshadows Jesus' own resurrection and underscores His victory over death.

They remind us how naturally we lean on human reasoning until the Lord opens our eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Jesus was talking about actual sleep</b><p>&#8226; Natural sleep is God-given for refreshment (<a href="/psalms/3-5.htm">Psalm 3:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a>). The disciples likely envisioned Lazarus recovering in bed, not lying in a tomb.<p>&#8226; Their reaction shows a compassionate desire to let a sick friend rest, yet it also reveals how limited human perception can be when God is working on a higher plane (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Like them, we may misread circumstances by focusing on the immediate and physical instead of the eternal and spiritual (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but He was speaking</b><p>&#8226; Jesus often used everyday terms to convey spiritual realities&#8212;parables, metaphors, and figures of speech (<a href="/john/16-25.htm">John 16:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Here He deliberately chose the word &#8220;sleep&#8221; to describe death, just as He did when He raised Jairus&#8217;s daughter: &#8220;She is not dead but asleep&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-52.htm">Luke 8:52-53</a>).<p>&#8226; This language signals His sovereign authority; for the Son of God, awakening a corpse is as effortless as rousing a sleeper (<a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about the death of Lazarus</b><p>&#8226; By equating death with sleep, Jesus declares it temporary for those who believe in Him.

The disciples heard &#8220;sleep&#8221; and pictured natural rest; Jesus meant physical death&#8212;something He would soon reverse to display His glory. Their misunderstanding sets the stage for a miracle that proves death is only &#8220;sleep&#8221; in the hands of the Savior who wakes the dead to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">They thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</span>--These words forbid the thought that they really understood that Lazarus was dead, but did not wish to seem to know it. Three of them, indeed, had heard our Lord apply the word "sleep" to death before (<a href="/matthew/9-24.htm" title="He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.">Matthew 9:24</a>), but this instance of misunderstanding on their part takes its place with others of a like kind, as showing that the surface meaning of words was that which naturally suggested itself to them. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6-12</a>, and <a href="/luke/22-38.htm" title="And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.

His absence may be taken as one of the reasons why the account of the miracle which follows is absent from St. Mark's Gospel, which is, like St. John's, the Gospel of an eye-witness.
