In biblical theology, God is often described as the source of all life, having no beginning or end (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). The concept of God having life "in Himself" underscores His independence and self-sufficiency, distinguishing Him from all created beings who derive their life from Him. This self-existence is a foundational attribute of God, aligning with the Old Testament revelation of God as "I AM" (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>), indicating His eternal presence and unchanging nature.<p><b>so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the unique relationship between the Father and the Son, Jesus Christ. The granting of life to the Son signifies the divine authority and equality shared between them. It reflects the doctrine of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons yet one in essence. The Son's possession of life in Himself points to His divinity and role as the giver of eternal life (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This authority to have life in Himself is also a testament to the Son's role in the resurrection and judgment, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>. Theologically, this phrase affirms the Son's pre-existence and His active participation in creation (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>), as well as His power to grant eternal life to believers (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, who is the source of all life and existence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, who is granted life in Himself by the Father.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_granting_of_life.htm">The Granting of Life</a></b><br>This event or action signifies the divine authority and power given to Jesus by the Father, emphasizing His deity and role in salvation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_life_and_authority.htm">Divine Life and Authority</a></b><br>Jesus possesses life in Himself, a divine attribute that underscores His equality with the Father and His authority over life and death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/source_of_eternal_life.htm">Source of Eternal Life</a></b><br>Believers are reminded that eternal life is found in Christ alone, encouraging reliance on Him for spiritual sustenance and salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_trinity.htm">Understanding the Trinity</a></b><br>This verse provides insight into the relationship within the Trinity, where the Father and the Son share divine attributes, yet maintain distinct roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Knowing that Jesus has life in Himself assures believers of the certainty and security of their salvation in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_worship.htm">Call to Worship</a></b><br>Recognizing Jesus' divine nature and authority should lead believers to worship Him with reverence and awe.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_26_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_26_Jesus_divine_link_to_God.htm">How does John 5:26 affirm Jesus' divine authority and relationship with the Father?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_life_in_Himself_for_Jesus.htm">What does "life in Himself" mean for understanding Jesus' divine nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_5_26_Genesis_2_7_on_life.htm">How does John 5:26 connect with Genesis 2:7 about God giving life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_life_power_daily.htm">How can we apply the truth of Jesus' life-giving power in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Jesus_authority_on_faith_2.htm">How does recognizing Jesus' authority in John 5:26 impact your faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_5_26_Jesus_divinity_proof.htm">How does John 5:26 affirm the divinity of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_5_26_Father-Son_relationship.htm">What does John 5:26 reveal about the relationship between the Father and the Son?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_5_26_and_eternal_life_link.htm">How does John 5:26 support the concept of eternal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_eternal_generation.htm">What is the concept of Eternal Generation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/has_anyone_ever_seen_god.htm">What does believing in the Son of God mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_the_trinity_concept_illogical.htm">Isn't the concept of the Trinity illogical?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_god's_age.htm">What is God's age?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 5:26 Mean</div><b>For as the Father</b><p>Jesus roots His claim in the Father&#8217;s identity. From creation onward, Scripture presents the Father as the ultimate source of everything (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). In <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5</a> the Lord has just called God &#8220;My Father&#8221; (5:17-18), emphasizing intimate unity yet personal distinction. Because the Father alone is uncreated, every other form of life derives from Him.<p>Bullet points to keep in mind:<p>&#8226; The Father eternally exists, independent of anything outside Himself (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His works include sustaining the universe each moment (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This declaration frames the Son&#8217;s authority within the Father&#8217;s eternal reality (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has life in Himself</b><p>The phrase underscores self-existence. God is not merely alive; He is life (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). No external power keeps Him alive or fuels Him. By declaring the Father&#8217;s self-existent life, Jesus draws a straight line from divine nature to divine action: because the Father possesses life intrinsically, He can impart life to others (<a href="/john/6-57.htm">John 6:57</a>).<p>Key observations:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Life&#8221; here is more than biological existence; it is the spiritual, eternal quality that only God possesses (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; This life flows outward&#8212;creation, redemption, resurrection all spring from the Father&#8217;s self-existent life (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so also He has granted</b><p>&#8220;Granted&#8221; highlights purposeful bestowal. The Father willingly shares His own prerogative with the Son (<a href="/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>; 5:22). Far from implying inferiority, the language reveals harmony within the Godhead&#8212;what the Father possesses, the Son fully exercises.<p>Consider how Scripture fleshes this out:<p>&#8226; The Father &#8220;sent&#8221; the Son (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-17</a>), &#8220;loves&#8221; the Son (<a href="/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a>), and &#8220;exalts&#8221; Him (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Every grant is relational, anchoring the Son&#8217;s mission in the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The perfect unity keeps divine authority undivided, even as roles differ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Son to have life in Himself</b><p>Here lies the heart of the verse: the Son shares the same self-existent life. At the Incarnation He retained full deity (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-4, 14</a>). Thus He can:<p>&#8226; Give eternal life to believers (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>; 17:2).<p>&#8226; Call the dead from the grave (<a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28-29</a>; 11:25-26).<p>&#8226; Serve as the exclusive way, truth, and life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>Because the Son has life in Himself, faith in Him brings immediate spiritual life and guarantees bodily resurrection (<a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11-12</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a> reveals the shared divine life of Father and Son. The Father is eternally self-existent; out of that fullness He grants the same self-existent life to the Son. Consequently, Jesus can bestow life, judge the world, and secure our eternal destiny. Trusting Him is not aligning with a mere prophet but embracing the living God who holds life within Himself and freely offers it to all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Hath he given to the Son.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">gave He to the Son also.</span><p><span class= "bld">Life in himself.</span>--The Son has spoken of the dead hearing His voice and living, but this giving of life to others can only be by one who has in himself an original source of life. This the Father has, and this the Son also has. To the Son in His pre-existent state it was natural, as being equal with the Father. To the Son who had emptied Himself of the exercise of the attributes which constituted the glory of that state (comp. again <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> it was part of the Father's gift by which He exalted Him exceedingly, and gave Him the name which is above every name. It was, then, a gift in time to One who had possessed it before all time, and for the purposes of the mediatorial work had relinquished it. It was a gift, not to the Eternal Son, but to the Incarnate Word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - This verse, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, shows that the statement about to follow will sustain some portion of the previous one. Which portion? As it seems to me, the coming clause justifies the alteration of the term "the Son" <span class="accented">into</span> "the Son of God;" and declares, more fully than any other passage in the New Testament, the lofty and unique character of the Sonship which he claimed. <span class="cmt_word">For even as the Father hath life in himself</span> - the sublime assumption of the self-existence and eternal being of the Father, the absolute Possessor of life <span class="accented">per se</span>, the Source ultimate and efficient of all that is connoted by life, the eternal Fountain of life - <span class="cmt_word">in like manner also he gave to the Son to have Life in himself</span>. "He generated," as Augustine has it, "such a Son who should have life in himself, not as a participator in life, but one who should be as he himself is - Life itself." It is the <span class="accented">bona fide</span> expression of community of nature, attribute, quality, and possession of Godhead. In virtue of this utterance, the evangelist, learning from the consciousness of Christ through long years of meditation, under the power of the Spirit, eventually formulated the doctrine of the prologue, "In him was life." "The Son," or the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, is, so far as this Sonship is concerned, the veritable Son of God with such a fulness of life power and such a fountain of life flowing from him, that his voice is the voice of the Eternal Son. This is the primary meaning, though since the Lord returned to his use of the word "the Son," and since the word "gave" is also employed to denote the stupendous conception, there is also involved in it the declaration that the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, seeing he is both Son of God and Son of man, is endowed with all the functions of both. In his incarnation he has not lost the infinite fulness of life giving power. "He quickeneth whom he will," having life in himself. His voice is the voice of the Son of God. The glory of the Word who became flesh was the glory of the Only Begotten. The part which this great passage took in the Arian controversy is well known (see Athanasius, 'Discourses against Arians,' 3:3, translated by J.H. Newman). Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the position that the Lord here speaks of "life in himself," which was given to the Son (God-Man) in virtue of, and as the reward of his sacrificial work. He points to <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, etc. But Jesus here speaks of a gift already made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
