In the ancient Near East, public recognition was often associated with honor and status. The brothers of Jesus, who spoke these words, were likely influenced by the prevailing cultural norms that valued public acknowledgment. This statement also highlights a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, which was not to seek earthly fame but to fulfill divine purposes. The idea of acting in secret contrasts with the public ministry of Jesus, who often withdrew to solitary places to pray (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>), emphasizing His focus on spiritual rather than worldly acclaim.<p><b>Since You are doing these things,</b><br>The "things" referred to here are the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which had already begun to attract attention throughout Judea and Galilee. His brothers recognized the significance of His works but failed to grasp their spiritual implications. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' actions are misunderstood by those closest to Him. The miracles served as signs pointing to His divine authority and messianic identity, as seen in <a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>, where His first miracle at Cana revealed His glory.<p><b>show Yourself to the world.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the expectation that the Messiah would reveal Himself to the world in a dramatic and unmistakable way. The brothers' suggestion for Jesus to show Himself aligns with the Jewish expectation of a political and military leader who would liberate Israel. However, Jesus' mission was to reveal the Kingdom of God through His teachings, death, and resurrection. The call to "show Yourself" also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of Jesus to the world through His crucifixion and resurrection, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the suffering servant. This statement reflects a limited understanding of Jesus' mission, which was not to gain worldly fame but to offer salvation to all humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of John, whose actions and teachings are being scrutinized by His brothers in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_brothers.htm">Jesus' Brothers</a></b><br>- They are urging Jesus to reveal Himself publicly, possibly out of disbelief or misunderstanding of His mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>- The region where Jesus' brothers suggest He should go to make His works known, specifically during the Feast of Tabernacles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>- A significant Jewish festival that commemorates the Israelites' wilderness journey, providing a backdrop for the events in <a href="/bsb/john/7.htm">John 7</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the Feast of Tabernacles is held, and where Jesus' brothers suggest He should demonstrate His works.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_motives.htm">Understanding True Motives</a></b><br>Jesus' brothers misunderstood His mission, focusing on public recognition rather than divine purpose.

So Luthardt: "It denotes that which is <span class="accented">open</span>, in contrast to that which is <span class="accented">concealed."</span> Westcott settles the meaning of the word by the remark that "the phrase (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is commonly used by the rabbinical writers for 'in public,' as opposed to 'in secret.'" The man who persists in quiet, secret ways of acting, and strenuously avoids publicity, is not the man who seeketh to be illustrious and conspicuous. The brethren see a palpable contradiction between the claims which Jesus is making and the comparative retirement to which he is confining himself. The crowds of the Galilaean lake are blank retirement when compared with the metropolis in the great climacteric festival of the year. The brethren call on Christ to solve the contradiction. It cannot be concealed that Jesus had (<a href="/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>; <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>) repeatedly said, "No man lighteth a lamp and putteth it under a bushel, but on a candlestick," etc.; and so the brothers use Christ's words against himself. But the Lord's idea of needful manifestation, both as to degree, time, and place, was accurately realized and represented in both narratives. <span class="cmt_word">If thou doest these things</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;</span> is simply the logical premise, without necessarily throwing doubt on the facts. It is not equal, however, to the particle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "since." Admitting these works to be real, and these mighty deeds to be correctly reported, there, is from the standpoint of the brethren no other course than that which they suggest: <span class="cmt_word">Manifest thyself to</span> <span class="cmt_word">the world;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "proceed to the widest arena at once;" "thou art compromising thyself by thy retirement;" "what thou art doing with one hand thou art undoing with the other." "All the Israel world from all lands is crowding to the great feast, thy disciples amongst them; make thyself known; claim the place that belongs to thee." It must be remembered that the disciples (Judas, not Iscariot, especially) said on the very night of the Passion, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?"
