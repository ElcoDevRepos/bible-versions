The "things" He refers to include the coming of the Holy Spirit, the world's hatred, and the disciples' future suffering. This is part of the Upper Room Discourse, where Jesus provides final teachings and comfort to His disciples before His crucifixion. The forewarning is meant to strengthen their faith and resolve.<p><b>so that when their hour comes,</b><br>"Their hour" refers to the time of persecution and trials that the disciples will face. This phrase indicates a specific, divinely appointed time for these events to occur. It echoes the concept of God's sovereignty over history and events, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven. Jesus' foreknowledge of these events underscores His divine nature and omniscience.<p><b>you will remember that I told you about them.</b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of remembering His words as a source of comfort and assurance. This act of remembrance is crucial for the disciples' faith, as it will help them understand that the trials they face are part of God's plan. This is similar to the role of remembrance in the Old Testament, where the Israelites are often called to remember God's past faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p><b>I did not tell you these things from the beginning,</b><br>Jesus acknowledges that He withheld certain information from the disciples earlier in His ministry. This suggests a progressive revelation, where God reveals His plans and purposes gradually as His people are ready to understand and bear them. This is consistent with the way God revealed His covenant promises throughout the Old Testament, such as with Abraham and Moses.<p><b>because I was with you.</b><br>While Jesus was physically present with the disciples, He provided direct guidance and protection. His presence meant that they did not need to know everything in advance. This reflects the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, akin to a shepherd with his sheep. It also foreshadows the coming of the Holy Spirit, who will continue to guide and comfort them after Jesus' ascension, as promised in <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the events that will follow His departure, including His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, they are being prepared for the trials and persecutions they will face after Jesus' departure.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_persecution.htm">The Coming Persecution</a></b><br>Jesus refers to the future challenges and persecutions the disciples will face, emphasizing the importance of His teachings and the Holy Spirit's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_trials.htm">Preparation for Trials</a></b><br>Jesus prepares His followers for future challenges, emphasizing the importance of His teachings and the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and comforting them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_memory_in_faith.htm">The Role of Memory in Faith</a></b><br>Remembering Jesus' words and promises is crucial for enduring trials.

When He shall have left them they will represent Him, and must stand in the foreground of the battle.<p>These words seem to be opposed to Matthew 10 and parallel passages, where our Lord did tell the Apostles at the time of their call of the persecutions which awaited them. (See especially <a href="/john/16-17.htm" title="Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?">John 16:17</a>; <a href="/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>; <a href="/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>.) The passages are not, however, really inconsistent, for "these things" in this verse (comp. <a href="/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>; <a href="/john/16-1.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, that you should not be offended.">John 16:1</a>, and <a href="/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>) refers to the full account He has given them of the world's hatred and the principles lying at the foot of it, and the manner in which it was to be met by the Spirit's witness and their witness of Him. These things which the infant Church would have to meet, and meet without His bodily presence, He told them not at the beginning. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> suggests a kind of pause, as if he had said, "I will go into no further details" (Meyer) - <span class="cmt_word">these things</span> - these prophecies of approaching persecution - <span class="cmt_word">I have spoken to you, that</span> (here <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> has its proper relic force) <span class="cmt_word">when</span> [<span class="cmt_word">their</span>] <span class="cmt_word">hour is come, ye may remember</span> [<span class="cmt_word">them</span>] <span class="cmt_word">how that I told you</span>. This awkward form is that due to the perplexities of the position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the text. Frequently our Lord thus prepared his disciples for the future, called upon them to remember his predictions as pledges of his Divine mission, but still more as consolations and supply of strength when they would most of all need it. <span class="cmt_word">These things I told you not from the beginning</span>; not "at the beginning," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;</span>, nor <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="/isaiah/40-21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>), from the beginning of my ministry (as <a href="/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>), and continuously throughout it. If "these things" are restricted to the prediction of cruel persecution, they are certainly contradicted by the language of <a href="/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17, 21, 28</a>; <a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>, etc.; Matthew 21:36; 24:9; <a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>, etc. The numerous explanations of the commentators, that Christ had now given a more detailed, particular, and tragic outlook, cannot be sustained. Nor does the supposition that John is here the corrector of the synoptic narrative satisfy (Meyer); nor that of Godet, that Matthew, in his tenth chapter, was gathering together all that Christ had said of this nature, antedating instructions that the Lord had given, at all explain the corresponding passages in Luke's Gospel. The language of the last clause, because <span class="cmt_word">I was with you</span>, throws more light upon it. This does not surely mean "because I was bearing for you the brunt of the opposition," - it would be unnecessary altogether to say that. All along <span class="accented">they</span> must have bitterly felt the antagonism which their Lord encountered. The difficulty is removed by including in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 4 what certainly is involved in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 1; and the reference is to the whole of his instructions touching his departure and the coming of the other Paraclete, and the principle from which the hatred of the world would spring; the explanation of the anticipated hostility which he had now offered, and the way in which they might overcome it.
