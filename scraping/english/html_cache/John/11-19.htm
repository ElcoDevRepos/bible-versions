In Jewish culture, mourning was a communal activity, and it was customary for friends and family to visit the bereaved to offer comfort. This reflects the close-knit nature of Jewish society at the time. The mention of "many of the Jews" suggests that Martha and Mary were well-known and respected within their community, possibly indicating their family's prominence or the impact of Lazarus's death. This gathering also sets the stage for the miracle of Lazarus's resurrection, as it ensures that there are many witnesses to the event, which would later spread the news of Jesus's power.<p><b>to console them</b><br>Consolation was an important aspect of Jewish mourning practices. The presence of others provided emotional support and helped the bereaved process their grief. This act of consolation is consistent with the Jewish practice of "sitting shiva," a period of seven days of mourning where friends and family visit the home of the deceased to offer comfort. The act of consoling also reflects the compassion and empathy expected within the community, aligning with biblical teachings on loving one's neighbor and bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>in the loss of their brother</b><br>The loss of Lazarus is central to this narrative, as it sets the stage for one of Jesus's most significant miracles. The death of a sibling would have been a profound loss, especially in a society where family ties were paramount. This phrase highlights the personal and emotional impact of death, which is a universal human experience. Theologically, Lazarus's death and subsequent resurrection serve as a foreshadowing of Jesus's own death and resurrection, illustrating His power over life and death and affirming His identity as the Son of God. This event also fulfills Jesus's earlier statement that the illness would not end in death but would glorify God (<a href="/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>Sister of Mary and Lazarus, known for her active service and hospitality.
