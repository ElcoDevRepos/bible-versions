This internal dialogue reflects their confusion and misunderstanding of Jesus' mission.<p><b>&#8220;Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him?</b><br>The Jews are puzzled by Jesus' statement about going somewhere they cannot follow.

This dispersion is significant in understanding the spread of early Christianity, as these communities often became initial audiences for the Gospel.<p><b>and teach the Greeks?</b><br>The mention of teaching the Greeks suggests a broader mission beyond the Jewish people, hinting at the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan.

Here, it signals the people&#8217;s transition from mere curiosity to anxious speculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jews said to one another</b><p>&#8226; Instead of seeking the Lord for clarity, they consult one another&#8212;a pattern of human reasoning that frequently misses divine truth (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, similar whispering among the crowd produced division about Jesus&#8217; identity (<a href="/john/7-32.htm">John 7:32, 43</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> reminds us to trust in the Lord rather than lean on our own understanding; their dialogue illustrates the danger of the latter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him?</b><p>&#8226; They assume Jesus plans a change of location, unaware He is speaking of a heavenly destination inaccessible without faith (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual blindness keeps them from recognizing the Messiah in front of them (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>; <a href="/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Their question underscores the futility of human effort to reach God apart from His revealed path (<a href="/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;dispersion&#8221; (diaspora) refers to Jews living outside Judea, scattered since the exiles (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, after His resurrection the gospel would indeed go to these scattered Jewish communities through the apostles (<a href="/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14-16</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their speculation unwittingly aligns with God&#8217;s plan to gather His people from afar (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and teach the Greeks?</b><p>&#8226; They wonder if Jesus might extend His ministry to Gentiles&#8212;an idea many first-century Jews found shocking (<a href="/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet prophecy had long promised light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; 49:6).<p>&#8226; Jesus later affirms, &#8220;I have other sheep that are not of this fold&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>) and indicates that Gentiles seeking Him signal the hour for His glorification (<a href="/john/12-20.htm">John 12:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and Paul&#8217;s testimony, &#8220;I will send you far away to the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>), show the fulfillment of the very possibility they voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a> captures a crowd grappling with Jesus&#8217; mysterious words. Their earthly reasoning leads to confused questions about geography, while Jesus speaks of heavenly realities and a worldwide mission. Unwittingly, they predict the gospel&#8217;s expansion to the scattered Jews and even to the Greeks. The verse thus highlights human misunderstanding, God&#8217;s sovereign plan to reach all peoples, and the necessity of faith to follow the Savior where human effort cannot go.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Whither will he go that we shall not find him?</span>--He had said in <a href="/john/7-33.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.">John 7:33</a>, "I go unto Him that sent Me," and in Joh 7:28. He had declared that they knew not Him that sent Him. There is, then, no contradiction between these verses, and their question, strange as it seems, is but another instance of their total want of power to read any meaning which does not lie upon the surface. He is going away, and they will not be able to find Him, and they can only think of distant lands where other Jews had gone, as of Babylon, or of Egypt, or of Greece.

The only other instance of its occurrence in the Bible, is in the Greek version (LXX.) of <a href="/psalms/146-2.htm" title="While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.">Psalm 146:2</a>. (In Authorised version, <a href="/psalms/147-2.htm" title="The LORD does build up Jerusalem: he gathers together the outcasts of Israel.">Psalm 147:2</a>, "He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.") It is also found in <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-27.htm" title="Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.">2 Maccabees 1:27</a>, "Gather those together that are scattered from us." (Comp. Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> vii. 3, ? 3; <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xii. 1-3; 15:3, ? 1.) The abstract word is used like "the circumcision," <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as a comprehensive title for the individuals included in it. These were the Jews who did not dwell within the limits of the Holy Land, but spreading from the three chief centres, Babylonia, Egypt, and Syria, were found in every part of the civilised world. The Babylonian Diaspora owed its origin to the vast number of exiles who preferred to remain in the positions they had acquired for themselves in their new homes, and did not return to Palestine after the Captivity. They were by far the greater part of the nation, and were scattered through the whole extent of the Persian empire. Of the origin of the Egyptian Diaspora, we find traces in the Old Testament, as in <a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/42-18.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt: and you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.">Jeremiah 42:18</a>. Their numbers were greatly increased under Alexander the Great and his successors, so that they extended over the whole country (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvi. 7, ?2). Much less numerous than their brethren of Babylonia, and regarded as less pure in descent, they have, through their contact with Western thought and the Greek language, left a deeper and wider influence on after ages. To them we owe the LXX. translation of the Old Testament Scriptures, and the Alexandrian school of Jewish philosophers, two of the most important influences which first prepared the way for, and afterwards moulded the forms of, Christianity. The Syrian Diaspora is traced by Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> vii. 3, ? 1) to the conquests of Seleucus Nicator (B.C. 300). Under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, they spread over a wider area, including the whole of Asia Minor, and thence to the islands and mainland of Greece. It was less numerous than either that of Babylonia or that of Egypt, but the synagogues of this Diaspora formed the connecting links between the older and the newer revelation, and were the first buildings in which Jesus was preached as the Messiah. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this</span> <span class="cmt_word">Man go,</span> <span class="cmt_word">that we shall not find him?</span> With their murderous designs they are blinded even to the meaning of his words.
