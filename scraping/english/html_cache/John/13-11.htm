This foreknowledge is consistent with Jesus' understanding of human hearts, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. The betrayal by Judas was prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend lifting his heel against the psalmist, a type of Christ. Judas' role as the betrayer fulfills this prophecy, demonstrating the sovereignty of God in the unfolding of redemptive history. The knowledge of betrayal also underscores the depth of Jesus' love and grace, as He continued to serve and love Judas despite knowing his intentions.<p><b>That is why He said,</b><br>This phrase refers back to Jesus' earlier statement in <a href="/john/13-10.htm">John 13:10</a>, where He mentions that not all of the disciples are clean. It serves as an explanation for His words, providing insight into His awareness of the spiritual state of His disciples. This moment occurs during the Last Supper, a significant event in the Passion narrative, where Jesus institutes the practice of communion and demonstrates servanthood by washing the disciples' feet. The setting is Jerusalem, a city rich in biblical history and the center of Jewish religious life, adding gravity to the events unfolding.<p><b>&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus distinguishes between the physical act of washing and the spiritual cleansing that comes through faith in Him. While the disciples had their feet washed, symbolizing purification and humility, Jesus indicates that one among them, Judas, remains spiritually unclean due to his lack of genuine faith and impending betrayal. This statement foreshadows the separation between true believers and those who merely appear to follow Christ, a theme echoed in parables like the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>). The concept of cleanliness is deeply rooted in Jewish law and tradition, where ritual purity was essential for worship and community life, yet Jesus redefines it in terms of inner spiritual purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is aware of the impending betrayal by one of His disciples.

Earlier, &#8220;Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>). Just as He could tell the Samaritan woman her past (<a href="/john/4-17.htm">John 4:17-18</a>) and foresee Peter&#8217;s denial (<a href="/john/13-38.htm">John 13:38</a>), He now looks straight through the upper-room candlelight into Judas&#8217;s dark intention. Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we take &#8220;He knew&#8221; as absolute&#8212;Jesus was never surprised. That certainty underscores His sovereignty and reassures believers that nothing happens outside His control (cf. <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who would betray Him</b><p>The word &#8220;betray&#8221; recalls <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>: &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230;has lifted up his heel against me,&#8221; a verse Jesus quotes moments later (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>).

The scene highlights amazing grace: Christ serves the very one selling Him out, paralleling <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is why He said</b><p>Jesus&#8217; statement flows directly from His knowledge. Back in <a href="/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64</a>, He had already hinted, &#8220;There are some of you who do not believe.&#8221; Now the earlier warning becomes explicit. Every word Jesus utters carries intentional purpose (cf. <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). He speaks not to embarrass the disciples but to prepare them, so their faith won&#8217;t collapse when Judas&#8217;s treachery unfolds (<a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Not all of you are clean.&#8221;</b><p>Just minutes earlier, Jesus told Peter, &#8220;A person who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean.

That is why He said, &#8216;Not all of you are clean.&#8217;&#8221; The verse comforts believers with Christ&#8217;s absolute control, warns us that genuine faith goes deeper than outward association, and invites self-examination to ensure we are truly &#8220;clean&#8221; through trusting the Savior who loves and serves, even in the face of betrayal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">For he knew who should betray him.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2</a>, and Note on <a href="/matthew/26-48.htm" title="Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.">Matthew 26:48</a>. This is the first reference to the betrayal during the feast. The words are words of warning, spoken in the love which even then might have redeemed and cleansed the heart, if it had been open to receive it. The feet of Judas were washed by his Master. Had he learnt the lesson of humility and love, he might have conquered the foul spirit of ambition and covetousness which was carrying him to destruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he knew who was betraying him; therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.</span> That Christ should have been ignorant of the devices of Judas, or of his true character, is repeatedly denied by all the evangelists. John certainly calls attention to the Lord's knowledge of the secret of Judas, and justifies thus his Divine prerogative. That Strauss, Hilgenfeld, and others should see here an innuendo against Peter, and the charge against Peter of advocating a kind of Ebionitie daily ablution of the whole body, is willful and uncalled for. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
