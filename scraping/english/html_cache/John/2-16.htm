The sellers of doves were likely exploiting the poor by charging exorbitant prices. Jesus addressing them directly highlights His concern for justice and righteousness, especially for the marginalized. This act also fulfills the prophetic role of the Messiah as one who purifies and restores true worship (<a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1-3</a>).<p><b>Get these out of here!</b><br>This command demonstrates Jesus' authority over the Temple, which was the center of Jewish religious life. His actions echo the prophetic tradition of cleansing and reforming religious practices (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-11</a>). The forceful removal of the merchants signifies a rejection of the commercialization of sacred spaces, emphasizing the need for purity in worship.<p><b>How dare you turn My Father&#8217;s house</b><br>By referring to the Temple as "My Father&#8217;s house," Jesus asserts His unique relationship with God, implying His divine sonship. This phrase connects to the broader theme of Jesus' identity as the Son of God, a central tenet of Christian belief (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). The Temple, as God's dwelling place, was meant to be a house of prayer (<a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>), not a place of commerce.<p><b>into a marketplace!</b><br>The transformation of the Temple into a marketplace symbolizes the corruption and spiritual decay present in the religious leadership of the time. This critique aligns with the prophetic tradition of condemning empty rituals and the exploitation of religious practices for personal gain (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>).

What that repeated claim meant now must have been clear to all. Their own messengers had brought them John's witness; later reports must have come before, and come with, the crowd of Galilaean pilgrims; the disciples are themselves with Him (<a href="/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a>), and their hearts are too full for silence; but there was more than all this. Those expounders of the oracles of God who remembered that Elijah was to come before the day of the Lord, must have remembered, too, that the Lord was to come to this Temple, like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap (<a href="/context/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>). That fire was in their midst, and from that Presence buyers and sellers and changers shrunk back in awe, none daring to resist; that cleansing was then taking place, and the Son was claiming the sanctity and reverence due to His Father's house. He has before claimed to be Son of Man. The Messianic title is publicly claimed before the official representatives of the people at the great national festival, in the Temple, at Jerusalem. If, while this scene is fresh is our minds, we think again of the marriage at Cana, we shall feel how different the manifestations are, and that this latter was not, and was not intended to be, a public declaration of His person and work. Now we understand what seemed hard before, that the assertion "Mine hour is not yet come" (<a href="/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>) immediately precedes the first sign. This sign was at a family gathering known only to few, probably not to all who were there, for "the ruler knew not whence it was" (<a href="/john/2-9.htm" title="When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,">John 2:9</a>), and no effect is described as resulting from it, except that the little band of disciples believed (<a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>). The "forth," which in the English version seems to mark an effect upon others, is not found in the Greek. It is within the circle of the other Gospel narratives, but is included in none of them. It left no such impression in the mind of St. Peter as to lead him to include it in the Gospel of his interpreter, St. Mark, or upon Mary herself as to lead her to include it in the answers she must have given to the questions of St. Luke. It was, indeed, the first sign in Cana of Galilee, but the scene before us is the announcement to the world. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said to those that sold the doves.</span> The vendors of tethered or caged birds were as guilty of profanation as the rest. Some sentimental comments have gathered round this verse, as though the Lord were more tender in his treatment of the turtle doves than in that of the oxen or sheep. But there would be no meaning in such a distinction. No other way of scattering the doves was so simple as to command their removal. At "the Ammergan Passion play," the doves are let loose, fly away over the heads of the audience, and disappear. The lifting of the scourge, accompanied, doubtless, with words of solemn warning and command, said in effect what he now put into words. <span class="cmt_word">Take these things hence. Make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise</span>. In this act our Lord simply assumed the <span class="accented">role</span> of any and every Hebrew prophet. The Talmud enjoins the sanctity for which the Saviour pleads. He called the temple "my Father's house" (cf. <a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>), and therefore claims especially to be the Son of God Most High. The Eternal, the Holy One of Israel, stands in this mysterious relationship to him. He does not say, "our Father's house." When, however, alter the second cleansing of the temple, he spake of the temple, from which he finally withdrew (<a href="/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>), he called it by no other name than "your house," "left unto you desolate." Moreover, on that subsequent occasion, he used, in place of "house of merchandise," the bitter description, "den of robbers" (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>). This first act was reformatory of a gross abuse; the latter was judicial and condemnatory (see Hengstenberg, 'Christology' and 'Comm.,' <a href="/zechariah/14-21.htm">Zechariah 14:21</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-11.htm">Zephaniah 1:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). Archdeacon Watkins has wisely called attention to the contrast between this scene and sign and that given at Cana.
