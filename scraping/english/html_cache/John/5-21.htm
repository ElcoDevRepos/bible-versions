Instances of God raising the dead can be seen in the stories of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-37</a>). The power to give life is a divine attribute, underscoring God's sovereignty over life and death. This sets the stage for understanding the nature of Jesus' ministry and His divine authority.<p><b>so also the Son gives life</b><br>Here, the text draws a parallel between the Father and the Son, indicating that Jesus possesses the same life-giving power as God. This is a profound statement of Jesus' divinity and equality with the Father. In the context of the Gospel of John, this aligns with the prologue (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-4</a>), where Jesus is described as the Word through whom all things were made, and in Him was life. This life-giving ability is not just physical but also spiritual, as seen in Jesus' teachings about eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>to whom He wishes</b><br>This phrase highlights the sovereign will of Jesus in dispensing life. It suggests that Jesus has the authority to choose whom to grant life, reflecting His divine prerogative. This is consistent with the theme of divine election found throughout Scripture, where God chooses individuals for specific purposes (<a href="/romans/9-15.htm">Romans 9:15-16</a>). It also points to the personal relationship Jesus has with those who believe in Him, as He calls them by name and grants them eternal life (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, who has the power to raise the dead and give life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, who shares in the divine authority to give life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Represents those who are physically dead, as well as those who are spiritually dead in sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/life.htm">Life</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to both physical resurrection and spiritual life, which Jesus imparts to believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_resurrection.htm">The Event of Resurrection</a></b><br>The act of raising the dead, which is a divine prerogative shared by both the Father and the Son.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_jesus.htm">Divine Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus shares in the divine authority of the Father, affirming His deity and His role in the Godhead.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_resurrection.htm">Spiritual Resurrection</a></b><br>Just as Jesus has the power to physically raise the dead, He also has the power to bring spiritual life to those who are dead in sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_eternal_life.htm">Assurance of Eternal Life</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in the promise of eternal life through Jesus, who has the authority to grant it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_faith.htm">Call to Faith</a></b><br>Understanding Jesus' authority should lead us to trust Him fully for our salvation and eternal destiny.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_newness_of_life.htm">Living in Newness of Life</a></b><br>As recipients of spiritual life, we are called to live in a way that reflects the transformative power of Christ in us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_21_Jesus_power_over_life_death.htm">How does John 5:21 demonstrate Jesus' divine authority over life and death?

"He bringeth down to the underworld and bringeth up" (<a href="/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.">1Samuel 2:6</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/13-2.htm" title="For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.">Tobit 13:2</a>).

These the Son seeth the Father doing, and these also He doeth in like manner. He, too, has the power to quicken whom He will, and He useth that power. Deadened souls have felt it, and are living in the new-born life. There is in His word, for the man who hears it and believes it, a moral change which is nothing other than an actual passing out of death into life (<a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-26.</span> - <span class="accented">Greater works: <p><span class="note_emph"></span>(1)</span> <span class="accented">the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> introduces an illustration, a proof of the previous assertion. viz. that the eternal love of the Son would issue in such new marvels) <span class="cmt_word">as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span> This is the most exhaustive expression of the Father's love and revelation to the Son. This thing the Son sees, and this same thing he will do, whether these Jews attempt to put any arrest upon his will or not. The majority of commentators regard vers. 21-27 as descriptive of the moral and spiritual resurrection of dead souls, and hold that a transition is made in vers. 28, 29 to the resurrection of dead bodies and the final consummation. There are some, however, who regard the whole passage - even vers. 28, 29 - as referring, with the previous verses, to <span class="accented">moral</span> resurrection, although the words, "in their tombs" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are there added to give distinctness and explicitness to that future resurrection; and though "now is" of ver. 25 is not there predicated or repeated. Others (with many of the older expositors) refer the entire passage to the <span class="accented">final</span> resurrection, which, however, is incompatible with ver. 20 and with the "now <span class="accented">is"</span> of ver. 25. Others, again, see in ver. 21, in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>,, the whole process of resurrection and renewal, both physical and moral, bodily and spiritual. They suppose that in ver. 25 Christ refers first to the spiritual renovation, to be affirmed and consummated in the universal resurrection and judgment of the last day. The generality of the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, attributed to the Father, makes it possible that the Lord was referring to the numerous events of uplifting from the pit, from the lowest <span class="accented">sheol</span>, which formed the staple religious nutrition of the Jewish race. The history of Divine revelation is one lengthened series of interpositions and deliverances, of resurrections of the people of Israel, and of the theocracy from bondage, exile, and spiritual and civil death, and of references to the wonderful transformations of saints and prophets and kings from the depths of despair to the light of life and Divine favour. Ezekiel (37) had likened the most memorable of these resurrections to the uprising of a huge army from a valley of vision, strown with the dry bones of both houses of Israel. "So also," says Jesus, "the Son quiekeneth." including under this term, it may be, the physical healing which is often the precursor and condition of spiritual awakening and moral health and vigour. The Son, the incarnate Logos, revealing himself on earth, both as Logos and Son of man, <span class="accented">is now quickening after the same fashion whom he will.</span> The will of Christ is in such entire harmony with the Father's will that there is no rivalry here. The will of the Son is in spontaneous accord with the Divine purpose of resurrection and quickening. He is already doing thus here on earth, as the great organ of the Father, that which makes his will the revelation of the Father. There is no arbitrary decree, such as Calvin found here, nor such as Roues insists upon. The emphasis is simply upon the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; and we have in the expression a vindication of the nineteenth verse, "The Son doeth that which he sees the Father doing." His own <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being the origin and revealed centre on earth of Divine manifestations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
