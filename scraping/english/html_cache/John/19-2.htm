Thorns, a symbol of the curse from <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, represent sin and the fallen world. The soldiers' act of twisting a crown of thorns signifies the mockery of Jesus' claim to kingship, as thorns were not only painful but also a parody of a royal crown. This act fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who was "despised and rejected by men." The crown of thorns also symbolizes Jesus bearing the curse of sin on behalf of humanity.<p><b>set it on His head</b><br>Placing the crown on Jesus' head was an act of humiliation and physical torment. The head, being the most sensitive part of the body, would have caused intense pain. This act of setting the crown on His head is reminiscent of the anointing of kings in the Old Testament, but here it is done in derision. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who, despite this mockery, is the true King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>and dressed Him in a purple robe</b><br>Purple, a color associated with royalty and wealth, was used here to mock Jesus' claim to be the King of the Jews. The robe, likely a faded military cloak, was used to ridicule His kingship. This act of dressing Him in a purple robe is a stark contrast to the true majesty and glory of Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13-16</a>, where He is depicted in His divine splendor. The mockery of the robe also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>, where the garments of the suffering servant are divided and cast lots upon.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_soldiers.htm">The Soldiers</a></b><br>Roman soldiers who were responsible for mocking and torturing Jesus before His crucifixion.

The "gorgeous robe" which had been put upon Jesus by Herod had been probably taken' from him before he was brought the second time into the Praetorium, and necessarily before his scourging. Now, though it is called a "purple robe" by John, it was probably a cast-off toga of the Herodian court, in all likelihood it was the same garment which was thrown again around his fettered limbs, his bowed and bleeding form. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns; in imitation of the victor's wreath at a "triumph," rather than the coronet or diadem of a king. The material is believed by Winer, Hug, Luthardt, and Godet to be the Lycium spinosum, often found at Jerusalem, not the acanthus, whose leaves decorate our Corinthian columns. It is of flexible stem, and would be soon woven into a wreath, the spikes of which, when it was placed around that majestic head, would be driven into the flesh, and produce great agony. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
