The context is crucial here, as Jesus had just explained the necessity of eating His flesh and drinking His blood to have eternal life, which was a challenging concept for His audience. This teaching followed the miraculous feeding of the 5,000, which set the stage for deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>many of His disciples said,</b><br>The term "disciples" here includes not only the Twelve Apostles but also a broader group of followers who had been attracted to Jesus' ministry. This indicates that the teaching was not just difficult for outsiders or casual listeners but even for those who had been following Him closely. It highlights the distinction between true discipleship and superficial following.<p><b>&#8220;This is a difficult teaching.</b><br>The word "difficult" suggests that the teaching was hard to understand or accept, not necessarily because of its complexity, but because it challenged existing beliefs and expectations. In the Jewish context, the idea of consuming blood was particularly offensive due to dietary laws (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>). This teaching required a shift from a literal to a spiritual understanding, which was a significant hurdle for many.<p><b>Who can accept it?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the struggle to embrace Jesus' message. It reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus' teachings often separate true believers from those who are not fully committed. The question implies a sense of disbelief and resistance, which is a common human reaction to divine revelation that challenges personal or cultural norms. This moment foreshadows the eventual departure of some disciples, emphasizing the cost of true discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, delivering teachings that challenge His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>A group of Jesus' followers who are struggling to understand and accept His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered the Bread of Life discourse, which precedes this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_of_life_discourse.htm">Bread of Life Discourse</a></b><br>The teaching that Jesus is the Bread of Life, which is the context for the disciples' reaction in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Includes both committed disciples and others who are following Jesus, some of whom find His teachings hard to accept.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_difficult_teachings.htm">Understanding Difficult Teachings</a></b><br>Jesus' teachings often challenge our human understanding and require spiritual discernment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faith.htm">The Role of Faith</a></b><br>Accepting difficult teachings requires faith and trust in Jesus, even when we do not fully understand.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_maturity.htm">Spiritual Maturity</a></b><br>Growth in spiritual maturity helps us to comprehend and accept deeper truths of the faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may involve grappling with hard teachings and making sacrifices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_the_holy_spirit.htm">Dependence on the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit aids in understanding and accepting the truths of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_6_60_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 6:60?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_grasp_Jesus_tough_teachings.htm">How can we better understand Jesus' teachings when they seem "hard" to accept?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_not_be_offended_by_tough_teachings.htm">What steps can we take to avoid being "offended" by difficult teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_6_60_to_Hebrews_11_s_faith_call.htm">How does John 6:60 connect with the call to faith in Hebrews 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_boost_faith_amid_tough_doctrines.htm">In what ways can we strengthen our faith when facing challenging doctrines?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Help_others_with_John_6_60_struggles.htm">How can we support others struggling with difficult teachings in John 6:60?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_John_6_60_hard_to_accept.htm">Why did many disciples find Jesus' teaching in John 6:60 difficult to accept?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_6_60_s_impact_on_Jesus_role.htm">How does John 6:60 challenge the understanding of Jesus' identity and mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_explains_John_6_60_s_reaction.htm">What historical context helps explain the reaction in John 6:60?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_didn't_jesus_write_anything.htm">Why didn't Jesus write anything Himself?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_functional_equivalence_translation.htm">Why did Jesus select Judas Iscariot as a disciple?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_say_to_eat_his_flesh.htm">Why did Jesus instruct eating His flesh and blood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_'famine_of_hearing'.htm">What does "Famine of Hearing the Words of the Lord" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 6:60 Mean</div><b>On hearing it</b><p>The crowd had just listened to Jesus declare, &#8220;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you&#8221;

It does not mean "hard to be understood," but difficult to accept or be content with. Luthardt here reiterates his conviction that there is no reference in it to the death of Christ, and that the disciples were simply unwilling to accept the idea of his supreme claims and his constant return to the. eating and drinking of his flesh and blood and identification of this eternal life with participation in his corporality. But surely Meyer and Wcstcott, etc., are far nearer to the truth in referring the expression to their unwillingness to accept the bloody death of their Messiah, or to entrust themselves to a Divine Personality whose most distinctive act would be his sacrifice. This was the gross and terrible offence which made the cross a stumbling block to the Jew (see <a href="/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2</a>l, etc.).
