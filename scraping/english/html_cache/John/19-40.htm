Joseph was a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin and a secret disciple of Jesus, while Nicodemus was a Pharisee who had previously visited Jesus at night. Their involvement fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which states that the Messiah would be with a rich man in His death. The act of taking Jesus' body signifies their courage and devotion, as they risked their reputations and possibly their positions to honor Him.<p><b>and wrapped it in linen cloths</b><br>The use of linen cloths for burial was a common Jewish practice, signifying respect and care for the deceased. Linen, a fine and costly fabric, was often used for the burial of the wealthy or honored individuals, which aligns with the prophecy of Jesus being buried with the rich. This act also prefigures the resurrection, as the linen cloths are later found in the empty tomb, symbolizing Jesus' victory over death.<p><b>with the spices</b><br>Spices were used in Jewish burial customs to anoint the body and mask the odor of decay. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds, which was an extravagant amount, indicating the high regard in which they held Jesus. This act of anointing with spices is reminiscent of the anointing of kings and foreshadows Jesus' role as the King of Kings. It also connects to the earlier anointing by Mary of Bethany, who anointed Jesus' feet with costly perfume, preparing Him for burial.<p><b>according to the Jewish burial custom</b><br>Jewish burial customs were rooted in the Torah and emphasized the dignity of the deceased. The body was to be buried as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours, to honor the dead and comply with Deuteronomic law. The preparation of Jesus' body according to these customs highlights the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in His life and death. It also underscores the humanity of Jesus, who experienced death and burial like any other human, yet His resurrection would transcend these customs, pointing to the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the Christian faith, whose crucifixion and burial are described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_of_arimathea.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a></b><br>A secret disciple of Jesus who, along with Nicodemus, took responsibility for Jesus' burial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council who previously visited Jesus at night and now assists in His burial.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_burial_custom.htm">Jewish Burial Custom</a></b><br>The traditional method of preparing a body for burial, involving wrapping in linen and using spices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tomb.htm">Tomb</a></b><br>The place where Jesus' body was laid, fulfilling prophecies about His burial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_body.htm">Respect for the Body</a></b><br>The care taken in Jesus' burial reflects the value and respect for the human body, even in death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' burial in a rich man's tomb fulfills specific Old Testament prophecies, affirming the reliability of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_faith.htm">Courage in Faith</a></b><br>Joseph and Nicodemus demonstrate courage by publicly associating with Jesus, challenging us to live boldly for our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_in_grief.htm">Community in Grief</a></b><br>The involvement of multiple people in Jesus' burial highlights the importance of community support in times of loss.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_resurrection.htm">Preparation for Resurrection</a></b><br>The burial sets the stage for the resurrection, reminding us that God&#8217;s plans often unfold beyond our immediate understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_19_40_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 19:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_19_40_and_Jewish_burial_customs.htm">How does John 19:40 demonstrate the fulfillment of Jewish burial customs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Spices_linen_s_role_in_John_19_40.htm">What significance does the use of spices and linen hold in John 19:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_19_40_to_OT_burial_customs.htm">How does John 19:40 connect to Old Testament burial practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_honor_Christ_daily_2.htm">How can we honor Christ's sacrifice in our daily lives, as seen here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_body_respect_in_John_19_40.htm">What does the burial preparation in John 19:40 teach about respect for the body?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_19_40_and_1st-century_Jewish_burial.htm">How does John 19:40 confirm the burial customs of first-century Jewish culture?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Spices_role_in_Jesus_burial.htm">What significance does the use of spices in John 19:40 hold for Jesus' burial?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Nicodemus_role_in_John_19_40_key.htm">Why is the involvement of Nicodemus in John 19:40 important for understanding Jesus' burial?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/was_jesus_wrapped_in_spices_or_just_linen.htm">Was Jesus' body wrapped in spices before burial, or was he simply wrapped in linen with spices prepared later by women?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_women_visit_jesus'_tomb.htm">Why did the women visit the tomb?

Their courage answers their earlier silence and shows God&#8217;s providence in providing honorable caretakers for His Son.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the reality of Jesus&#8217; physical death&#8212;He was not merely unconscious. Pilate confirmed the death (<a href="/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>), and the soldiers had pierced His side (<a href="/john/19-33.htm">John 19:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; By removing the body before nightfall they obeyed <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, keeping the land from ceremonial defilement and fulfilling Scripture that even in death Jesus remained under God&#8217;s law (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a> foretold that the Suffering Servant would be assigned a grave &#8220;with a rich man.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s actions make that prophecy concrete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wrapped it in linen cloths</b><p>&#8226; Joseph purchased &#8220;a linen cloth&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-46.htm">Mark 15:46</a>) and, with Nicodemus, wound the body in strips&#8212;an act of reverence normally performed by family or close friends (<a href="/luke/23-53.htm">Luke 23:53</a>).<p>&#8226; Linen points to purity (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The spotless Lamb is laid to rest in clean fabric, visually affirming His sinlessness (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The careful wrapping refutes later rumors that disciples stole the body; the grave-clothes were found undisturbed (<a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; At Jesus&#8217; birth He was wrapped in swaddling cloths (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>).

Such a lavish amount signals deep honor, more fitting for a king than a criminal (cf. <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a> where myrrh is a royal gift).<p>&#8226; Spices slowed decay and masked odor (<a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>).

It would seem probable, from what is afterwards said, that John wished to discriminate and affirm both processes (see <a href="/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>). The Jews' method differed from the Egyptians' embalming process. The latter removed all the viscera; and, by long baking and other processes, rendered the remaining shell of the corpse incorruptible and almost imperishable. The Jews' process of sepulture differed from the Roman cremation, and is emphasized. Importance was attached to a splendid funeral (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>); and this costly interment was not without its deep significance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
