His name, of Greek origin, means "victory of the people." He is mentioned only in the Gospel of John, indicating his unique role in the narrative. As a Pharisee, Nicodemus would have been well-versed in the Hebrew Scriptures and Jewish law, which is significant in understanding his interactions with Jesus.<p><b>who had gone to Jesus earlier</b><br>This refers to an earlier encounter in <a href="/john/3.htm">John 3</a>, where Nicodemus visits Jesus at night. This nighttime visit suggests a desire for privacy, possibly due to fear of being seen with Jesus, who was controversial among the Jewish leaders. During this meeting, Jesus speaks to Nicodemus about being "born again," introducing the concept of spiritual rebirth. This earlier interaction sets the stage for Nicodemus's developing understanding and eventual defense of Jesus.<p><b>and who himself was one of them</b><br>Nicodemus is identified as one of the Jewish leaders, specifically a member of the Sanhedrin. This council was the highest Jewish authority in religious and legal matters. His position indicates that he had significant influence and was part of the group that often opposed Jesus. However, his actions in this passage show a willingness to question the prevailing attitudes of his peers.<p><b>asked</b><br>Nicodemus's questioning nature is consistent with his earlier encounter with Jesus. His willingness to ask questions reflects a search for truth and understanding, which is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. This moment is significant as it shows Nicodemus beginning to publicly challenge the actions of his fellow leaders, indicating a shift in his perspective and a growing boldness in his faith journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council, the Sanhedrin.

He did not go far, but he directed attention to a fundamental principle of that very "Law" which the Pharisaic party were ignoring. <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus saith to them (he who came</span> to him <span class="cmt_word">formerly,</span> although <span class="cmt_word">being one</span> of them). The parenthesis shows the author's strong recollection of the scene (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>, etc.), when the Lord had opened to his own mind, as well as to Nicodemus, the mystery of the kingdom, and the need of that very Spirit's power to which (John knew when he wrote that) the Lord was referring in his great discourse. Nicodemus had not proclaimed his own discipleship, but he meant to cover and shield the enthusiastic crowd from the sting of the cruel condemnation of this Pharisaic junta. <span class="cmt_word">Doth our Law judge</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">man</span> <span class="cmt_word">except it have first heard from himself, and have come to know what he doeth?</span> (<a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a> margin, "Thou shalt not receive a false report;" <a href="/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>, "Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother"). The Law is here personified in the person of the judge. The process is not followed by this hasty <span class="accented">ex parte</span> statement. The Law is traversed by this forgetfulness of the first principle of justice as between man and man. They might have rejoined that they <span class="accented">did</span> know the teaching and the work of Jesus. They had been following him by their representatives, and were now witnesses of his extraordinary assumptions, and had evidence enough on which to proceed. The retort which they made is sufficient proof of the defective and passion-blinded method of their own procedure. Moreover, it shows that the prophetic rank assigned to the Lord Jesus was the main question in the mind of Nicodemus and his Pharisaic companions. The rules for the judgment of a prophet were stringent, and no attempt had been made to put these prophetic claims to the test (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19-22</a>). Moreover, they ran off upon an utterly false tack, and were not free from inaccuracy in their solemn appeal to Holy Scripture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Nicodemus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Nikod&#275;mos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3530.htm">Strong's 3530: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nicodemus, a member of the Sanhedrin.
