In the context of Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman, the "reaper" symbolizes those who are actively involved in the work of evangelism and discipleship. The "wages" refer to the spiritual rewards and fulfillment that come from participating in God's work. This echoes the principle found in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>, where Paul speaks of each worker receiving their reward according to their labor. The imagery of reaping suggests a time of joy and completion, as seen in the agricultural practices of the time, where harvest was a season of celebration.<p><b>and gathers a crop for eternal life</b><br>The "crop" represents the souls brought to faith in Christ, emphasizing the eternal significance of evangelistic work. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8</a>, where sowing to please the Spirit results in eternal life. The focus on "eternal life" underscores the ultimate goal of the Gospel, which is not merely temporal improvement but everlasting communion with God. This phrase also reflects the eschatological hope present throughout the New Testament, where the harvest is often associated with the end times and the final gathering of believers.<p><b>so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together</b><br>This part highlights the unity and shared joy in the work of God's kingdom. The "sower" and "reaper" represent different roles within the process of evangelism and spiritual growth, yet both are essential and interconnected. This unity is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>, where Paul describes the collaborative nature of ministry. The shared rejoicing points to the communal aspect of the Christian faith, where all believers participate in and celebrate the work of God. It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13</a>, where the plowman overtakes the reaper, symbolizing abundant blessing and harmony.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of John, who is teaching about spiritual truths using the metaphor of sowing and reaping.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His interactions with others.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, she is part of the broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, where Jesus speaks to her at the well.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The region where Jesus is speaking, significant for its mixed population and historical tensions with the Jews.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_harvest.htm">The Harvest</a></b><br>A metaphorical event representing the gathering of believers into eternal life, emphasizing the spiritual work of evangelism.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_collaboration_in_ministry.htm">The Joy of Collaboration in Ministry</a></b><br>The verse highlights the joy that comes when both the sower and the reaper work together in God's kingdom.

The sower is Christ Himself, whose words have been the seed in the woman's heart, already bringing forth a harvest in those who are coming to Him. The reapers are the disciples. In this harvest day they would learn, from sympathy with the souls of others, the joy of the reaper, and in that joy it was ordained that sower and reaper should rejoice together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - Then partially dropping, or rather explaining, his metaphorical language, he added, <span class="cmt_word">Already he that reapeth receiveth wages;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> receiveth from the great Owner of all souls the reward of fellowship with his purpose, and the recompense of entering into the supreme joy of the Lord of the harvest. The disciples might at once enter upon their harvesting. The work was itself "payment," but it has a distinct aim beyond mere <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> - be who reaps in this harvest of souls <span class="cmt_word">is gathering in fruit unto eternal life.</span> The water that Jesus gives, the refreshment of soul be is able to supply, becomes a well, a fountain, a river, an ocean of life, an eternity of blessedness; and now this fruit of souls, this harvest of saved men, is a Divine, eternal treasure, which the reaper houses in the garner of God. The final clause is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which certainly suggests here the "contemplated result" rather than the end of this ingathering. The "end" would be greater and nobler than what is here mentioned; the result is <span class="cmt_word">that even the sower and also the reaper may rejoice together.</span> Westcott here says that Christ does not speak of himself as "the Sower," but as "the Lord of the harvest." If it be so, the sowers of whom be thinks are all the preparatory processes, all the prophetic men, all the testifiers to the Light whose testimony was crowned in John, all the way by which Judaea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth have been prepared for the kingdom of the Spirit; and they will all rejoice together with yourselves who now begin your harvest joy. If so, the vista opens first into the long future of Christian enterprise, to be consummated at last in the heavenly world, where parted hands may meet again, and these who have never met before shall "clasp inseparable hands in joy and bliss in overmeasure forever!" All this may be proleptically contained in the words, but the special force of them would be severed from the circumstances which manifestly gave birth to them. These seem to me to be, primarily, Christ's own ministry of sowing on that very day. The reaping of the harvest may begin at once, and so the Sower (the Son of God) and reapers who gather fruit unto life eternal may and will rejoice together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Already} the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
