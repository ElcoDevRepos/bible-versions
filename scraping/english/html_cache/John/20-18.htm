Her role highlights the significant place women held in Jesus' ministry, despite the cultural norms of the time that often marginalized them. The act of announcing the resurrection to the disciples underscores her importance as a witness. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier promise that He would rise again, and it sets the stage for the Great Commission, where the disciples are sent to proclaim the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>&#8220;I have seen the Lord!&#8221;</b><br>Mary's declaration is a profound statement of faith and a pivotal moment in Christian history. Her encounter with the risen Christ transforms her grief into joy and certainty. This phrase echoes the personal and transformative nature of encountering Jesus, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. It also serves as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>, where He assures His followers that their sorrow will turn to joy. Her testimony is a precursor to the apostolic witness that forms the foundation of the early church.<p><b>And she told them what He had said to her.</b><br>Mary's recounting of Jesus' words emphasizes the importance of the message she received. Jesus' instructions to Mary, as recorded earlier in the chapter, include the command to inform the disciples of His impending ascension. This highlights the continuity of Jesus' mission and the preparation of His followers for the coming of the Holy Spirit. Her role as a messenger parallels the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, where individuals are chosen to deliver God's word to His people. This moment also prefigures the role of the disciples as bearers of the Gospel message to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is the first to witness the resurrected Christ.

She rushes at once with speed and zeal, and the word is on her tongue, <span class="cmt_word">I have seen</span> (she does not say, I have grasped him by the hand, or kissed his feet) <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="accented">how<span class="cmt_word"></span> that he said these things to her.</span> This special message, not recorded in <a href="/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>, was clearly not given to the women who held his feet. Some harmonists endeavor to identify the narrative in Matthew with this passage and others to make Matthew's narrative identical with the account of the revelations made to Joanna's party at a later hour, and therefore entirely distinct from this (see Commentaries on Matthew, Luke, and Mark). John's account is free from ambiguity in itself, whereas the rapid summary given in Luke and the general impression produced by the whole group of events, as recorded by Matthew, suggest the need of supplementary intelligence. The narratives of the synoptists, then, record that in the course of this Easter Day a company of women who may reasonably be supposed to be those who bore the names of Joanna, Susanna, and others, and who had gone to the tomb with their spices, had been met by the Lord himself, either going or returning, and had received the summons to tell the disciples that he would see them in Galilee. The two disciples on their way to Emmaus had at length discovered that the mysterious stranger who accosted them and discoursed so fully was the Lord himself. They returned to Jerusalem to affirm the fact, and found the eleven rejoicing that the Lord had risen indeed, and that "he had appeared to Simon Peter." It would certainly seem, and is at length admitted by all, that the narrative given in the following verses of events occurring on the late evening of the Easter Day could be none other than that which Luke describes (<a href="/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>). This is rendered somewhat perplexing by the record of <a href="/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>, that the language of the two disciples was not accepted by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "the rest." But it is obvious from every one of the narratives how slow of heart even the apostles themselves were to accept the assurance of such unexpected and wonderful phenomena. The extreme dejection of the disciples, followed by their vigorous and invincible faith, is testified by each evangelist; but from the nature of the ease the resurrection of Jesus was, during the course of the entire day, doubted by some. The nature of the doubt, and the method in which it was put to rest, is portrayed in some detail by John (see note on ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Mary</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#8048;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Mariam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3137.htm">Strong's 3137: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Mariam of Hebrew origin; Maria or Mariam, the name of six Christian females.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Magdalene</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#947;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(Magdal&#275;n&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3094.htm">Strong's 3094: </a> </span><span class="str2">Magdalene, a woman of Magdala.
