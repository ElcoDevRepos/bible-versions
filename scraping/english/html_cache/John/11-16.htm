This dual naming highlights the common practice of having both a Hebrew and a Greek name, reflecting the cultural blend of the time. Thomas is often remembered for his skepticism, particularly in <a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>, where he doubts Jesus' resurrection until he sees Him. His character is complex, showing both doubt and deep loyalty.<p><b>said to his fellow disciples</b><br>Thomas addresses the other disciples, indicating a close-knit group that often traveled and ministered together with Jesus. This phrase underscores the communal nature of Jesus' ministry and the shared experiences of His followers. The disciples frequently faced danger and uncertainty, as seen in previous chapters where they encountered opposition from religious leaders.<p><b>&#8220;Let us also go</b><br>Thomas's statement is a response to Jesus' decision to return to Judea, where there was a threat to His life (<a href="/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>). This reflects a willingness to follow Jesus despite the risks, demonstrating a commitment that goes beyond mere words. The disciples often struggled with fear and misunderstanding, yet moments like this reveal their dedication.<p><b>so that we may die with Him.&#8221;</b><br>Thomas expresses a readiness to face death alongside Jesus, showing a profound, albeit somber, loyalty. This echoes the call to discipleship, where Jesus teaches about taking up one's cross (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). The statement foreshadows the eventual martyrdom many disciples would face and highlights the cost of following Christ. It also connects to the theme of resurrection and life, central to the chapter, as Jesus later raises Lazarus from the dead, pointing to His power over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thomas.htm">Thomas (Didymus)</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles, known for his skepticism and later for his declaration of faith in the resurrected Christ.

Earlier, they had warned Jesus, &#8220;Rabbi, just now the Jews were trying to stone You, and You are going back there?&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>). Thomas addresses that fear directly:<p>&#8226; Like Moses urging Israel in <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>, he stiffens their resolve.<p>&#8226; His words mirror Paul&#8217;s later encouragement to his companions before sailing into danger (<a href="/acts/27-31.htm">Acts 27:31</a>).<p>The verse underscores fellowship: disciples don&#8217;t face threats alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us also go</b><p>Thomas moves from discussion to decision.

The name belonged probably to his childhood, and we are wholly without the knowledge which can explain it. The various theories which attempt to do so, from the statement of the Apostolical Constitutions that he had a twin sister Lydia, to the view that the name was given by our Lord to signify his double or halting spiritual nature, are never more than, and are sometimes much less than, elaborate guesses. We may well believe that the name is due to the fact that he was a twin, but of whom it is of no importance that we should know, and it is quite certain that we cannot know. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thomas</span>, in Aramaic, is equivalent in meaning to the Greek name <span class="accented">Didymus</span>, or "twin." This apostle is mentioned in the synoptic Gospels with Matthew, and in Acts (<a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>) with Philip. He is classed with the fishermen (<a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>), and may therefore have been a Galilaean. Ecclesiastical tradition has associated him with Judas (not Iscariot) (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:13), and with Judas the brother of Jesus. He is reputed to have preached ultimately in Parthia and India, there to have suffered martyrdom. The various references to him in this Gospel give, by a few vivid touches, a biography and characterization of singular congruity. <span class="cmt_word">He said to his fellow-disciples</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is only used in this place, and shows that the body of the disciples were being more and more blended into a unity), <span class="cmt_word">Let us go, that we may die with him.</span> Here he manifests a fervent love to his Master, tinged with a sorrowful, melancholy temperament. He saw the danger to his Lord, but at once, with the spirit of self-surrender, was ready to share his fate. Moulton says these words reveal love, but they are "the language of despair and vanished hope. This is the end of all - death, not Messianic kingdom." Surely Thomas may have pondered much the Lord's words about his approaching death, and may have felt ready, along the same line, willingly to yield up his own life for his Master's or with his Master. Too much has been made of Thomas's skepticism and criticism. He was one who wanted visible, tangible evidence; but he was prepared to act impulsively, and to give powerful expression to his faith, whenever the evidence was granted. In <a href="/john/14-5.htm">John 14:5</a> he was still in the dark, but it was not an evil darkness. How could he know, with the clearness which his mind naturally desiderated, whither our Lord was going? No brainless or heartless unbelief led him to ask, "How can we know the way?" At last (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24</a>, etc.), when he wanted ocular, personal, tangible evidence of the resurrection of Jesus, and absented himself in deep melancholy from the company of the eleven, it is clear that his soul was ready for the full manifestation. Before he could have put his finger into the print of the nails, he exclaimed, with adoring gratitude, "MY LORD AND MY GOD!" His hesitation and his conviction, with his superlative ecstatic cry, form the culminating point of the Gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
