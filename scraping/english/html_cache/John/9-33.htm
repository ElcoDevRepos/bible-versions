The statement implies that only someone with divine authority could perform such acts. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true prophets and messengers of God are authenticated by their ability to perform miracles (<a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speaks of the blind seeing as a sign of the Messianic age.<p><b>He could do no such thing.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the impossibility of performing divine acts without God's empowerment. In the cultural and historical context of first-century Judaism, miracles were seen as signs of divine approval and authority. The healing of the blind man serves as a testament to Jesus' divine mission and authority, challenging the religious leaders' understanding of God&#8217;s work. This statement also connects to other New Testament passages where Jesus' works are presented as evidence of His divine nature and mission (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>). It highlights the theme of belief and unbelief, as the Pharisees' refusal to accept the miracle as a sign of Jesus' divine origin contrasts with the faith of those who recognize Him as the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, performing a miraculous healing of a man born blind, demonstrating His divine authority and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>- A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, becoming a witness to Jesus' divine nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>- Religious leaders who questioned the healing and were skeptical of Jesus' authority and origin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where this event takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle.htm">The Miracle</a></b><br>- The healing of the blind man, which serves as a sign of Jesus' divine mission and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_of_jesus.htm">Divine Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' miracles are a testament to His divine authority and mission.

The Bible never shies away from Jesus&#8217; manhood, yet always pairs it with supernatural credentials:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The crowd said, &#8220;Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph?&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-42.htm">John 6:42</a>)&#8212;the same historical figure now giving sight to the blind.<p>By focusing on &#8220;this man,&#8221; the speaker invites the leaders to look at the concrete evidence standing right in front of them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were not from God</b><p>Here is the heart of the argument: origin determines authority. To be &#8220;from God&#8221; means to be sent, authorized, and empowered by Him. Jesus claims that source repeatedly:<p>&#8226; &#8220;My teaching is not My own; it comes from Him who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;I have come here from God&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>).<p>Nicodemus had reached a similar conclusion: &#8220;No one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).
