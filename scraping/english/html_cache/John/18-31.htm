The Jewish leaders had their own legal system based on the Torah, which included religious and civil laws. However, under Roman occupation, their authority was limited, especially in capital cases. Pilate's reluctance to judge Jesus himself may indicate his awareness of the religious nature of the charges and his desire to avoid involvement in what he saw as an internal Jewish matter. This moment highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish autonomy, a recurring theme in the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;We are not permitted to execute anyone,&#8221; the Jews replied.</b><br>This response underscores the limitations placed on the Jewish authorities under Roman rule. While the Sanhedrin could try cases and impose certain penalties, the power to execute was reserved for the Roman governor. This restriction is significant in the context of Jesus' trial, as it necessitated Roman involvement to carry out a death sentence. The Jews' statement also fulfills Jesus' prophecy about the manner of His death, as crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, not a Jewish one. This aligns with Jesus' earlier predictions about being "lifted up" (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14, 12</a>:32-33), pointing to the crucifixion. The inability of the Jewish leaders to execute Jesus themselves also serves to highlight the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan, as it required Roman participation to bring about the specific type of death prophesied.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, who played a crucial role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.

They claim the judicial right; let them exercise it. Their law gave them power to punish, but not the right of capital punishment.

They verbally give up the power, but in reality claim it, and regard the procurator as their executioner. The Jews had lost this power since the time that Archelaus was deposed, and Judaea became a Roman province (A.D. 6 or 7). The Talmud speaks of the loss of this power forty years or more before the destruction of Jerusalem. (Comp.
