The "world" here refers to the system of human society that is opposed to God. Jesus indicates that His brothers are part of this world system, and therefore, the world does not hate them. This reflects the broader biblical theme that those who are aligned with worldly values and systems are not in conflict with it. In <a href="/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>, Jesus later tells His disciples that the world will hate them because they are not of the world, just as He is not.<p><b>but it hates Me</b><br>The world&#8217;s hatred of Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospels. This hatred stems from Jesus' divine nature and His mission to reveal the truth about God and humanity. The religious leaders and many others in society felt threatened by Jesus because He challenged their authority and exposed their hypocrisy. This animosity is prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the Messiah as "despised and rejected by men." Jesus' presence and teachings were a direct challenge to the sinful nature of the world.<p><b>because I testify that its works are evil</b><br>Jesus' testimony about the world's evil works is a central reason for the world's hatred. His teachings and actions consistently exposed sin and called for repentance, which was uncomfortable and unwelcome to those who were entrenched in their ways. This aligns with the role of prophets in the Old Testament, who often faced persecution for speaking God's truth. Jesus, as the ultimate prophet, fulfills this role perfectly. His testimony is not just verbal but also demonstrated through His life and miracles, which reveal the righteousness of God and the sinfulness of humanity. This concept is echoed in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where it is stated that people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His brothers about the world's reaction to Him and His message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the system of human society that is in opposition to God and His ways.

The hatred of the world to Christ was pressing down upon his spirit like an intolerable load. He admitted that, from its own standpoint, there was some justification for the feeling. The world hates its censor; it repels the judgment passed upon it. It is satisfied with itself and its own idea of righteousness. It is satisfied with its own standards and cries and professions, so that to be accused of wrongful notions, of a depravity under the clothing of Pharisaic propriety, of a hidden leprosy which is eating into its vitals, rouses all its animosity. If Christ were to go, he must deliver his soul. Already the thunder peal of <a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22-25</a>, to be shortly delivered after full assertion of the nature of his work, and in the metropolis of the theocracy, was hurtling in his soul, and he foresaw the outburst of maddened rage which would follow; but with melancholy and some gentle irony he said, "<span class="accented">The world</span> against which I have to deliver my prophetic burden <span class="accented">cannot</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, moral impossibility) <span class="accented">hate you!</span> Your aim is to fall in with its demands, to realize its corrupt and unspiritual dreams.
