It sets the stage for the gravity of the moment, as Jesus transitions from teaching to revealing a deep personal anguish. The context is the Last Supper, a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative.<p><b>He became troubled in spirit</b><br>The phrase indicates Jesus' deep emotional distress. This mirrors other moments in the Gospels where Jesus experiences human emotions, such as in the Garden of Gethsemane. It highlights His dual nature as fully God and fully man. The Greek word used here, "tarass&#333;," conveys a sense of agitation and turmoil, emphasizing the weight of the impending betrayal.<p><b>and testified</b><br>This term underscores the solemnity and truthfulness of Jesus' forthcoming statement. In biblical terms, to testify is to bear witness to the truth, often with divine authority. This moment is a fulfillment of His role as a prophet, revealing what is to come.<p><b>&#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you</b><br>The repetition of "truly" (Greek: "amen, amen") is a common Johannine device used to emphasize the certainty and importance of Jesus' words. It serves as a solemn affirmation, drawing attention to the gravity of the revelation. This phrase is used throughout the Gospel of John to introduce significant teachings or revelations.<p><b>one of you will betray Me.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy of betrayal is a direct reference to Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. The betrayal is a pivotal event leading to Jesus' arrest and crucifixion, highlighting themes of human sinfulness and divine sovereignty.

Note on <a href="/john/11-33.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.">John 11:33</a>. He has spoken of the future of those who are true to their commission as Apostles. He now turns in deep emotion to him of whom those words cannot be spoken. The "Verily, verily," and the three verbs, "was troubled," "bare witness," "spake," perhaps imply that there was a pause in which His feeling checked His words, but that the witness to the truth demanded that they should be spoken, painful as they were. For the words themselves, comp.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in <a href="/mark/14-18.htm">Mark 14:18</a> corresponds and finds its explanation in the scene described by John, as also his quotation from <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. It does not follow, because the synoptics omit the "feet-washing," that they were ignorant of it; John's purpose was to record that which they had omitted. On the other hand, John does give some very significant indications of the same general current of inner life in the mind of Jesus and of the twelve. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>) shows that at this very moment Judas had so far given way to his avarice, impatience, disappointment, and innate pride and selfishness, as to be simply seeking his opportunity to betray his Master in the absence of the multitude. He had his price; he was meditating treachery. Granting the mixture of motive which may have agitated him, we condemn the pleading of numerous modern writers, who almost extenuate his malice and represent him as victim of the violent vulgar passion of the multitude for a triumphant secular Messiah. Every touch or stroke in the evangelic narrative shows how utterly Impervious to goodness the traitor really was; and John gives us a further hint, in addition to that supplied by the synoptists, as to the very commencement of the agony, the details of which they prolong into the night. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus was troubled in the spirit</span> (cf. notes on John 11:33). This is one of the strongest expressions used of the sorrows of Christ; the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;</span> even was deeper down in his nature than what is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of Matthew. The distress penetrated from "body" to "soul," and then to inmost "spirit." The Lord was terribly perturbed, not merely with approaching agony aggravated by treachery and desertion, but by the contrast between his love and the issue, between an apostle and his doom. <span class="cmt_word">And he testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you</span>. A close specification of coming events takes the place of the more vague utterances of vers. 17-19. <span class="cmt_word">One of</span> <span class="cmt_word">you shall betray me</span>. The synoptic account introduces the vivid scene of humble and heart-.rending inquiry, "Lord, is it I?" to which the reply was made, "The one that dippeth his hand in the dish with me shall betray me," followed by a still more awful warning, and imprecation calling the self-consciously guilty man to hesitate, to pause for his own sake (<a href="/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a>). And, further, we learn that Judas received the answer, unheard by his fellow-disciples that it was he who was in this imminent danger. This scene, however, was so impressive to the majority that the synoptic tradition failed to record a briefer side-scene, of which John was the principal witness, and which he here describes. <span class="cmt_word">The disciples</span> (<span class="cmt_word">therefore</span>) <span class="cmt_word">were gazing on one another, being in perplexity concerning whom he spake</span>. They were looking on in mute or whispering amazement and tribulation upon one another, being in sore bewilderment (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), but as yet they did not suspect Judas. <span class="cmt_word">There was lying</span>, says our text, reclining at the table, <span class="cmt_word">in the bosom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "against the breast" - <span class="cmt_word">one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.</span> Observe, this sacred designation occurs in <a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>; <a href="/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2</a>; <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20</a>.

We can have no doubt, from the enumeration of the group in <a href="/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2</a>, etc., that it is one of Zebedee's sons. Now one of these, James, as we learn from the narrative of <a href="/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>, soon passed away. The author of the Fourth Gospel does undoubtedly mean to refer to John, and to represent the disciple <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> as no other than himself. The <span class="accented">attitude</span> so carefully described had been adopted by the Jews at table. It shows that John was seated, or was reclining, next to Jesus on his right, and therefore could, more easily than his next companion on the left, have sought and received an answer from the Lord.

Words from that distance could have been overheard by all. At the celebration of the Passover, the guests were accustomed originally to <span class="accented">stand</span>; but after the Captivity the custom fell into desuetude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After] Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
