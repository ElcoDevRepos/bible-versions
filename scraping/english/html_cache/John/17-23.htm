The indwelling of Christ in believers is a central theme in the New Testament, emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's presence (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). The relationship between the Father and the Son is foundational to understanding the Trinity, where Jesus is in perfect unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). This union is not just theological but also relational, inviting believers into a deep, personal relationship with God.<p><b>that they may be perfectly united</b><br>The call for perfect unity among believers reflects Jesus' desire for the Church to be one body, as seen in Paul's letters (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This unity is not merely organizational but spiritual, rooted in love and truth (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3-6</a>). The early church faced challenges in maintaining unity amidst diversity, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles, yet this unity is a testament to the work of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>so that the world may know that You sent Me</b><br>The unity of believers serves as a witness to the world of Jesus' divine mission. This echoes Jesus' earlier statements about being the light of the world (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and the salt of the earth (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13-16</a>). The authenticity of the Christian witness is tied to the visible love and unity among believers, which points to the truth of the Gospel and the reality of Jesus' incarnation and mission.<p><b>and have loved them just as You have loved Me</b><br>This phrase underscores the depth of God's love for believers, equating it with the love the Father has for the Son. This is a profound statement about the nature of divine love, which is unconditional and sacrificial (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>). The love between the Father and the Son is eternal and perfect, and believers are invited to partake in this love (1 <a href="/john/4-16.htm">John 4:16</a>). This love is the foundation for the believer's identity and mission in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>- The speaker of this prayer, Jesus is addressing God the Father, expressing His desire for unity among His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>- The recipient of Jesus' prayer, He is the one who sent Jesus into the world and loves the believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples/believers.htm">The Disciples/Believers</a></b><br>- The immediate audience of Jesus' prayer, representing all future believers who will come to faith through their message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>- Refers to the broader human society that will witness the unity and love among believers as a testimony of Jesus' divine mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' prayer emphasizes the importance of unity among believers, reflecting the unity between Jesus and the Father.

The thought is continued from the last verse, "That they may be one even as we are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one." It is the thought which the words of Christ have uttered again and again, and which we yet feel that no words can utter. The disciples heard the words immediately after they had heard the allegory of the true vine (John 15); and the fullest meaning of separate words and phrases in these chapters is best arrived at by remembering that they were not uttered as separate words and phrases, but that they were spoken as a whole, and should be read as a whole; and that the most unfathomable of them were spoken in prayer from the Son to the Father.<p><span class= "bld">That they may be made perfect in one.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">unto one.</span> The unity is the result of their being made perfect.

"That the world may know" (recognise) here is parallel to "that the world may believe," in the earlier verse. We are to regard it, therefore, as another instance of the repeated expression of the fulness of thought; and this is borne out by the parallel in <a href="/john/13-35.htm" title="By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.">John 13:35</a>; <a href="/john/14-31.htm" title="But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.">John 14:31</a>. The thought which has been introduced here of the conviction of the unbelieving world, seems to be opposed to the context. The prayer is that the world, seeing in its midst the power which binds men together in unity, may believe and know that this is of God, who sent Christ into the world, and may accept for themselves the message of love which the "Sent of God" has brought unto them. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I in them, and thou in me</span>. He does not say, "Thou in them, as thou in me," nor "They in thee, and I in thee;" but he includes in the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> of the previous verse, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span>, and distinctly regards himself as the mediating link of relation between the Father and the disciples. The <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is that of the Son of God, manifested in Christ's consciousness of the God-man-hood; the <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;</span> is the eternal and non-incarnate God.

Faith in its highest form melts into knowledge, full assurance, complete certitude. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> There is superadded to the conviction concerning the Divine mission of the Christ yet another, viz. a conviction of the wonderful love which thou hast shown to them in thus lifting them out of the world into the unity of the spiritual life, into the fellowship of the Son of God. This has twofold bearing. So far as the world is concerned they will see that the love shown to the believers in Christ will be compatible with the same kind of treatment as Christ himself received, and so far as the Divine reality is concerned, it will be seen that they are so closely identified with Christ that the infinite love of God to Christ flows over in its Divine superabundance upon those who are gathered together into him. It is impossible to exclude from these verses the idea of the <span class="accented">visibility</span> of the union and life of the Church, and of the Divine love to it. Nothing is said or hinted, however, about the <span class="accented">nature</span> of that visibility. Christians are not, by reason of their differences, to exclude from this passage the promise that the whole assembly of the Firstborn would make this gracious and convincing impression on the world. They are far enough, in days of mutual recrimination, from realizing the Divine ideal, and should set themselves to remedy the crying evil; but they have no right to import into the words, by reason of their predilection for particular forms of Church organization, an identification of the body of Christ with any specific form. The spiritual union of Christendom in its one faith, hope, and character, is, notwithstanding the divergence of some of its forms of expression, the most stupendous fact in the history of the world. The e<span class="accented">lite</span> of all Churches are drawing more and more into a visible unity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/17-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
