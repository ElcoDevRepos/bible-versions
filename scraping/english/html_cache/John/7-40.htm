The context is important: Jesus had been teaching in the temple courts, and His words were causing division among the people. The "words" likely refer to His declaration about living water (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>), which was a profound statement about the Holy Spirit and His role in believers' lives. This teaching would have resonated deeply with the Jewish audience familiar with Old Testament imagery of water as a symbol of spiritual life and blessing (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a>).<p><b>some of the people said</b><br>The crowd was divided in their opinions about Jesus. This division is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the varied responses to Jesus' ministry. The people were grappling with His identity, trying to reconcile His teachings and miracles with their expectations of the Messiah. This division is indicative of the broader Jewish expectation and confusion regarding the coming of the Messiah and the Prophet like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>).<p><b>&#8220;This is truly the Prophet.&#8221;</b><br>The reference to "the Prophet" is significant. In <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>, Moses spoke of a future prophet whom God would raise up, and many Jews in Jesus' time were expecting this figure to appear. The people&#8217;s identification of Jesus as "the Prophet" shows their recognition of His authoritative teaching and miraculous works, which reminded them of Moses. However, there was still confusion about whether "the Prophet" and the Messiah were the same person or two distinct figures. This statement reflects the people's struggle to understand Jesus' true identity, as He fulfilled both roles: the Prophet like Moses and the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The crowd gathered in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival.
