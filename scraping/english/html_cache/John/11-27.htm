The term "Lord" is significant, as it denotes respect and recognition of Jesus' higher status. In the cultural context of the time, addressing someone as "Lord" was a sign of submission and reverence. Martha's response indicates her faith and trust in Jesus, despite the grief she is experiencing over her brother Lazarus's death. This moment is set in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, which was a place Jesus frequented and where He had close relationships with Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.<p><b>&#8220;I believe that You are the Christ&#8221;</b><br>Martha's declaration of belief is profound, as "the Christ" refers to the Messiah, the anointed one promised in the Hebrew Scriptures. This confession aligns with Peter's declaration in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>, where he also identifies Jesus as the Christ. The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," and it signifies the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the one who would deliver Israel and establish God's kingdom. Martha's faith is a testament to her understanding of Jesus' mission and identity, even before His crucifixion and resurrection.<p><b>&#8220;the Son of God&#8221;</b><br>By calling Jesus "the Son of God," Martha acknowledges His divine nature and unique relationship with God the Father. This title is significant in the Gospel of John, which emphasizes Jesus' divinity and His role as the revealer of God. The concept of the Son of God is rooted in Old Testament passages like <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as God's Son. This title also connects to the broader theme in John's Gospel of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), who reveals the Father to humanity.<p><b>&#8220;who was to come into the world.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects the Jewish expectation of a coming Messiah who would enter the world to bring salvation and restoration. It echoes prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which speak of a ruler from the line of David who would establish God's kingdom. The idea of "coming into the world" also highlights the incarnation, the belief that Jesus, as the pre-existent Word, entered human history to fulfill God's redemptive plan. Martha's statement shows her recognition of Jesus as the fulfillment of these messianic prophecies and her hope in His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>The sister of Mary and Lazarus, known for her active service and hospitality.
