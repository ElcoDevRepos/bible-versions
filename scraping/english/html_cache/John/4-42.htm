The context is significant as it highlights the cultural barriers Jesus broke by speaking to a Samaritan woman, which was unusual due to the animosity between Jews and Samaritans. The woman's testimony played a crucial role in leading her community to Christ, demonstrating the power of personal witness.<p><b>We now believe not only because of your words</b><br>Initially, the Samaritans' interest in Jesus was sparked by the woman's testimony. This reflects the biblical principle that faith often begins with hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). However, their belief matured beyond her words, indicating a personal encounter with Jesus that deepened their faith.<p><b>we have heard for ourselves</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of personal experience in faith. The Samaritans' belief was no longer secondhand; they had a direct encounter with Jesus. This mirrors the broader biblical theme that true faith is based on personal relationship and revelation, as seen in the transformation of individuals who encounter Christ throughout the Gospels.<p><b>and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world</b><br>This declaration is profound, especially coming from Samaritans, who were considered outsiders by the Jews. The title "Savior of the world" signifies Jesus' universal mission, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth. This acknowledgment by the Samaritans foreshadows the global scope of the Gospel, as later seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A key figure in <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, she encounters Jesus at the well and becomes a witness to her community about Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritans.htm">The Samaritans</a></b><br>Residents of the town who initially believe in Jesus because of the woman's testimony and later because of their personal encounter with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the account, He reveals Himself as the Messiah and the Savior of the world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sychar.htm">Sychar</a></b><br>The Samaritan town where the events take place, highlighting the cultural tensions between Jews and Samaritans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_well_of_jacob.htm">The Well of Jacob</a></b><br>The setting for Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman, symbolizing spiritual thirst and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_personal_testimony.htm">The Power of Personal Testimony</a></b><br>The Samaritan woman's testimony initiates belief in her community.
