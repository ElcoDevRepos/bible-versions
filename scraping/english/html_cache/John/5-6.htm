Jesus often noticed those who were marginalized or in need, as seen in other instances like the woman at the well (John 4) and the blind man (John 9). The setting is the pool of Bethesda, a place where many disabled people gathered, hoping for healing. This reflects Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>).<p><b>and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition</b><br>The man's prolonged suffering is emphasized, highlighting Jesus' omniscience and empathy. The text suggests that Jesus knew the man's history without being told, demonstrating His divine insight. This aligns with other instances where Jesus knew people's thoughts and pasts, such as with Nathanael (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>).<p><b>He asked him, &#8220;Do you want to get well?&#8221;</b><br>This question may seem unnecessary, but it serves to engage the man's faith and desire for healing. It also reflects the biblical principle of free will and personal responsibility. Jesus often required a response of faith before performing miracles, as seen with the blind men in <a href="/matthew/9-28.htm">Matthew 9:28-29</a>. The question also invites introspection, prompting the man to consider his true desires and readiness for change.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

But he hears, in tones that went to the heart as he listened to them, the strange question, stranger indeed than "Wilt thou. . . .," "<span class= "ital">Wiliest thou</span> to be made whole?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus saw him lying there, and perceived</span> (came to know by his searching glance and intuitive knowledge of the history of others) <span class="cmt_word">that he had during a long time already been</span> (<span class="accented">in that condition</span>, or <span class="accented">in sickness</span>,) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>said unto him</span> - spontaneously, in the royalty of his benefactions, not demanding from the man even the faith to be healed, and dealing with him almost as he did with the dead - Wilt thou be made whole? The leper came beseeching him, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." The leper was quite sure of his own intense desire for cleansing, and all he questioned was the <span class="accented">will</span>, not the <span class="accented">power</span>, of Jesus. The admission of the power was a tacit cry for healing. The questioning of Jesus on this occasion involved an offer of mercy. "<span class="accented">Dost thou veritably wish</span> for health and strength?" The question implies a doubt. The man may have got so accustomed to his life of indolence and mendicancy as to regard deliverance from his apparent wretchedness, with all consequent responsibilities of work and energy and self-dependence, as a doubtful blessing. He whined out, with professional drawl, his oft-told story, reflecting very much upon his lovelessness and quarrelsomeness, and ugly temper. There are many who are not anxious for salvation, with all the demands it makes upon the life, with its summons to self-sacrifice and the repression of self-indulgence. There are many religious impostors who prefer tearing open their spiritual wounds to the first passerby, and hugging their grievance, to being made into robust men upon whom the burden of responsibility will immediately fall. In this case the sign of his palsied nature was written upon his face, and was probably known to every passerby. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(touton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">lying [there]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katakeimenon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2621.htm">Strong's 2621: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and keimai; to lie down, i.e. be sick; specially, to recline at a meal.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">realized</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gnous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had spent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(echei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
