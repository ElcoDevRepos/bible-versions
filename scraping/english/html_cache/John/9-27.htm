The man born blind, who was healed by Jesus, is speaking to the religious leaders who refuse to accept the miracle. This reflects a recurring theme in the Gospels where Jesus' teachings and miracles are met with skepticism and rejection by the religious authorities. The phrase underscores the importance of spiritual openness and the willingness to hear and accept the truth. In a broader biblical context, this echoes the prophetic warnings in the Old Testament about having ears but not hearing (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>Why do you want to hear it again?</b><br>The healed man's question points to the futility of repeating the testimony to those who are unwilling to believe. It suggests a sense of frustration and incredulity at their persistent questioning. This can be seen as a challenge to the Pharisees' motives, questioning whether their inquiry is genuine or merely an attempt to find grounds to accuse Jesus. This reflects the broader theme of spiritual blindness, where physical sight is restored, but spiritual insight remains lacking.<p><b>Do you also want to become His disciples?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question is both bold and ironic. The healed man implies that the Pharisees' interest in Jesus' actions might indicate a desire to follow Him, though he likely knows this is not their intention. This statement challenges the Pharisees' authority and exposes their hypocrisy. It also highlights the growing division between those who recognize Jesus as the Messiah and those who reject Him. The concept of discipleship is central to the New Testament, where following Jesus involves a commitment to His teachings and a transformation of life. This moment foreshadows the eventual spread of Jesus' message beyond the Jewish leaders to a broader audience, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah being a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_man.htm">The Blind Man</a></b><br>A man who was born blind and healed by Jesus, demonstrating Jesus' divine power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who questioned the blind man about his healing, skeptical of Jesus' identity and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who performs the miracle of healing the blind man, revealing His divine nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_healing.htm">The Miracle of Healing</a></b><br>The event where Jesus heals the blind man, serving as a sign of His messianic mission and divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/boldness_in_testimony.htm">Boldness in Testimony</a></b><br>The healed man's courage in speaking to the Pharisees challenges us to be bold in sharing our faith, even when faced with skepticism or hostility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness_vs._physical_blindness.htm">Spiritual Blindness vs. Physical Blindness</a></b><br>The Pharisees' inability to see the truth about Jesus highlights the danger of spiritual blindness, urging us to seek spiritual insight and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>The blind man's willingness to face the Pharisees' scorn reflects the cost of following Jesus, reminding us to be prepared for opposition in our own discipleship journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_personal_experience.htm">The Power of Personal Experience</a></b><br>The man's personal encounter with Jesus serves as a powerful testimony, encouraging us to share our own experiences of God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening.htm">The Importance of Listening</a></b><br>The Pharisees' refusal to listen to the man's testimony warns us of the consequences of hard-heartedness and the importance of being open to God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_9_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 9:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_9_27_Boldly_witness_Jesus_today.htm">How does John 9:27 challenge us to boldly witness about Jesus today?

The verse challenges every reader&#8212;having heard the truth, will we listen and follow?<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">I have told you already, and ye did not hear.</span>--The man becomes weary of this cross-questioning, the purpose of which is sufficiently clear to him. His first answer was in the fewest possible words (<a href="/john/9-15.htm" title="Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.">John 9:15</a>, compared with <a href="/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>), and even these he will not repeat. There is some difficulty about the meaning of the word "hear" in the two clauses of this verse. When the man says "Ye did not hear," we naturally understand "did not heed;" but when he goes on to say, "Wherefore would ye hear it again? the word clearly has its ordinary sense of hearing. The same word occurs in the two clauses in the Greek, just as it does in the English, and we are scarcely justified in giving it two distinct meanings. If we were to read both clauses as questions, we should avoid this difficulty, and get a sense which would suit the evident feeling of the man. He is impatient, and expresses this in a series of rapid questions. "I have told you already, and did ye not hear? wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be His disciples?"<p><span class= "bld">Will ye also be his disciples?</span><span class= "ital">--</span>The words refer, probably, to some who are His disciples, not to the man himself as being, or being ready to become, a disciple. This is a further stage of his spiritual education which is to follow, but has not yet arrived (<a href="/context/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35-38</a>). The man must have known of the existence of a band of disciples, who indeed in his presence had questioned their Master concerning him (<a href="/john/9-2.htm" title="And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?">John 9:2</a>), and it is not unlikely that while the parents were being questioned, the son may have learnt more concerning the work of Christ. The question puts the irony in the severest form, "Surely <span class= "ital">ye</span> also do not wish to become His disciples?" It may have been designed, or may only have been as an arrow drawn at a venture; but there must have been among those of whom it was asked, men who tried in vain to encase themselves in the armour of authority, which would repel his shaft and silence him. It must have gone through the joints of the harness and pierced to the hearts of men like Nicodemus, who were half-disciples without the "courage of their convictions." Here was the blind beggar making an open avowal of that which the Pharisees and rulers dared only to confess by night (<a href="/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered them, I told you already, and ye did not hear</span> (the Italic Versions and the Vulgate here omit the negation, which De Wette says would be caster of comprehension; but as it stands, the sentence is equivalent to "you had no ears, you took no heed, if you had already listened to the simple facts"): <span class="cmt_word">wherefore would ye hear it again?</span> You will pay no more heed now than then; or do ye want to transform it into a charge?
