This law, given by God to Moses, includes commandments and regulations found in the Torah, particularly in books like Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The law was not only religious but also civil, governing various aspects of life. The Jewish leaders' appeal to the law highlights their attempt to maintain religious authority and order, even under Roman occupation.<p><b>answered the Jews,</b><br>The term "the Jews" in the Gospel of John often refers to the Jewish religious leaders, such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, rather than the Jewish people as a whole. These leaders were responsible for maintaining religious orthodoxy and were often in conflict with Jesus due to His teachings and actions, which they perceived as threats to their authority and interpretation of the law.<p><b>and according to that law He must die,</b><br>The specific law they refer to is likely <a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>, which prescribes death for blasphemy. The Jewish leaders believed that Jesus' claim to divinity constituted blasphemy, a serious offense warranting capital punishment. However, under Roman rule, the Jewish authorities did not have the power to execute someone, which is why they brought Jesus to Pilate.<p><b>because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.</b><br>This declaration is central to the identity and mission of Jesus. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus refers to Himself as the Son of God, a title that signifies His unique relationship with the Father and His divine nature. This claim fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>.

They feel the bitter sarcasm of Pilate's taunt, and appeal to their own law, which, in accordance with the general Roman policy, was in force in all questions which did not directly affect the Government. They change the accusation then from one of treason against Caesar (<a href="/john/19-12.htm" title="And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.">John 19:12</a>), of which Pilate claimed to be judge, to one of blasphemy against God, of which they only could be judges; and assert that Jesus is by that law guilty of a capital offence, for which He ought to die. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63-66</a>, and <a href="/luke/22-70.htm" title="Then said they all, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You say that I am.">Luke 22:70</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews answered him</span>, ready with an expedient which hitherto they had not ventured to try upon the Roman official. It might have met with the kind of reception which Gallio gave to the accusers of Sosthenes in the Corinthian court. He might have driven them at point of spear or whip from the judgment-seat. "The Jews' here mentioned, rather than "the chief priests and officers" of the previous verse, for the multitude - by some other spokesmen than they - exclaim, <span class="cmt_word">We have a law, and according to that</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">law</span> <span class="cmt_word">he ought to die</span>; whatever you may have made of the charge of political treason. In full session of our Sanhedrin, <span class="cmt_word">he made himself</span>, represented himself, as something more than Caesar, nay, more than man, as <span class="cmt_word">Son of God</span>. "King of Jews" was a usurpation of the Messianic dignity; but he had claimed, in their very hearing, to be more than a national leader. He raised himself to the position of being "Jehovah's King upon his holy hill," to whom Jehovah had sworn, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" "Son of God" as well as "King of Israel." Pilate would not and could not understand this strange "testimony to the truth;" and the people were now in a more angry and excited state than ever, and appealed to the law of their own code (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), which denounced death upon the blasphemer. This charge was just unless the claim was true. If Christ had not been to his own inmost consciousness what he said he was, the Sanhedrin was in the right; and, according to law, he was guilty of death. It is here vastly interesting to see another indication of relation between the synoptic narrative and the Fourth Gospel. Though John passed ever the scenes before the Sanhedrin, and the circumstance that Christ had been actually there doomed because he had made there no secret of his Divine claims, and declared himself to be a king in a higher sense than Pilate dreamed; yet John has given clear proof that he was well aware of the confession, and records the still more striking tact that this special claim of supreme prerogative actually came to the ears and before the judgment-seat of Rome. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7977;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
