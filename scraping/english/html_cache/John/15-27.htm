The Greek word for "testify" is "martyreo," which implies giving evidence or bearing witness, often at personal risk. This call to testify is consistent with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the role of the apostles as foundational witnesses to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). The cultural context of the time was one of oral tradition, where eyewitness testimony was crucial for the spread of information. The disciples' testimony would serve as a primary source of the Gospel message, crucial for the early church's growth.<p><b>because you have been with Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the unique position of the disciples as those who have personally experienced Jesus' ministry. Their firsthand experience with Jesus gives them authority and credibility as witnesses. In Jewish culture, the testimony of those who have directly observed events was highly valued (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The disciples' intimate knowledge of Jesus' teachings and miracles equips them to accurately convey His message. This personal relationship with Jesus is a type of the intimate relationship believers are called to have with Christ, as seen in the vine and branches metaphor earlier in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.<p><b>from the beginning</b><br>This phrase refers to the beginning of Jesus' public ministry when He called His disciples to follow Him. It underscores the continuity and consistency of their witness, having been with Jesus from the start. This is significant in establishing the authenticity of their testimony, as they have observed His life and teachings over an extended period. The phrase also connects to the prologue of John's Gospel, which speaks of Jesus as the Word who was with God from the beginning (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>), drawing a parallel between the eternal nature of Christ and the enduring witness of the disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing His disciples during the Last Supper.

Their lifelong companionship with Jesus equips them to speak with credibility; the divine imperative makes silence impossible. By joining the Spirit&#8217;s testimony with the disciples&#8217; own, Jesus guarantees that the truth about Him goes forward through both supernatural power and reliable human eyes&#8212;and that double witness still anchors the Church&#8217;s proclamation today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And ye also shall bear witness.</span>--The tense is present, <span class= "ital">and ye also bear witness;</span> or, <span class= "ital">and ye also are witnesses.</span> (Comp.
