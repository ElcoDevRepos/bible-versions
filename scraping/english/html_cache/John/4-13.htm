Jewish men typically did not speak publicly with women, especially Samaritan women, due to longstanding animosity between Jews and Samaritans (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). This interaction underscores Jesus' mission to reach all people, transcending social and ethnic barriers, as seen in His ministry to Gentiles and marginalized groups (<a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21-28</a>).<p><b>Everyone who drinks this water</b><br>Here, "this water" refers to the physical water from Jacob's well, a significant historical and religious site for both Jews and Samaritans. The well symbolizes the old covenant and the limitations of the Law, which could not provide eternal satisfaction or salvation. The reference to "everyone" emphasizes the universal human condition of spiritual thirst and the inadequacy of earthly solutions to fulfill spiritual needs.<p><b>will be thirsty again</b><br>This phrase illustrates the temporary nature of physical and worldly solutions to spiritual problems. It echoes the theme of human insufficiency and the need for something greater, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>, where human desires are never fully satisfied. The statement foreshadows Jesus' offer of "living water" (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), which represents the Holy Spirit and eternal life, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-3</a> about God's provision of spiritual sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who offers spiritual truths and eternal life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A woman from Samaria who encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.

Our whole life is made up of intermittent desires and partial satisfaction, of passion and satiation, of <span class="accented">ennui</span> and then of some new longing. This flow and ebb, ebb and flow, of desire belong to the very nature of human appetite. More than that, human desire is never really satiated. Our souls can never be at rest till they find rest in God.
