In Jewish burial customs of the time, the body was wrapped in linen cloths, and a separate cloth was used for the head. This practice is consistent with the burial customs described in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/john/11-44.htm">John 11:44</a>, where Lazarus is described as having his face wrapped with a cloth. The use of a separate head cloth highlights the care and respect given to the deceased, even in death. This detail underscores the reality of Jesus' death and burial, affirming the physical resurrection that follows.<p><b>was rolled up</b><br>The phrase "rolled up" suggests that the cloth was not simply discarded or left in disarray, but was intentionally folded or arranged. This detail is significant because it indicates that the removal of the cloth was done with purpose and order, contrasting with the idea of a grave robbery, where items would likely be left in chaos. The orderly arrangement of the cloths serves as evidence of the resurrection, suggesting that Jesus' body was not taken by thieves, but that He rose from the dead. This act of rolling up the cloth can also be seen as a sign of Jesus' authority and control over death, as He calmly and deliberately left the grave.<p><b>lying separate from the linen cloths</b><br>The separation of the head cloth from the other linen cloths is a notable detail that emphasizes the uniqueness of the resurrection event. In the cultural context, the separation could symbolize a distinction between the earthly and the divine, as Jesus' resurrection marks the transition from His earthly ministry to His glorified state. This separation also serves as a visual testimony to the disciples and others who would come to the tomb, providing a clear sign that something extraordinary had occurred. The distinct placement of the cloths can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions of His resurrection, as well as Old Testament prophecies that allude to the Messiah's victory over death, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the resurrection account, whose burial cloths are found in the tomb.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was laid after His crucifixion and where the resurrection is discovered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Disciples who run to the tomb to verify Mary Magdalene's report of the empty tomb.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>The first to discover the empty tomb and report it to the disciples.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burial_cloths.htm">The Burial Cloths</a></b><br>The linen cloths and the separate head cloth found in the tomb, signifying Jesus' resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_the_burial_cloths.htm">Significance of the Burial Cloths</a></b><br>The neatly folded head cloth signifies order and intentionality, contrasting with a grave robbery scenario.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_victory_over_death.htm">Symbol of Victory Over Death</a></b><br>The empty tomb and the left-behind cloths symbolize Jesus' victory over death, affirming His divine nature and the promise of eternal life for believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_evidence.htm">Faith and Evidence</a></b><br>The physical evidence of the empty tomb and the burial cloths invites believers to a faith that is both spiritual and grounded in historical events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection_as_a_foundation_of_hope.htm">Resurrection as a Foundation of Hope</a></b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian hope, assuring believers of their future resurrection and eternal life with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_witness.htm">Call to Witness</a></b><br>Just as the disciples were witnesses to the resurrection, believers are called to share the message of the risen Christ with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_20_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 20:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_folded_face_cloth_in_John_20_7.htm">Why is the "face cloth" folded separately in John 20:7 significant?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_20_7_Order_in_Jesus_resurrection.htm">How does John 20:7 demonstrate the orderliness of Jesus' resurrection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_linked_to_John_20_7.htm">What Old Testament prophecies connect to the resurrection details in John 20:7?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_John_20_7_daily_how.htm">How can we apply the message of John 20:7 to our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_20_7_Jesus_power_over_death.htm">What does John 20:7 teach about Jesus' power over death and the grave?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_the_face_cloth_folded_separately.htm">Why was the face cloth in John 20:7 folded separately from the linen cloths?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_folded_cloth_in_John_20_7.htm">What does the folded face cloth in John 20:7 symbolize about Jesus' resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_20_7_s_role_in_resurrection_proof.htm">How does John 20:7 support the historical accuracy of the resurrection account?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_a_folded_napkin_mean_biblically.htm">What does the folded napkin symbolize in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_shroud_of_turin.htm">What is the Shroud of Turin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/were_women_told_about_jesus'_body.htm">Were the women informed about Jesus' body's fate?

In this description and in this verse the minute knowledge and remembrance of an eye-witness reaches its climax. The very fact that the napkin was folded did not escape the writer's eye, nor fade from his memory.<p><span class= "bld">Then went in also that other disciple . . .</span>--If the vivid details of this picture impress us with the fact that we are in the presence of an eye-witness, none the less do the traits of character remind us of all that we know from other sources of the actors in the scene. The bold impetuosity of St. Peter, and the gentle reverence of St. John, are represented in him who quickly entered into the sepulchre, and in him who stood gazing into it, and afterwards went in. He went in, "therefore," as the original exactly means, because he heard from Peter of what he had seen.<p><span class= "bld">And he saw, and believed.</span>--The gentler character was also the more receptive, and this appears to be intimated in this verse. Nothing is said of St. Peter's faith, but St. John seems to unveil for us the inner history of his own spiritual life. The word for "see" is different from either of those used before in <a href="/context/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5-6</a>. (Comp. <a href="/luke/10-23.htm" title="And he turned him to his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see:">Luke 10:23</a>.) It is not that he saw, as from a distance, nor yet that he beheld that which was immediately presented to the gaze; it is not that he saw in any merely physical sense, but that he saw with the eye of the mind, and grasped the truth which lay beneath the phenomena around him. He saw, and he who had believed before, found in this fact the stepping-stone to a higher faith. (Comp.
