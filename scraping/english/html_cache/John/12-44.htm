The act of crying out suggests a public declaration meant to capture attention. In the context of the Gospel of John, Jesus often speaks with authority and urgency, especially as His earthly ministry approaches its climax. This public proclamation is significant as it occurs during the final week of His life, a time when He is preparing His followers for His impending crucifixion and resurrection.<p><b>Whoever believes in Me</b><br>Belief in Jesus is a central theme in the Gospel of John. This phrase underscores the necessity of faith in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. The concept of belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus for salvation. This echoes <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where belief in Jesus is linked to eternal life. The invitation is universal, as indicated by "whoever," emphasizing that salvation through Jesus is available to all who believe.<p><b>does not believe in Me alone</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the interconnectedness of Jesus with the Father. Belief in Jesus is not isolated but is intrinsically linked to belief in God the Father. This reflects the unity and co-equality of the Father and the Son, a recurring theme in John's Gospel. It also addresses the Jewish audience's understanding of monotheism, affirming that belief in Jesus is consistent with belief in the one true God.<p><b>but in the One who sent Me</b><br>This phrase identifies God the Father as the sender of Jesus, reinforcing the divine mission and authority of Jesus. The concept of being "sent" is significant in John's Gospel, as it emphasizes Jesus' divine origin and purpose. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming of the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the anointed one is sent by God. This connection between Jesus and the Father is crucial for understanding the nature of the Trinity and the divine plan of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the crowd, emphasizing His divine mission and unity with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking, representing the broader Jewish community and, by extension, all who hear His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "the One who sent Me," highlighting the relationship between Jesus and God the Father, and the divine authority behind Jesus' mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_with_the_father.htm">Unity with the Father</a></b><br>Jesus' statement underscores His divine nature and unity with God.

Genuine faith in Christ ushers us into the very heart of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) The last few verses (<a href="/context/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37-43</a>) have given us the thoughts of St. John as he looked back on the unbelief of Judaism. He had given our Lord's closing word in <a href="/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>, and there stated that He hid Himself from them. He now gives other words of our Lord condemning the unbelief of which he had been speaking, and of which the probable explanation is that they are a summary of words previously uttered by our Lord, but grouped together here as specially bearing upon the subject of which he is writing. For the remaining verses of this chapter, the Notes will therefore consist chiefly of reference to earlier passages where the same words have already occurred.<p>(44) <span class= "bld">Jesus cried and said.</span>--Comp.

This forbids our understanding these words of any private discourse addressed to the disciples. The phrase implies public teaching addressed to the multitude, and it may be inferred that there was some such teaching after <a href="/john/12-36.htm" title="While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.">John 12:36</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-50.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The <span class="accented">summation of the supreme conflict between our Lord and the world</span>. The portion of the chapter which follows is regarded by most commentators, Lucke, Meyer, Godet, Olshausen, and Westcott, as a summary of our Lord's teaching, as a reiteration by the evangelist of those salient points of the Lord's ministry which, while they are the life of the world, are nevertheless the grounds on which blinded eyes and hardened hearts rejected him. Vers. 44-46 characterize the believer; vers. 47, 48 emphasize Christ's relation to the unbeliever; vers. 49, 50 the principle upon which both deliverances turn and will continue to turn. There are those who think that these were special private addresses to the disciples, uttered after our Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) was hidden, but the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>) "cried aloud," would not then have been used, as it was used for the most public expressions of his doctrine, when given once for all (here comp. <a href="/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28, 37</a>, with <a href="/luke/18-39.htm">Luke 18:39</a>). Keim, De Wette, Baur, and Hilgenfeld think that, because there is no fresh departure here, it is proof that <span class="accented">all</span> the discourses of Christ in John are similarly put together with no historical basis. But if it be so, this differs strangely from all the rest of our Lord's discourses recorded by John in that it has no occasion, or persons, or opportunity to which it seems to fit. Certain aorists suggest the idea that John has here given specimens of our Lord's appeals which had ended in his being rejected by the nation as a whole. Luthardt takes the view of these words being spoken <span class="accented">totidem verbis</span> on our Lord's departure, and with him Hengstenberg also agrees. These critics suppose that they form the closing words of our Lord's public ministry, delayed by the intercalary remarks of the evangelist, and really belong to the close of the thirty-sixth verse. Though the expressions flint follow are built upon the discourses elsewhere uttered, we admit, with Hengstenberg, that there is no verbal parallel that is at all close, and that therefore the evangelist must not be quoting from what he had already reported, but giving the substance of a threefold class of observations found from one end of the Gospel to the other, and in words that he had heard the Master use. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44, 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,PGBR> <span class="cmt_word">but on him that sent me; and he that beholdeth me, beholdeth him that sent me</span>. These words do not occur before, but in every form our Lord had exalted "him that sent him." His doctrine or teaching, his purpose in manifestation, the secret food that sustained him, the Divine presence that never left him alone, the entire background of the mission of his human will and life into the world, the object of faith to men as revealed in his humanity, and that which the spiritual eye ought to see, nay - if the beholder did but know it does see, constitute an unveiling of the eternal Father who sent him into the world (see <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17, 18, 29</a>; <a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28, 42</a>; <a href="/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; cf. also <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 9, 24</a>). It becomes, then, of high value to grasp the truth. We actually believe in God when believing in him. His mission is lost in the glory of God who appears in him. So far as he is <span class="accented">sent</span>, he was necessarily of lower order and rank than he who sent him. His humanity began to be in time; it was generated in the womb of the Virgin; it was sanctified and sent into the world; and yet through it there was the highest revelation of the Father. We cannot attribute so stupendous a thought to the evangelist, and at the same time we admit the portentous singularity and uniqueness of the consciousness which could thus aver identity of nature with God and the completeness of revelation that the Speaker was making in himself of the Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cried out,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekraxen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cry aloud, shriek.
