This relationship is significant as it underscores the close-knit nature of the early disciples. Andrew is often seen as a bridge to Peter, who would become a leading figure in the early church. The mention of Andrew first suggests his role in bringing Peter to Jesus, as seen later in the Gospel. This familial link also emphasizes the theme of evangelism within families, a common occurrence in the New Testament.<p><b>was one of the two</b><br>This phrase refers to Andrew being one of the two disciples of John the Baptist who first followed Jesus. The identity of the other disciple is not explicitly mentioned, but it is traditionally believed to be John, the author of the Gospel. This highlights the importance of personal witness and testimony in the spread of the Gospel message. The fact that Andrew is one of the first to follow Jesus indicates his openness to spiritual truth and readiness to embrace the Messiah.<p><b>who heard John&#8217;s testimony</b><br>John the Baptist's role as a forerunner to Christ is crucial here. His testimony about Jesus as the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-36.htm">John 1:36</a>) prepared the hearts of his disciples to follow Jesus. This emphasizes the prophetic role of John the Baptist as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, serving as a bridge between the Old and New Testaments. The act of hearing and responding to testimony is a recurring theme in the Gospel, illustrating the power of spoken witness in leading others to Christ.<p><b>and followed Jesus</b><br>The decision to follow Jesus marks a pivotal moment of discipleship and commitment. This action signifies a transition from being a disciple of John the Baptist to becoming a follower of Christ, indicating a deeper understanding and acceptance of Jesus' identity and mission. The concept of following Jesus is central to the Christian faith, symbolizing a life of obedience, learning, and transformation. This phrase also connects to the broader theme of discipleship found throughout the Gospels, where following Jesus often involves leaving behind former ways of life and embracing a new path.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/andrew.htm">Andrew</a></b><br>One of the first disciples of Jesus, Andrew is identified as Simon Peter's brother.

Peter will later dominate the narrative, but here Andrew shines first.<p>&#8226; The wording teaches that kingdom significance isn&#8217;t measured by fame. God often works through the &#8220;less prominent&#8221; to launch great movements (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Family ties become gospel bridges: Andrew&#8217;s first instinct is to introduce his brother to Christ (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was one of the two</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;two&#8221; refers back to <a href="/john/1-35.htm">John 1:35-39</a>, where two of John the Baptist&#8217;s disciples spend a day with Jesus.

Andrew&#8217;s step models immediate obedience.<p>&#8226; Jesus never turns away sincere seekers (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).

The other disciple, with the studied reticence ever preserved about his own designation, is left unnamed by the writer. "Simon Peter" is here spoken of as the better-known man. The bestowment of this designation on Andrew shows that the Gospel was written when Peter's greater name was widely recognized, and the reference is made without the faintest touch of depreciation. Simon Peter's reputation gives force and importance to the record of Andrew's faith. The evangelist's intimate friend Andrew is thus lifted out of his comparative obscurity among the apostolate, not by his association with John, but by his relationship with Simon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Andrew,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#941;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Andreas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_406.htm">Strong's 406: </a> </span><span class="str2">From aner; manly; Andreas, an Israelite.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;nos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
