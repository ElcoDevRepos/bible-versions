They often clashed with Jesus over interpretations of the law. In this context, "because of this" refers to the healing of the man born blind, which Jesus performed on the Sabbath. This act challenged their understanding of Sabbath observance.<p><b>&#8220;This man is not from God,</b><br>The Pharisees questioned Jesus' divine authority because He did not conform to their legalistic standards. In their view, a true prophet or man of God would strictly observe the Sabbath laws. This reflects their limited understanding of God's work and the nature of the Messiah, who was prophesied to bring healing and restoration (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>for He does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221;</b><br>The Pharisees believed that Jesus violated the Sabbath by performing a healing, which they considered work. However, Jesus taught that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>) and demonstrated that acts of mercy and necessity were lawful (<a href="/matthew/12-12.htm">Matthew 12:12</a>). This highlights the tension between Jesus' teachings and the Pharisaic interpretation of the law.<p><b>But others said,</b><br>This indicates that not all Pharisees were in agreement. There was a diversity of thought among them, suggesting that some were open to considering Jesus' actions and teachings more deeply.

In Jewish thought, miracles were often seen as evidence of divine approval. The signs Jesus performed, such as healing the blind, were messianic in nature (<a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>), challenging the notion that He could be sinful.<p><b>And there was division among them.</b><br>The division among the Pharisees illustrates the polarizing effect of Jesus' ministry. His teachings and miracles forced people to confront their beliefs about God, the law, and the Messiah. This division is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as Jesus' identity and mission often led to conflict and debate (<a href="/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>, <a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus performs a miracle by healing a man born blind, which leads to a significant theological debate among the Pharisees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>- A religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

They judged by external conformity rather than by the works and words that fulfilled Scripture (<a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>). By labeling Him &#8220;not from God,&#8221; they stood in direct conflict with testimonies such as <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14 and 5</a>:36, where the Father&#8217;s endorsement is unmistakable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;for He does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221;</b><p>Their charge rested on man-made boundaries, not the Law itself (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-10</a> allows deeds of mercy, cf. <a href="/matthew/12-11.htm">Matthew 12:11-12</a>).

The verse reminds us that every encounter with Christ demands a response, revealing whether our confidence rests in rule-keeping or in the Savior who opens blind eyes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.</span>--See Note on <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>, and reference there. Here the truth of the miracle is granted, but it is urged that the power by which it is wrought cannot be of God, because it was exercised on the Sabbath day. The inference is, that it was done by the influence of the power of evil.<p><span class= "bld">Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?</span>--This question is asked by the better party among the Pharisees, represented, as we know, by Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, and perhaps by Gamaliel. They see the inference implied in the earlier question, and appeal to the nature of the miracles wrought. Works of mercy, and love, and power, were not the product of a life of sin, or of communion with the powers of darkness. We find evidence of this better spirit among the Pharisees before, in the question of Nicodemus (<a href="/john/7-51.htm" title="Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does?">John 7:51</a>). It has now extended to others. The teaching on the earlier work on the Sabbath (John 5) has led some among them, at least, to look with allowance upon this.<p><span class= "bld">And there was a division among them.</span>--Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16</span> ? indicates, as the evangelist so often does elsewhere (<a href="/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>), that the words and works of Christ produce opposite effects on different classes. <span class="cmt_word">Certain individuals of the Pharisees therefore said</span> among themselves, <span class="cmt_word">This Man</span> - referring to Christ, then uppermost in their minds and in their machinations - <span class="cmt_word">This Man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath.</span> The form of the sentence is peculiarly contemptuous, the word "man" being thrown very emphatically to the end of the sentence. This, in their opinion, is another offence against the Law, after serious warning. The previous controversy (<a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>.) had produced no effect upon Jesus. He continued, in their opinion, to invalidate all his claims by violating the sabbath laws, which they had brought to the highest point of perfection. Renan and others insist on Christ's repeated violation of the sabbath; but the fact is that the Lord sustained the highest meaning of the sabbath, though he resolutely repudiated the inhuman glosses and manifest absurdities of the traditionary customs and rabbinical rules. Jesus could not be, they thought (or argued), "from God," invested with his authority, or doing his works, so tong as he would not take their view of the sabbath. This Jesus is making obstinate assault upon their prejudices. On seven distinct occasions the Lord chose to heal on the sabbath, and thus to set the restrictions of august rabbis at defiance. But even in the great Sanhedrin, in the highest council of the nation, sat men of the character of Joseph, Nicodemus, and Gamaliel, who would get some idea of the Divine commission of Jesus from the simple fact of the miracles. In this smaller court the opponents of Christ ignore and doubt the miracle itself, on account of the unsabbatic heresy, while a few are convinced that signs of this kind (and probably they had many in their minds) were in themselves proof of Divine co-operation and approval. <span class="cmt_word">But others said, How can a man that is a sinner</span> (on your hypothesis) <span class="cmt_word">do such signs</span>? "As far as they go, these miracles are demonstrative proof that at least God must be with him, as he has said, and they make it extremely doubtful whether he can be a bad man after all - can have verily broken the Divine Law." Such a speech as this from Pharisees is an emphatic proof of the profound effect produced by Jesus upon the life of the nation. It stands in close association with the remarkable statement of Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), "We know that no man can do these miracles (signs) which thou art doing, except God be with him." Jesus and rabbinism are here face to face. Either <span class="accented">he</span> is from God and <span class="accented">they</span> are actually making the Law of God void and vapid by their traditions, or they and their code are from God and he, having broken with them, has broken with God, and the miracle will turn out to he magic or falsehood, collusion or worse. Thus a solemn crisis of profound importance occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And there was a division</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, cutting into two parties) <span class="cmt_word">amongst them.</span> These opposite effects and conclusions are the confirmation of the words of the prologue (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 5, 11, 12</a>), and they further triumphantly refute the charge that the author of the Gospel was actuated by an untiring hostility to the kingdom and polity of the ancient Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
