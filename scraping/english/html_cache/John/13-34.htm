The term "new" indicates a fresh, unprecedented directive that emphasizes the transformative nature of Jesus' ministry. In the context of the Last Supper, this commandment is given as part of Jesus' farewell discourse, underscoring its importance as a foundational principle for His followers. The concept of a "new commandment" echoes the prophetic anticipation of a new covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>Love one another:</b><br>This commandment is central to Christian ethics and community life. The Greek word for love used here is "agape," which denotes selfless, sacrificial love. This type of love is not based on emotions or feelings but is an act of will, reflecting God's love for humanity. In the cultural context of the time, where social hierarchies and divisions were prevalent, this command to love one another was radical, promoting unity and equality among believers. This love is to be the defining characteristic of Jesus' disciples, as further emphasized in <a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>.<p><b>As I have loved you:</b><br>Jesus sets Himself as the ultimate example of love, pointing to His actions and teachings throughout His ministry. This phrase foreshadows His impending sacrifice on the cross, the ultimate demonstration of His love. The disciples had witnessed Jesus' love through His service, compassion, and forgiveness, providing them with a tangible model to emulate. This call to love as Jesus loved elevates the commandment to a divine standard, challenging believers to embody Christ-like love in their relationships.<p><b>So you also must love one another:</b><br>The repetition of the command to love one another reinforces its significance and necessity within the Christian community. This love is not optional but a mandate for all followers of Christ. It serves as a testament to their faith and a witness to the world, as seen in the early church's communal life in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. The imperative "must" indicates the non-negotiable nature of this command, urging believers to actively pursue love in their interactions, thus fulfilling the law of Christ as described in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this commandment, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' command.

In doing so, we display the transforming power of the new covenant and bear unmistakable witness to the Savior who first loved us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another.</span>--There is no reference in the context to the Ten Commandments, and we are not therefore to seek the meaning of the "new commandment" in any more or less full contrast with them. They also taught that a man should love his neighbour as himself; and the fulfilment of the law is love. The contrast here is between what our Lord had said unto the Jews and what He now says to the disciples. He had said, and says again, "Whither I go ye cannot come." To the Jews he added, "Ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins" (<a href="/context/john/7-34.htm" title="You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.">John 7:34-35</a>). For those who believe in Him, He has no such decree of separation, but a new and different commandment, by which His spiritual presence would be at once realised and proved. Love to one another, and therefore sacrifice of self for another's good, would be, in the truest sense, a realisation of His presence in their midst. (Comp. Note on <a href="/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.">1John 2:8</a>.)<p>For the meaning of the word "commandment," comp. Note on <a href="/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>.<p><span class= "bld">As I have loved you.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">Even as I loved you.</span> (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>.) The punctuation of our version is to be maintained. It is not, as it has sometimes been read, "That ye love one another, as I have loved you . . ." The earlier clause gives the principle of the new commandment. The latter clause repeats this, and prefaces the repetition by words referring to His own acts of love, which should be an example for them. The word "as," or "even as," does not refer to the degree of His love, but to the fact; and the special instance of love then present to the mind was the feet-washing upon which the whole of this discourse has followed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The demand which this glorification would make on the mutual fidelity and affection of the disciples</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new commandment I give unto you</span> (<span class="accented">with the purpose and scope</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that ye love one another; even as</span> (or, <span class="accented">seeing that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>I loved you, that ye</span> (<span class="accented">also</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>love one another</span>. The interpretation of this verse largely depends on the meaning given to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>, if, as many translate it, "even as I loved you;" or, "after the manner and type of my love to you;" then an amply sufficient explanation arises of the <span class="accented">novelty</span> of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. So new a type of love is given that, as the Greek expositors generally have urged, there is a deeper intensity in the love than can be found in the Mosaic principle, Love thy neighbor as <span class="accented">thyself</span>." In this commandment, which embraces the whole law, self-love is assumed, and is made the standard for the love of neighbor. This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, on the other hand, would be based on a new principle, and measured by a higher standard, and even mean more than love of self altogether. Christ's love to his disciples was self-abandoning, self-sacrificing love. This view of the passage is urged by Lucke, and really removes all necessity for the varied translations of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, such as "illustrious" (Hammond); "last" (Heumann); "one that is always new" (Olshausen); "renewed commandment," a "renewing commandment" (Augustine and Maldonatus); "the institution of the Eucharist" (Lange). But it is doubtful whether the ideal image of a perfect love constitutes the novelty, and whether the double <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> and the transposition of the second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> be found in the simple style of John. If, however, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> be taken as "seeing that," or "since I loved you" (see <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>), Christ's love becomes not so much the manner or type, as the motive, ground, and principle of love to one another. As if he had said, "I have loved each of you unto death; in loving one another you are loving me, you are loving an object of my tender love. The desire of mere imitation, however strong, is not equal to the demand I make, while the bestowment of the 'new' principle of life arising from a response to my love <span class="accented">is</span>." For the first interpretation speaks John's own use of the idea (<a href="/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>). There is a third interpretation, which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> a sentence parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. "Even as up to this moment, and up to my death, and to the uttermost, I have loved you, I <span class="accented">give</span>," etc., "<span class="accented">in</span> order that ye may love one another, and, inspired by me, may imitate my love one towards another" (Westcott). This is an endeavor to combine both interpretations. Alford suggests that the "newness" of the commandment consists in its "<span class="accented">unicity</span>," its being the prime injunction of the new covenant, and the first-fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>.). Tholuck sees the expression of self-renouncing love - the love of the highest to the sinful, the love which is more blessed to give than to receive, the all-embracing love. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/13-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A new</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kain&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2537.htm">Strong's 2537: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fresh, new, unused, novel.
