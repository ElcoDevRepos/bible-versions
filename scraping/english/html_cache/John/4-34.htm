His explanation comes in response to their urging Him to eat, highlighting His focus on spiritual matters over physical needs. This moment underscores Jesus' role as a teacher, often using everyday situations to impart deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>My food</b><br>Here, Jesus uses the metaphor of food to describe His sustenance and purpose. In the cultural context, food is essential for life, and by equating His mission to food, Jesus emphasizes the necessity and priority of His divine mission. This metaphor aligns with other scriptural instances where spiritual nourishment is prioritized, such as in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, where Jesus states that man shall not live by bread alone.<p><b>is to do the will of Him who sent Me</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' submission and obedience to God the Father. It reflects the Trinitarian relationship where the Son willingly fulfills the Father's plan. The concept of being "sent" is significant in the Gospel of John, emphasizing Jesus' divine mission and authority. This aligns with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speak of the Messiah being sent to accomplish God's purposes.<p><b>and to finish His work</b><br>Jesus speaks of completing the work given to Him by the Father, which includes His teachings, miracles, and ultimately, His sacrificial death and resurrection. This completion is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's redemptive role, such as in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The notion of finishing the work also foreshadows Jesus' declaration on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His earthly mission and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples about His mission and purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The region where this conversation takes place, significant for its cultural and religious tensions with the Jews.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, she is part of the broader account in <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, where Jesus reveals His identity and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_will_of_the_father.htm">The Will of the Father</a></b><br>Refers to God's divine plan and purpose, which Jesus is committed to fulfilling.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_nourishment.htm">Understanding Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that true sustenance comes from fulfilling God's will, not just physical food.

As He often does&#8212;see <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>&#8212;Jesus turns an everyday situation into a lesson on spiritual realities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My food</b><p>&#8226; Food sustains life, satisfies hunger, and brings strength.

Like physical food, doing the Father&#8217;s will sustains and satisfies Him. Obedience is His delight; accomplishing the mission is His nourishment. He is sent with authority, serves with joy, and finishes with victory&#8212;showing us that real life is found not in gratifying ourselves but in gladly yielding to God&#8217;s purpose until the work is done.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">My meat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">My food,</span> as before (<a href="/john/4-8.htm" title="(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)">John 4:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">To do the will. . . . to finish.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that I may do the will, . . . that I may finish.</span> These verbs point out the end which He ever kept in view.

(Comp. <a href="/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a>.)<p>This work He speaks of here, and in <a href="/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>, as a<span class= "ital">ctual food,</span> as the supply of the truest needs, and the satisfaction of the truest desires of His nature. (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.">Matthew 4:4</a>.) Analogies to this are within the limits of every man's experience, and, faint as they are, help us to learn something of what this spiritual sustenance was. The command of duty, the cheering power of hope, the stimulus of success, are forces that supply to weak and weary nerves and muscles, the vigour of a new life. Under them the soldier can forget his wounds, the martyr smile at the lion or the flame, the worn-out traveller still plod onward at the thought of home. We cannot analyse this power, but it exists. They have food to eat that those without know not of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to them, My food -</span> that which satisfies my strongest desire, and quenches all other desire - <span class="cmt_word">is that I may</span> <span class="cmt_word">do continuously</span> <span class="cmt_word">the will of him that sent me</span> on my mission to this people and to this world. "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God," was the motto and burden of his life. "Not my will, but thine," was the sacrificial cry which redeemed the world. To teach man to do the will of the Father is the motive which sustained him, and the prayer he put upon human lips was, "Thy will be done." Meyer here rightly says that <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is not equal to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. Some expression is given by it as to the <span class="accented">end</span> and purpose of the mysterious life of which we have these sacred illustrations. The doing of the will of God is a perpetual and sublime activity, a continuing, ceaseless purpose; while the completion of the work will be one consummating act, towards which all the daily doing of the will is a preparation, and of which, in some sense, every day we discern a prelibation and forthshadowing.
