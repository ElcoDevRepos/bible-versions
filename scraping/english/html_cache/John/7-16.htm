This statement reflects the humility and submission of Jesus to the Father, highlighting the unity and distinct roles within the Trinity. It contrasts with the teachings of the religious leaders of the time, who often relied on human tradition and interpretation. This assertion also aligns with the prophetic role of Jesus as the ultimate prophet, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, where God promises to raise up a prophet who will speak His words.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>The context of this reply is crucial. Jesus is responding to the astonishment and questioning of the Jewish leaders and the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. His response is a direct answer to their skepticism about His authority and the source of His wisdom. This setting in Jerusalem, a central place of Jewish worship and learning, underscores the significance of His declaration and the challenge it posed to the established religious order.<p><b>It comes from Him who sent Me.</b><br>Here, Jesus identifies God the Father as the source of His teachings, reinforcing His divine mission and authority. This statement is consistent with the theme throughout the Gospel of John, where Jesus frequently refers to being sent by the Father (e.g., <a href="/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23-24, 6</a>:38-39). It underscores the intimate relationship between the Father and the Son and the divine mandate of Jesus' ministry. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God sending messengers and prophets to His people, with Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of this pattern.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem.

Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a>). There is, then, no ground for their present wonder.
