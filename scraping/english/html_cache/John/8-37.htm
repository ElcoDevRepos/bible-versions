This reference to Abraham is significant because it connects to the covenant God made with Abraham, promising that his descendants would be numerous and blessed (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The Jewish identity is deeply rooted in this patriarchal lineage, and being a descendant of Abraham was a source of pride and religious identity. However, Jesus is about to challenge the notion that physical descent alone is sufficient for true kinship with Abraham.<p><b>but you are trying to kill Me</b><br>Despite their heritage, Jesus points out the contradiction in their actions. The desire to kill Jesus reveals a spiritual disconnect from the faith and righteousness of Abraham, who was known for his obedience and faith in God (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). This accusation highlights the growing tension between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, who saw Him as a threat to their authority and traditions. Historically, this reflects the increasing opposition Jesus faced during His ministry, leading to His eventual crucifixion.<p><b>because My word has no place within you</b><br>Jesus identifies the root cause of their hostility: a rejection of His teachings. The "word" refers to the message of the Gospel, which includes repentance, faith, and the coming of God's kingdom. The phrase suggests a spiritual blindness or hardness of heart, as seen in other parts of Scripture where people are unable to accept divine truth (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). This rejection is not just intellectual but moral and spiritual, indicating a lack of receptivity to God's revelation. The inability to accept Jesus' word contrasts with the faith of Abraham, who listened to and obeyed God's voice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders and people who are questioning His authority and teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Jewish nation, revered as the father of faith.

This seems unnatural, and is opposed to the words which immediately follow. As a party, they had been, and still were, seeking to kill Him. These believers, by their question in <a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>, were showing the spirit which declined discipleship, were identifying themselves with His opponents. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, I know absolutely, I do not come to know it from your retort) <span class="cmt_word">that ye are the seed of Abraham.</span> They belonged to the noble race, "whose are the fathers;" they were the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of him who received the promises. Christ admitted the pedigree, but he proceeds to show that mere hereditary descent would be of no avail to them apart from moral considerations. These ideas, these revolutionary conceptions, so far as Judaism was concerned, were not the evolution of Christian ideas in the second century. It is most instructive to see how clearly St. Paul had already grasped them, and woven them into a powerful argument when dealing with the Judaizers in Galatia, many years before this Gospel was written (see the entire argument of <a href="/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, which thus rests on the teaching of the Christ himself). <span class="cmt_word">But ye seek to kill me.</span> This charge is certainly difficult to suppose applicable to those who "had come to believe in him" (ver. 31). One of three suppositions must be made - either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the believing Jews were surrounded by angry groups of his bitter enemies, to whom he here addressed himself; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the Lord spoke here to them as representing the large company of Jerusalem opponents, whom he knew at that moment to be planning his death, and as all orators and debaters are in the habit of dealing with opposing arguments by showing the character they assume in others, who make them their boast; or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> those who had come to believe him up to a certain point had as rapidly relapsed, at the first touch of spiritual proof, into disbelief and cruel hostility. This seems the more natural interpretation of the fact, which may, at the same time, have become patent from some angry manifestation of his implacable foes. There is much to be found in the background and scenery of this dramatic colloquy, reported with such extreme brevity, which would, if we exactly knew how to paint it, solve its difficulties. Ye seek to slay me, <span class="cmt_word">because my word</span> - the word which is mine - <span class="cmt_word">makes no progress</span> - or, <span class="accented">advance</span> - <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in you.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> has both transitive and intransitive meanings; thus it means "leave," "depart," "turn," or "come to," with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, "contain;" <a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>; <a href="/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>); but it has the force frequently in Plato "to make progress or advance," and it has this force here. So Meyer, Westcott, R.T., etc. (Luthardt and Tholuck suggest "find entrance," which would require <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>). Not only did they not <span class="accented">continue</span> in Christ's word (ver. 31), but the word itself made no way in their minds; it was barred out by prejudices, and thus choked at its very first working. Christ thus represents his word first as the very atmosphere and home in which his true disciples abide, and then as a powerful influence which grows evermore in power and command as it is pondered. It means more and more to those who abide in it; it implicitly contains a whole universe of truth and reality, of impulse and motive, for those who allow to it "free course" - who are of the truth, and hear his voice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(este)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
