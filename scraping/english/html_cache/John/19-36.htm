The Gospel of John emphasizes that the occurrences during the crucifixion were not random but part of a divine plan. The phrase underscores the sovereignty of God in orchestrating events to fulfill His purposes. The crucifixion, a central event in Christian theology, is seen as the culmination of God's redemptive plan for humanity.<p><b>so that the Scripture would be fulfilled:</b><br>This highlights the importance of prophecy in the biblical narrative. The fulfillment of Scripture is a recurring theme in the New Testament, demonstrating that Jesus' life and death were in accordance with Old Testament prophecies. This phrase assures readers that the events of Jesus' crucifixion were anticipated and foretold by the prophets, reinforcing the divine inspiration and authority of Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;Not one of His bones will be broken.&#8221;</b><br>This is a direct reference to Old Testament prophecy, specifically <a href="/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a>, which states, "He protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken." Additionally, it echoes the instructions for the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>, where it is commanded that no bones of the sacrificial lamb should be broken. This connection establishes Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice brings deliverance from sin. The unbroken bones symbolize the perfection and completeness of His sacrifice, fulfilling the typology of the Passover lamb and affirming Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, whose crucifixion and the events surrounding it fulfill Old Testament prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>They carried out the crucifixion and were responsible for breaking the legs of those crucified, but did not break Jesus' legs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was crucified, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_lamb.htm">Passover Lamb</a></b><br>The reference to "not one of His bones will be broken" connects Jesus to the Passover lamb, which was not to have any broken bones according to Jewish law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_testament_prophecy.htm">Old Testament Prophecy</a></b><br>The fulfillment of Scripture is a key theme, specifically referencing prophecies from the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' life and death were in perfect alignment with Old Testament prophecies, affirming the divine plan and sovereignty of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_passover_lamb.htm">Symbolism of the Passover Lamb</a></b><br>Jesus is the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice brings deliverance from sin, just as the original Passover lambs signified deliverance from Egypt.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_purpose.htm">Divine Protection and Purpose</a></b><br>The fact that Jesus' bones were not broken, despite the common practice of breaking the legs of the crucified, highlights God's protection and the fulfillment of His purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Believers can trust that God's plans are perfect and will be fulfilled, even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_sacrificial_love.htm">Christ's Sacrificial Love</a></b><br>Reflect on the depth of Christ's love and sacrifice, which was foretold and fulfilled for our redemption.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_19_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 19:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_19_36_and_OT_prophecy_link.htm">How does John 19:36 fulfill Old Testament prophecy about Jesus' crucifixion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_no_broken_bones_significant.htm">Why is it significant that "not one of His bones will be broken"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/John_19_36_God_s_control_in_Jesus_death.htm">What does John 19:36 reveal about God's sovereignty in Jesus' death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_promises_in_John_19_36.htm">How can we trust God's promises as seen in John 19:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_19_36_s_role_in_faith_s_reliability.htm">How does John 19:36 strengthen our faith in Scripture's reliability?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_19_36_fulfill_prophecy.htm">How does John 19:36 fulfill Old Testament prophecy about Jesus' crucifixion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_John_19_36_s_bone_unbroken.htm">Why is the unbroken bone significant in John 19:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/John_19_36_God_s_control_in_Jesus_death_2.htm">What does John 19:36 reveal about God's sovereignty in Jesus' death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_blood_and_water_flow.htm">Why did Jesus' side release blood and water?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_unbelief.htm">What does the Bible say about unbelief?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_the_righteous_suffer_if_god_protects.htm">How does Psalm 34 claim God protects the righteous (Psalm 34:19&#8211;20) if historical records show many righteous individuals still suffer or die?

(Comp.

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1Corinthians 5:7</a>). It is not equally apposite to refer to <a href="/psalms/34-20.htm" title="He keeps all his bones: not one of them is broken.">Psalm 34:20</a>, as the thought there is of preservation in life, but the words of the Psalm are doubtless themselves a poetic adaptation of the words of Exodus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For these things came to pass, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> Both the omission of the crurifragium, and the piercing of the Redeemer's side, with its solemn and strange issues, confirm to this great eye-witness the spiritual meaning and Messianic portraiture involved in them. A bone of him shall not be broken. This quotation from the ceremonial of the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-46.htm">Exodus 12:46</a>; <a href="/numbers/9-12.htm">Numbers 9:12</a>), where the lamb offered to God was to be shielded from unnecessary mutilation, is in harmony with the words of the Baptist, "Behold the Lamb of God!" and with Paul's language (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," and shows that the Fourth Gospel does recognize this parallel, which is in a very remarkable way thus quietly reaffirmed. This passage acquires meaning from the supposition that the Jews were hurrying away to eat their Paschal lamb, not a bone of which could be legally broken. The opponents of the authenticity think that incidents are invented to establish the supposed relationship. Those who seek to reply to them by explaining away this reference to the Passover think that <a href="/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a> is referred to, "He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken;" but the force of that passage in this connection would violently clash with any such adaptation of it as could make it refer to the cruel and violent death of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
