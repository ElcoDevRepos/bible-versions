In biblical times, wind was often associated with divine activity, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the Spirit of God is described as moving over the waters. The Greek word for "wind" (pneuma) is the same as for "spirit," emphasizing the connection. The wind's freedom to move as it pleases reflects the Spirit's ability to work beyond human understanding or control.<p><b>You hear its sound,</b><br>The sound of the wind is perceptible, yet invisible, much like the effects of the Holy Spirit's work in a person's life. This aligns with the biblical theme that faith comes by hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The Spirit's presence is evidenced by transformation and the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>), which are observable even if the Spirit Himself is not seen.<p><b>but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going.</b><br>This phrase underscores the mystery and divine nature of the Spirit's work. Just as the origins and destination of the wind are unknown, so too are the ways of the Spirit. This reflects the biblical principle that God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The Spirit's work is not bound by human limitations or expectations.<p><b>So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&#8221;</b><br>Being "born of the Spirit" refers to the concept of spiritual rebirth or regeneration, a central theme in Christian theology. This new birth is necessary to enter the kingdom of God, as Jesus explains earlier in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>. The transformation brought about by the Spirit is profound and life-changing, akin to a new creation (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This spiritual rebirth is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about the nature of being born again and the work of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council who comes to Jesus at night seeking understanding about His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to metaphorically as the wind, the Holy Spirit's work in regeneration and transformation is a key theme in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this conversation takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wind.htm">The Wind</a></b><br>Used as a metaphor for the Holy Spirit, illustrating the mysterious and sovereign nature of the Spirit's work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_the_spirit.htm">The Sovereignty of the Spirit</a></b><br>Just as the wind cannot be controlled or fully understood, the Holy Spirit operates according to God's sovereign will.

Though we cannot control or fully comprehend the Spirit&#8217;s movements, we can trust His sovereign grace, expect tangible change, and follow wherever He leads.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof.</span>--Better (see Note below), <span class= "ital">the Spirit breatheth where He willeth, and thou hearest His voice.</span> These words are an explanation of the spiritual birth, the necessity of which has been asserted in the previous verses. They must have come to Nicodemus, bringing in their sound echoes of the old familiar words, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul" (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>). These words would bring to the mind thoughts of the human body, cold, lifeless, corpse-like; of the breath of life passing into it; of the beating pulse, the opening eye, the action of nerve, muscle, and limb, as, in obedience to God's will, matter became the framework of spirit, and man became a living soul. There are parallel thoughts of the spirit existing in capacity for life and union with God, but crushed beneath the physical life with its imperative demands for support, and the sensible life with its engrossing pleasures and pains, and sorrows and joys; of the Spirit of God breathing upon it; and of the dormant power awakening into a new life of noblest thoughts and hopes and energies, when man is born of the Spirit.<p>And yet the new spiritual birth, like the physical, cannot be explained. We can observe the phenomena, we cannot trace the principle of life. He breatheth where He willeth, in the wide world of man, free as the wind of heaven, bound by no limits of country or of race. The voice is heard speaking to the man himself, and through him to others; there is the evidence of the new birth in the new life. We know not whence He comes, or whither He goes. We cannot fix the day or hour of the new birth with certainty. We know not what its final issues will be. It is the beginning of a life which is a constant growth, and the highest development here is but the germ of that which shall be hereafter (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span>--The sense is, <span class= "ital">In this manner is every one </span>(<span class= "ital">born</span>)<span class= "ital"> who is born of the Spirit.</span> The universality is again emphatically asserted. Individual spiritual life depends upon individual spiritual birth. The baptism of the Spirit is needed for all. Now, indeed, coming as a fire burning in men's hearts, consuming the chaff of sin, while He purifies and stores up all that is true and good; now coming as in a moment, and arresting a man in a course of evil, revealing the iniquity of sin, and giving the power to reform; now coming as the gradual dawning of day upon the youthful soul who has never been wholly without it; here in a sermon or a prayer, there in the lessons of childhood; now by the example of a noble life or the lessons of history; again in the study of Scripture or the truths written on the page of nature--the Spirit breatheth where it willeth. We may not limit His action, but by His action must every one be born again. Comp. the instances of what men call gradual conversion and sudden conversion, placed side by side in the same chapter, in <a href="/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>; <a href="/acts/16-29.htm" title="Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,">Acts 16:29</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span><p>The rendering of the first clause of this verse by the <span class= "ital">Spirit breatheth</span> for "wind bloweth" of the Authorised version has met with so little support that it is right to state briefly the grounds on which it rests. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wind bloweth</span> (<span class="accented">the Spirit breathes</span>, Revised Version, in margin) <span class="cmt_word">where it willeth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and thou hearest</span> (his voice) <span class="cmt_word">the sound thereof, but thou knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth.</span> Vulgate (followed by Wickliffe and the Rheims Versions) is, <span class="accented">Spiritus ubi vult spirat et vocem ejus audis, sed nescis unde veniat, aut quo vadat</span>: <span class="accented">sic est omnis qui natus est ex Spiritu.</span> Augustine, though acquainted with the other rendering, approves of this; so Origen, Bengel. The great majority of commentators and versions have held that the former of the two translations is correct; that the first time the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used, it refers to the wind, "the unseen similitude of God the Spirit - his most meet and mightiest sign;" and that, since the same word is used for the two things, Spirit and wind, the Lord, after the parabolic manner which he adopted (in the synoptic Gospels), took advantage of some gusts of roaring wind then audible, to call attention to the mystery and incomprehensibility of its origin or end, and to see a parallel between the unknown ways of the wind and the unknown points of application to the human spirit of the mighty energy of the living God. The passage, <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, may have been in his mind (though there "Spirit" is as likely to be the reference as is the motion of the "wind," and our ignorance of the way of the Spirit is akin to our ignorance of the formation of bones in the womb of her who is with child), and the adoption of the unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> (cf. <a href="/john/6-18.htm">John 6:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-25.htm">Matthew 7:25</a>; <a href="/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a>) is in support of the comparison between "wind" and the "Spirit;" while the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, the "voice" or sound of the wind in trees or against any barriers, and the other effects that the rapid motion of the air produces, gives a lively illustration of the method in which the Spirit of God works in human minds, revealing, not itself, but its effects. The parallel is not peculiar to Scripture (see the remarkable passage in Xenophon, 'Memor.,' 4:3-14; also 'Rig Veda,' 10:168). It is further urged that the following clause, <span class="cmt_word">So is every one that hath been born</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the Spirit</span> - meaning, <span class="accented">So doth it happen to every one who is born of the Spirit</span> - suggests the analogy between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in its material sense, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in its customary and deeper sense. Now, on the other hand, it appears to me that this latter clause is compatible with the older translation and application. There <span class="accented">is</span> a comparison, but it may be between the mysterious working, breathing of the Divine Spirit, whose "voice" or "word" may be heard, whose effects are present to our senses and consciousness, but the beginnings and endings of which are always lost in God, - and the special operations of Divine grace in the <span class="accented">birth</span> of the Spirit. There are numberless operations of the Spirit referred to in the Old Testament, from the first brooding of the Spirit on the formless abyss, to all the special and mighty effects wrought in creation, all the heightening and quickening of human faculty, all the conference of special strength upon men - their intellectual energies and Divine inspirations. Over and above all these, there is all the supernatural change wrought in souls by the Holy Spirit. Christ calls <span class="accented">this</span> a "birth of the Spirit," and declares that, according to all the mysterious comings and departings of the Spirit, leaving only manifold effects, so is the special Divine work which morally and spiritually recreates humanity. <span class="accented">Pneuma</span> is used three hundred and fifty times in the New Testament, and twenty times in this Gospel for "the Spirit;" and if the usage is reversed here, this is the solitary occasion. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, is, moreover, more appropriate to a living Being than to the wind. There is another way which suggests itself by which the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> may mean the same in both clauses: <span class="accented">The breath of God bloweth where it listeth</span>, etc., <span class="accented">so is every one born of the breath of God.</span> If this be possible, the form of the expression supplies a cooperating similitude drawn from the unknown origin and mighty effects of the unseen breath of heaven; and on this translation the comparison is drawn between all the ways of the Spirit and the special work of the Spirit in regeneration. An inference is deducible from either interpretation of this verse, incompatible with the theory that "birth from water" is equivalent to "regeneration in baptism." If the rite of baptism provided the moment and occasion of the spiritual result, we <span class="accented">should</span> know whence it came and whither it went. We might not know "how," but we should know "when" and "whence" the spiritual change took place. But this knowledge is distinctly negatived by Christ, who herein declares the moment of the spiritual birth to be lost or hidden in God. Physical birth is a deep mystery, both whence the "spirit" comes and whither it goes; the signs of the presence of life are abundant, but there is an infinite difference between the stillborn or dead child and the living one. Similarly, the commencement of the Spirit's creation within our nature is lost in mystery. We discern its presence by its effects, by consciousness of a new life and sense of a new world all around the newly born, but the Spirit-birth, like all the other operations of the Spirit, is hidden in God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
