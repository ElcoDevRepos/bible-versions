This moment underscores the divine orchestration of events, as the disciples arrive just as the conversation concludes, allowing the woman to leave and spread the news about Jesus. The return of the disciples also marks a transition from a private dialogue to a more public revelation of Jesus' mission.<p><b>and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman.</b><br>In the cultural context of first-century Judea, it was unusual for a Jewish man, especially a rabbi, to engage in conversation with a woman in public. This surprise is heightened by the fact that the woman is a Samaritan, a group generally despised by Jews due to historical and religious animosities. The disciples' reaction highlights the radical nature of Jesus' ministry, which often broke social norms to reach marginalized individuals.<p><b>But no one asked Him, &#8220;What do You want from her?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' silence may indicate their respect for Jesus' authority and wisdom, even when His actions defy their expectations. It also suggests an internal struggle to understand His unconventional approach. This phrase reflects the disciples' growing awareness that Jesus' mission transcends traditional boundaries and expectations.<p><b>or &#8220;Why are You talking with her?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores the cultural and religious barriers that Jesus is breaking. By speaking with the Samaritan woman, Jesus demonstrates His mission to seek and save the lost, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or social status.

Their timing is no accident; God&#8217;s providence repeatedly places His servants exactly where they need to be (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>; <a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; They had gone to Sychar to buy food (<a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>). While they were away, Jesus revealed His identity to the Samaritan woman. The disciples&#8217; return signals a transition from a one-on-one encounter to a lesson for the whole group, similar to the shift that happens in <a href="/mark/5-33.htm">Mark 5:33&#8211;34</a> after the woman with the issue of blood meets Jesus.<p>&#8226; The literal wording &#8220;Just then&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s timetable is precise. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a> notes that Christ came &#8220;when the time had fully come,&#8221; and the same principle governs the smaller moments of His ministry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman.</b><p>&#8220;and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman&#8221;.<p>&#8226; First-century norms discouraged rabbis from public conversation with women, especially alone (cf. <a href="/luke/7-39.htm">Luke 7:39</a>). In addition, Samaritans were viewed by Jews as ceremonially unclean (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is not breaking the Law; He is breaking human barriers. By engaging this woman, He foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s reach &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>) and models the truth that &#8220;there is neither Jew nor Greek&#8230; male nor female&#8221; in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Their surprise exposes cultural prejudice that still needed correction&#8212;prejudice Jesus would address again when He welcomed Mary of Bethany to sit at His feet as a learner (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But no one asked Him, &#8220;What do You want from her?&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;Yet no one said, &#8216;What do You seek?&#8217;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Respect silences them.

Earlier they questioned Him about feeding the crowd (<a href="/mark/6-37.htm">Mark 6:37</a>) and about cleansing the temple (<a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>), but here they hold their peace. The closer we walk with the Lord, the more readily we defer to His wisdom.<p>&#8226; It also spares the woman embarrassment; Jesus&#8217; followers are called to cover, not expose, the vulnerable (<a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or &#8220;Why are You talking with her?&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;or, &#8216;Why are You talking with her?&#8217;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Their unasked question highlights the radical nature of Jesus&#8217; mission: He initiates relationship with those considered outcasts (<a href="/matthew/9-12.htm">Matthew 9:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of interrogation, the disciples soon witness the fruit of the conversation&#8212;the woman&#8217;s testimony draws many in Sychar to believe (<a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39&#8211;42</a>). God often invites us to watch silently while He works, then join in the harvest.<p>&#8226; The moment anticipates later scenes where the disciples again choose silence in awe (<a href="/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>) and underscores the importance of honoring Christ&#8217;s authority even when we do not immediately understand His methods (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a> captures the precise instant when Jesus&#8217; private ministry to a Samaritan woman intersects with His public training of the Twelve.

They would like to ask Him, as He asked some of them (<a href="/john/1-38.htm" title="Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you?

"speakest" with "I that speak," in the last verse); but there is already a sense of the reverence due to Him, which checks the question as it rises to the lip.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-38.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Revelation and misunderstanding involved in the conduct of the disciples.</span> The next paragraph records the effects of this conversation upon the disciples, upon the woman herself, and upon her friends. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hereupon his disciples came;</span> they returned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those of them who had gone to Sychar, bringing their provisions and their <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> with them, <span class="cmt_word">and they marvelled</span> <span class="cmt_word">that he was talking with a woman</span>. Such a proceeding was contrary to the etiquette of a rabbi, who contended that "a man should not salute a woman in a public place, not even his own wife" (cf. Lightfoot, Edersheim, Wettstein). One of the daily thanksgivings was, "Blessed art thou, O Lord... who hast not made me a woman" (Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span> (adds the eyewitness, one intimately acquainted with the innermost sentiments of the disciples) <span class="cmt_word">no one said, What seekest thou?

They marvelled (or, if we take the R.T., <span class="accented">they kept marvelling</span>) <span class="accented">at</span> the unwonted scene, that One so great as their Rabbi and Master should condescend to teach or converse with a woman at all; but they held their peace, with the conviction that what he did must be gracious, holy, and wise. One of the miracles of the Lord's ministry was to break down the wretched rabbinical prejudice against the spiritual capacities of woman, and the Oriental folly which supposed that she contaminated their sanctity. He lifted woman to her true position by the side of man. Women were his most faithful disciples. They ministered unto him of their substance. They shared his miraculous healing, feeding, and teaching. They anointed his feet, they wept over his agony, they followed him to the cross, they were early at the sepulchre. They greeted him as the risen Lord. They received the baptism of the Spirit. In Christ there is neither male nor female.
