The disciples often struggled to understand Jesus' teachings, which were sometimes conveyed in parables or symbolic language. Their response here shows a moment of clarity and understanding. This interaction takes place during the Last Supper, a significant event in the Gospel narrative, where Jesus prepares His disciples for His impending death and resurrection.<p><b>See, now You are speaking plainly</b><br>The disciples express relief and appreciation for Jesus' clear communication. Throughout His ministry, Jesus used parables and metaphors to convey deeper spiritual truths (e.g., <a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>). Here, He speaks directly about His relationship with the Father and the coming of the Holy Spirit, which is crucial for the disciples' understanding of their mission after His departure. This moment foreshadows the clarity and understanding they will receive through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>and without figures of speech.</b><br>Figures of speech, such as parables and allegories, were common in Jesus' teachings. They served to reveal truths to those open to understanding while concealing them from those who were not (<a href="/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11-12</a>). The disciples' recognition of Jesus speaking plainly signifies a pivotal moment in their spiritual journey, as they begin to grasp the reality of His mission and the nature of His kingdom.

Here, their quick acknowledgment shows:<p>&#8226; A readiness to believe what He has just declared (compare <a href="/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>).<p>&#8226; A fellowship setting where honest dialogue with Christ is welcomed (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>, &#8220;I have called you friends&#8221;).<p>Their words remind us that genuine discipleship involves responding to the Lord&#8217;s revelations with open hearts, even when full understanding is still forming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See</b><p>The little word &#8220;See&#8221; (or &#8220;Behold&#8221; in some translations) signals an awakening moment:<p>&#8226; They think clarity has finally dawned.
