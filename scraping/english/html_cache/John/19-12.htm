Pilate, aware of Jesus' innocence (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>), sought to avoid condemning Him. This reflects the Roman legal system's emphasis on justice, yet Pilate's actions also reveal his fear of unrest. Historically, Pilate's tenure as governor was marked by tension with the Jewish population, making him cautious of any potential uprising. This phrase underscores Pilate's struggle between justice and political expediency.<p><b>but the Jews kept shouting</b><br>The Jewish leaders' persistent demands for Jesus' crucifixion demonstrate their rejection of Him as the Messiah. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' rejection by His own people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>. The leaders' insistence also highlights the tension between Jewish expectations of a political Messiah and Jesus' spiritual mission. The crowd's shouting indicates the intensity of the situation, as public opinion could sway Roman decisions.<p><b>&#8220;If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar.</b><br>The Jewish leaders' appeal to Pilate's loyalty to Caesar is a strategic move, leveraging Roman political dynamics. The title "friend of Caesar" was an honorific for those loyal to the emperor, and any suggestion of disloyalty could have severe consequences for Pilate. This phrase reveals the leaders' manipulation, using political pressure to achieve their goal. It also reflects the broader theme of earthly power versus divine authority, as Pilate is caught between his duty to Rome and the truth of Jesus' innocence.<p><b>Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.&#8221;</b><br>This accusation against Jesus is a distortion of His claim to be the King of the Jews. The Jewish leaders present Jesus as a political threat to Rome, knowing this would alarm Pilate. Historically, Roman authorities were vigilant against any potential insurrection, making this charge particularly serious. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of Jesus as the true King, whose kingdom is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). It also highlights the irony of the situation: Jesus, the true King, is rejected and condemned by those He came to save.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who is faced with the decision of whether to release Jesus or to crucify Him.

Pilate, convinced of Jesus&#8217; innocence, seeks release, yet political pressure and fear of Rome trap him. The crowd manipulates loyalty to Caesar to force a verdict against the true King. The verse reminds us that allegiance to Christ will often collide with worldly expectations, but His kingdom, though not of this world, is forever sovereign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him.</span>--The words may be interpreted of time, as in the Authorised version, or of cause--"For this reason Pilate sought to release Him." The latter is more probable, as the reference seems to be to the attempt which he made at once. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/6-66.htm" title="From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.">John 6:66</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend. . . .</span>--There was another weapon left in the armoury of their devices, against which no Roman governor was proof. The jealous fear of Tiberius had made "treason" a crime, of which the accusation was practically the proof, and the proof was death. The pages of Tacitus and Suetonius abound with examples of ruin wreaked on families in the name of the "law of treason." (Comp. Merivale: <span class= "ital">History of the Romans under the Empire,</span> vol. v., p. 143 <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) Here was One who had claimed to be a king, and Pilate was seeking to release Him. They knew, indeed, that it was a claim to be "king" in a sense widely different from any which would have affected the empire of Caesar; but Pilate has refused to condemn Him on the political charge without formal trial, and he has refused to accept their own condemnation of Jesus on the charge of blasphemy. He dare not refuse the force of an appeal which says that he is not Caesar's friend, and suggests an accusation against himself at Rome. See Note on <a href="/matthew/27-2.htm" title="And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.">Matthew 27:2</a> for the special reasons which would lead Pilate to dread such an accusation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-16.</span> - (g) Pilate vanquished by his selfish fears, and judgment given. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon this</span> [Revised Version (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); not from this moment, or "henceforth," as in the English Version, but in consequence of this statement and apportionment of blame, and not from any appreciation on Pilate's part of the Divine Sonship which Jesus had admitted without further definition] - upon this <span class="cmt_word">Pilate sought</span> (imperfect tense, suggesting repetition and incompleteness in the act) <span class="cmt_word">to release him</span>. We are not told by what means, and we have no right to introduce the additional notion of "peremptorily," or "the more," but that he made some further steps in the direction of resistance to the will of "the Jews." Baur and others think that the author is, from doctrinal grounds by mere fabrication, emphasizing the hostility of the Jews, and prolonging the agony of a vain attempt. Every one of these vivid touches impresses us with the unintentional indication of the eye-witness. Probably the governor proceeded to give the order of release; beckoned his body-guard to remove our Lord to a place of safety, and took some obvious steps to screen him from the malice and envy of his tormentors. <span class="cmt_word">But the Jews</span>, catching sight of the process, and imagining some maneuver to baulk them of their prey, revealed a spirit that has sometimes, but rarely, disgraced humanity: they dropped their religious plea, they smothered their affected loyalty for their ancient Law, and, having no further charge to bring against Jesus, hid their most intense hatred of Roman rule by assuming the mask of loyal subjection to Tiberius and to the majesty of the Caesar. They endeavored to work upon the fears of Pilate, who knew perfectly well that his position and life were at jeopardy if the matter stood as they pretended. With unscrupulous abandonment of all their patriotic boasts, the men who hated Rome and were perpetually plotting against the imperial power, <span class="cmt_word">exclaimed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, shouted with harsh loud yells of bitter hate, that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> rang for half a century in the ears of the loved and faithful disciple), <span class="cmt_word">If thou release this Man, thou art not Caesar's friend</span>. The friendship and confidence of Caesar was the title in their hearts to an unresting hatred and loathing; yet they are cunning enough to know that Tiberius was jealous of his own authority, and no charge was so fatal to a Roman procurator as crimen majestatis (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 3:38). Amiens Caesaris was a title of honor given to provincial governors, and sometimes to allies of the Caesar; but (as Alford, Meyer, and Westcott think) on this occasion it was used in wider sense, and was capable of a mere deadly emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">Every one who maketh himself</span> <span class="cmt_word">a king speaketh against</span> (declares himself opposed to, rebels against) <span class="cmt_word">Caesar</span>. As if that was likely to distress these maddened fanatics; and as if the very charge had not been already deliberately laughed to scorn by both Herod and Pilate. There was a Man who said he was a King, and Pilate was guilty of misprision of treason. Pilate's political history aggravated his fears. His relations with the emperor were not satisfactory (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:03. 1,2; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 2-4; cf. <a href="/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1</a>), and his knowledge of the power of these Jews to renew partisan and patriotic charges against him was now a very serious danger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">From then on,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(Ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
