The "her" refers to Mary, the sister of Lazarus, who is mourning her brother's death. Jesus' response to her weeping demonstrates His deep emotional connection to humanity. This moment reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." It underscores the humanity of Jesus, who, though divine, fully participates in human emotions.<p><b>and the Jews who had come with her also weeping</b><br>The presence of the Jews indicates the communal nature of mourning in Jewish culture. In first-century Judea, mourning was a public and communal event, often involving professional mourners. This cultural practice is evident in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17-18</a>, where wailing women are called upon to lament. The Jews' participation in the mourning process shows the close-knit community and the shared grief over Lazarus's death, emphasizing the impact of his loss.<p><b>He was deeply moved in spirit</b><br>The phrase "deeply moved" can be translated from the Greek word "embrimaomai," which conveys a sense of strong emotion, often associated with indignation or anger. This suggests that Jesus' reaction was not just sadness but a profound disturbance at the effects of sin and death in the world. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>, where creation is described as groaning under the weight of sin. Jesus' response here foreshadows His ultimate victory over death through His resurrection.<p><b>and troubled</b><br>The term "troubled" indicates an inner turmoil or agitation. This reflects Jesus' awareness of the spiritual battle against sin and death. It connects to His later experience in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He is described as being "sorrowful and troubled" (<a href="/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37-38</a>). This emotional response highlights the cost of redemption and the depth of Jesus' love for humanity, as He prepares to demonstrate His power over death by raising Lazarus and ultimately through His own resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who demonstrates both His divine power and human emotions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The sister of Lazarus, who is mourning the death of her brother.

It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.">John 11:38</a>, three times in the New Testament; in <a href="/matthew/9-30.htm" title="And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straightly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.">Matthew 9:30</a> ("and Jesus straitly charged them"); <a href="/mark/1-43.htm" title="And he straightly charged him, and immediately sent him away;">Mark 1:43</a> ("and He straitly charged him"); and <a href="/mark/14-5.htm" title="For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.">Mark 14:5</a> ("and they murmured against her"). Comp. Notes at these places. The original meaning of the word is "to snort, as of horses." Passing to the moral sense, it expresses disturbance of the mind--vehement agitation. This may express itself in sharp admonition, in words of anger against a person, or in a physical shudder, answering to the intensity of the emotion. In each of the passages in the earlier Gospels the word is accompanied by an object upon which the feeling is directed. In the present context it does not go beyond the subject of the feeling. Here it is "in the spirit" (comp. <a href="/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a>); and in <a href="/john/11-38.htm" title="Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.">John 11:38</a> it is "in Himself." Both mean the same thing; and point to the inner moral depth of His righteous indignation; the object of it, however, is not expressed. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-44.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The <span class="accented">struggle with death</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus therefore saw her walling, and the Jews wailing who came with her, he was moved with indignation in the spirit, and troubled himself.</span> The sight of the wailing Mary and the wailing Jews, who took up her grief and, according to Oriental custom, adopted her expression of it with loud cries and emphatic gestures, praising the dead, and lamenting his loss, produced a most wonderful impression on the Lord Jesus. Meyer thinks that the contrast between their hypocritical or professional tears and her genuine emotion, the blending of these incongruous elements, the combination of a profound affliction of a dear friend and the simulated grief of his bitter enemies, led him to manifest the feeling here described. But we have no right to import such an element into the scene. The concerted wailing was, however, the occasion of what is described in very remarkable terms, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The first expression occurs again in ver. 38. Westcott says in the three places where it elsewhere occurs (<a href="/matthew/9-30.htm">Matthew 9:30</a>; <a href="/mark/1-43.htm">Mark 1:43</a>; <a href="/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a>) there is "the notion of coercion arising out of displeasure," a motion "towards another of anger rather than sorrow." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and its compounds is used in the classics and the LXX. in the sense of hot anger, neither pain nor grief (though it is not very evident that it goes so far as this in <a href="/mark/1-43.htm">Mark 1:43</a>). Luther translated it <span class="accented">ergrimmete</span>, and Passow gives no other meaning. This seems generally accepted. But at what was Jesus angered? This can be answered only by deciding whether <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is the dative of the object, or whether it is the instrument or sphere of his holy indignation. According to the old Greek expositors, Origen, Chrysostom, Cyril, Theophylact - and they are followed by Alford and Hilgenfeld, the latter of whom finds in it a hint of the Gnostic Christology which, in his opinion, pervades the Gospel - the anger might have been directed against his own human spirit, at that moment tempted into an unfilial strain of sympathy with the mourners; yet, if this be its meaning, why was it that Jesus subsequently wept himself? and why, instead of exciting himself, instead of shuddering with his bitterness of feeling, did he not (as Hengstenberg says) compose and quiet himself? Beside, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span> would have been a far more appropriate term to use for the effective and sympathetic part of his nature than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. It is possible, if "the spirit" <span class="accented">expresses</span> that part of his human nature in special fellowship with the Father, to suppose that he felt a certain antagonism with that within himself which had prompted to some immediate manifestation of Divine power, and to translate, "<span class="accented">He</span> sternly checked his spirit." But the miracle of Divine struggle with death followed so immediately that this cannot be the true explanation (Westcott suggests it as an alternative, but not the best interpretation). The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, must be the sphere of his holy wrath, for which we must find some explanation. Meyer's seems (as already said) to be altogether insufficient. So also in our opinion is that of Godet, viz. that this act of victorious conflict with death, on which he was entering, involved his own death-warrant by being the occasion of the last outbreak of malice on the part of the Jews. Such a fact would be out of harmony, not only with the Fourth Gospel, but with the (synoptic) struggle in Gethsemane. Now, without enumerating various other interpretations of the passage, we think Augustine, Erasmus, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Moulton, meet our difficulty by the suggestion that death itself occasioned this indignation. Though, like the good Physician in the house of mourning, he knew the issue of his mighty act, yet he entered with vivid and intense human sympathy into all the primary and secondary sorrows of death. He saw the long procession of mourners from the first to the last, all the reckless agony, all the hopelessness of it, in thousands of millions of instances. There flashed upon his spirit all the terrible moral consequences of which death was the ghastly symbol. lie knew that within a short time he too, in taking upon himself the sins of men, would have taken upon himself their death, and there was enough to rouse in his spirit a Divine indignation, and he groaned and shuddered. He roused himself to a conflict which would be a prelibation of the cross and the burial. He took the diseases of men upon himself when he took them away. He took the death-agony of Lazarus and the humiliation of the grave and the tears of the sisters upon himself when he resolved to cry, "Lazarus, come forth!" and to snatch from the grasp of the grim conqueror for a little while one of his victims. Compare the toil of Hercules in wrestling with death for the wife of Admetus.
