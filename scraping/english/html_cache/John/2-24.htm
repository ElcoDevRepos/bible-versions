Despite the miracles He performed, which led many to believe in His name, Jesus chose not to entrust Himself to the crowds. This decision reflects His divine wisdom and understanding of human nature. The Greek word for "entrust" is the same as "believe," indicating a deeper level of trust or commitment. Jesus' actions here demonstrate His awareness of the superficial nature of the crowd's belief, which was based on signs rather than a true understanding of His mission and identity. This moment foreshadows the later rejection and misunderstanding He would face, even from those who initially followed Him.<p><b>for He knew them all</b><br>Jesus' knowledge of all people is a testament to His divine omniscience. This phrase highlights His ability to see beyond outward appearances and discern the true intentions and thoughts of individuals. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates this ability, such as when He perceives the thoughts of the Pharisees or knows the history of the Samaritan woman at the well. This insight is not just a human intuition but a divine attribute, affirming His identity as the Son of God. The phrase also connects to the Old Testament understanding of God's knowledge of humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139</a>, which speaks of God's intimate knowledge of each person. Jesus' discernment here serves as a reminder of the need for genuine faith and commitment, rather than a reliance on signs and wonders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is performing His ministry on earth.

Compare <a href="/john/6-2.htm">John 6:2 and 6</a>:26, where multitudes follow Him for signs or bread rather than for truth.<p>&#8226; Scripture often marks such contrasts to spotlight God&#8217;s viewpoint versus human enthusiasm (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did not entrust Himself</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Entrust&#8221; echoes the root idea of believing or placing confidence. The crowd &#8220;believed&#8221; in Him (v. 23), yet He would not &#8220;believe in&#8221; them.<p>&#8226; His restraint underscores discernment: outward profession is not equal to inward regeneration (<a href="/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31-47</a>; <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus guarded the timing and manner of His self-disclosure; He would not hand over His mission to unstable supporters (<a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6</a>; <a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44-45</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: faith must be sincere; God is not obligated to affirm mere excitement (<a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; refers to festival-goers in Jerusalem&#8211;&#8211;pilgrims swept up by spectacular signs (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13, 23</a>).<p>&#8226; Sign-based faith is fragile.

Though crowds believed after seeing signs, He withheld deeper self-revelation, discerning that their faith was temporary and self-centered. His omniscience exposes superficial belief and invites us to genuine trust that abides in His word and yields obedient lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) But beneath this shallow surface there is the unbroken ledge of rock. They are easily moved just because they are not deeply moved. The eye which looked at, looked into, others (comp. <a href="/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!">John 1:47</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> saw to the very depth of their hearts too, and knew all. It saw in that depth that the true inner man did not believe, did not commit itself to Him; it found not the spiritual receptivity, and there could not therefore be the spiritual revelation. He, on His part, did not commit Himself unto them. (Comp. <a href="/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>, Note.) Our version gives the correct sense, but it should be noted that "believed" in <a href="/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>, and "commit" here, represent the same Greek word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus did not</span> (imperfect) <span class="cmt_word">trust himself to them;</span> not even to those who had "trusted on his Name." This remarkable expression corresponds with many actions and methods of Jesus. When he was offered the homage of devils, he forbade them to speak. When those who had been simply healed of bodily disease began garrulously to proclaim his praises, he silenced them. He had no faith in their faith, and consequently did not open to them more of his nature; still less did he assume, as they would have liked him to do, an immediate and outward Messiahship of political revolt. He did not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax, and often made use of the smallest remnant of spiritual apprehension; but even in Galilee, when they would by force have made him a king, "he sent the multitudes away." The apparently arbitrary permission given to others to proclaim his Name (as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to the healed demoniac of Gergesa, <a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>; cf. Luke 9:57-62) suggests the precise inquiry which John had felt from the first Jerusalem visit, and which, with profound insight, he thus meets: "He did not trust himself to them," <span class="cmt_word">owing to the fact that he knew</span> - (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by apperceptive and continuous processes) - <span class="cmt_word">all</span> (<span class="accented">men</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>persons</span>. He penetrated their thoughts, discerned their character, saw the meaning of their faith, the burden of their wishes, the regal passions that consumed them - he knew all. <span class="cmt_word">And also because he had no need that any should testify what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man; for he himself</span> - without such aid - <span class="cmt_word">knew what was in</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">man</span>. The definite articles here may either restrict the meaning to the men who happened one by one to come under his searching glance (<a href="/john/7-51.htm">John 7:51</a>; Meyer), or it may mean "man" generically, "human nature" in all its peril, weakness, and self-deception. Geikie ('Life of Christ,' 1, 508) gives a novel, though entirely indefensible, translation: "He needed not that any should bear witness respecting him as man." The better and more accurate translation is the first; but since his glance is universal and contact with souls continuous - man by man - the statement thus embraces even <span class="accented">more than is</span> involved in the generic sense. The knowledge of man (<span class="accented">homo</span>) "generically" would not embrace his individualities - would leave out the specialities of each case. The particularism of Christ's penetrative glance gives the stronger and better explanation of the reserve of Christ in dealing with these half-believers, than the generic or rather universal knowledge which is supposed to be involved.
