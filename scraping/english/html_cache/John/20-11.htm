Her standing outside signifies her initial reluctance or inability to enter due to grief. In Jewish culture, mourning was a deeply emotional and communal experience, often involving loud lamentation. Mary's weeping reflects the profound loss felt by Jesus' followers after His crucifixion. Her actions fulfill the role of women as primary witnesses to Jesus' resurrection, a significant detail given the cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued.<p><b>And as she wept,</b><br>The repetition of her weeping emphasizes the depth of her sorrow. This moment captures the human experience of loss and despair, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. The Psalms often express similar emotions, such as in <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, which contrasts weeping with eventual joy. Mary's tears also echo the lamentations of the prophets, who mourned over Israel's spiritual state, pointing to the broader narrative of redemption and hope.<p><b>she bent down to look into the tomb,</b><br>Mary's action of bending down indicates a shift from passive mourning to active seeking. This movement symbolizes a transition from despair to the search for understanding and truth. The tomb, a place of death, becomes a focal point for the revelation of life through Jesus' resurrection. Her act of looking into the tomb parallels the invitation to seek and find, as encouraged in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>. This moment foreshadows the revelation of the empty tomb, a pivotal event in Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over death and fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is the central figure in this verse.

Some have said two white-robed Essenes like those who are also supposed to have appeared to our Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration, his secret friends, who had really spirited the body of Jesus away, lingered yet in the tomb, and duped Mary by a lying story. Scorning this hypothesis, legendarists have said - Here we see the subjective creation of the terrified and weeping women, who took white clothes for men or angels, and whose fancies were readily believed; while mythical hypotheses have suggested that a glamour of love, many years after the event, created a pathetic and beautiful fiction of what may have happened on that memorable dawn. Every one of these interpretations vanishes before the authenticity of John's Gospel. The disciple whom Jesus loved, the author of the Apocalypse, was personally acquainted with Mary of Magdala, and had much communion with her, and could heartily believe her story. If there be no spiritual world, no kind nor modes of existence beyond what we call the seen and temporal, and no thought higher than man's thought; if every testimony to this spiritual world right through the ages is a delusion, and can be explained away; if it be an irrational or impossible supposition; - why, then this vision must pass away with the rest. But the entire teaching of the Bible from end to end reveals and bears witness to a world ordinarily unseen by human eyes, but none the less real. To some the door thus opened into heaven is closed and sealed by the seven seals of materialism, agnosticism, dogmatism, scientism, worldliness, indifference, and unspirituality. How much do men forget that all human life is but a very temporary, ever-vanishing robe around a permanent and abiding spirit! that it is entirely conceivable that even pure spirit can come for our advantage into still more evanescent forms than those we now possess, which yet make appeal to what we call our senses of sight and hearing! Objective as such manifestations are, they are no more visible to all eyes or ears than the mysteries of art are open to all human sensibility. The harmonies of heaven are not heard by those who are muffled up with vesture of decay, and there is nothing lying beyond or behind the veil of sense to the unspiritual. The whole critical school might have rambled about the garden, with hammer and spectacles, and would never have seen an angel or the risen Christ; but, thank God, all eyes were not so dim. Some were there who saw and believed; and they have revolutionized the world's thought. Their vision is the key of time; their voice, the word that wakes the dead. This manifestation of the unseen world does not contradict the statement of Matthew that an angel of the Lord had been seen sitting on the displaced stone, and terrified the Roman guard; nor Mark's assurance that the women had seen a young man clothed in a white robe, who gave the Divine assurance which perplexed the eleven; nor Luke's description of two men clothed in glittering apparel, who told them that the Lord was living. Surely it is impossible to represent Mary of Magdala's present vision as identical with that which had occurred at an earlier hour; but it is clear that, if she shared in the earlier vision at all, she had not been convinced by it, for still she wept in utter despair. The fact that these angelic appearances should take different forms to different witnesses belongs to their very nature. Such visions, translated into words, would naturally differ. If there had been rigid uniformity in the statements of the three evangelists, and of the fourth with them, grave suspicion would have been attached to the entire recital. The experiences of several different women would be repeated a thousand times. They would be questioned separately and together in every possible way; and it appears from all four narratives that three forms of the ultimate traditions alike declare that hope and fear arising from the empty grave were quickened and stimulated by angelic ambassadors, who variously prepared their mind to receive the grand objective fact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Mary</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Maria)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3137.htm">Strong's 3137: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Mariam of Hebrew origin; Maria or Mariam, the name of six Christian females.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stood</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7985;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#954;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(heist&#275;kei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pluperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2476.htm">Strong's 2476: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary stao stah'-o; to stand, used in various applications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">outside</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#958;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1854.htm">Strong's 1854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Without, outside.
