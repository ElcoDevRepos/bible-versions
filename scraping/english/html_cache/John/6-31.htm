The manna (see <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>; <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>.) appeared like the hoar frost out of heaven. It was gifted with numerous qualities - perishable if not immediately used, respecting in mysterious way the sabbath sanctity, attending the Israelites through their forty years" wandering, terminating when no longer wanted, utterly unlike, in quantity and quality, to what is the Oriental manna of commerce (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Manna"). The psalmists spoke of it (<a href="/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-40.htm">Psalm 105:40</a>) as virtually coming down out of heaven, as "corn of heaven," as "angels' food." The Targum of Jonathan, <a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>, says, "God caused bread to descend from heaven upon the sons of Israel," and a rabbinical commentary on Ecclesiastes, quoted by Lightfoot and Wettestein: "Redemptor prior descendere fecit pro iis manna; sic et Redemptor posterior descendere faciet manna." Consequently, they make the challenge, not as though Jesus had done no sign, but as though he had not done enough to put himself on an equality with Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Our</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;m&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
