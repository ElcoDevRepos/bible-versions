This division is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the varied responses to Jesus' ministry. The Jewish community was diverse, with groups like the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes holding different beliefs and expectations about the Messiah. Jesus' teachings often challenged the established religious norms, leading to disagreements and debates. This division can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, where the Messiah is described as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to both houses of Israel.<p><b>because of Jesus&#8217; message</b><br>Jesus' message was revolutionary and often counter-cultural, emphasizing themes like the Kingdom of God, repentance, and the fulfillment of the Law through love and grace. His claims of divinity and authority, as seen in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a> where He states, "I and the Father are one," were particularly controversial. This message challenged the religious leaders' understanding of God and the Law, leading to division. The message of Jesus also fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe a suffering servant who would bring salvation. Jesus' teachings and actions, such as performing miracles and forgiving sins, were seen as direct claims to His messianic identity, further polarizing His audience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose teachings and identity as the Good Shepherd cause division among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people present during Jesus' ministry, often representing the religious leaders and the general populace who were divided in their opinions about Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/division.htm">Division</a></b><br>The event of disagreement and conflict among the Jews regarding Jesus' teachings and claims about Himself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divisive_nature_of_truth.htm">The Divisive Nature of Truth</a></b><br>Jesus' message inherently divides because it challenges existing beliefs and calls for a decision.
