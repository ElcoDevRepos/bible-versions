The crowd's inquiry shows their interest in understanding Jesus' teachings and their desire to engage with Him. This moment occurs in Capernaum, a significant location in Jesus' ministry, where He performed many miracles and taught in the synagogue. The crowd's question reflects a common theme in the Gospels, where people seek to understand the requirements of following God.<p><b>&#8220;What must we do</b><br>The question reveals a works-based mindset prevalent in Jewish culture at the time, rooted in the Mosaic Law and the Pharisaic traditions that emphasized adherence to the law as a means of righteousness. This mindset is challenged by Jesus throughout His ministry, as He emphasizes faith and belief over mere works. The question also echoes the rich young ruler's inquiry in <a href="/matthew/19-16.htm">Matthew 19:16</a>, where he asks Jesus what good deed he must do to have eternal life.<p><b>to perform the works of God?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "works of God" suggests actions that are pleasing to God or that fulfill His will. In the Jewish context, this would have been understood as following the commandments and engaging in religious practices. However, Jesus redefines the "works of God" in the following verses, emphasizing belief in Him as the primary work God desires. This shift from works to faith is a central theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul, such as <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which underscores salvation by grace through faith, not by works. This question sets the stage for Jesus to reveal deeper spiritual truths about faith and the nature of true discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people who followed Jesus after witnessing the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000.

The verse prepares the way for <a href="/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>, where the Lord makes clear that the only &#8220;work&#8221; that pleases God is trusting His Son.

They understand them in that sense. There are works for them to do which are appointed of God. What shall they do that they may work these works?

What steps must they take that they too may work them?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They say unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?</span> The works of God might be, either works like those which are wrought by God the Father, but this would be a very improbable demand; or "the works of God" may be those which God has assigned to man as the conditions of his favour. There is a breadth about the question that may cover the ground involved in Christ's declaration, but it reveals, at the same time, the self-complacency, the carnal conception on the part of these Galilaeans of their being able, competent, to fulfil along certain lines to be specified, all the required conditions. But we must not be too hard on these Galilaeans, brought up as they were to believe in the efficacy of certain rounds of specific and arbitrary duties, methods of purification, forms of service and of abstinence, pilgrimages and fastings and feastings, as well as obedience to a specific moral code. They ask quite rationally, "What must we do?" and in various forms the same question bursts from the heart of all who have, starting from utter indifference, made any progress towards, or in the direction of, holy living or of Divine pleasing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
