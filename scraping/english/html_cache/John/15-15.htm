Jesus elevates His disciples from mere servants to a more intimate relationship. This shift signifies a deeper level of trust and intimacy. In the Old Testament, figures like Moses and David were called servants of God, highlighting their roles in God's plan, but Jesus offers something greater.<p><b>for a servant does not understand what his master is doing</b><br>This phrase highlights the limited knowledge and understanding a servant has regarding the master's plans. In biblical times, servants were expected to follow orders without question. Jesus contrasts this with the relationship He offers, where His followers are given insight into God's purposes. This echoes the idea in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where God reveals His plans to His prophets.<p><b>But I have called you friends</b><br>Calling the disciples "friends" indicates a significant shift in relationship. Friendship implies mutual knowledge, trust, and love. In ancient cultures, friendship was a bond of loyalty and shared purpose. This reflects the covenant relationship God desires with His people, as seen in the friendship between God and Abraham (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>).<p><b>because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you</b><br>Jesus emphasizes the transparency and openness He has with His disciples. This phrase underscores the divine revelation Jesus provides, sharing the wisdom and knowledge He received from the Father. It aligns with the role of Jesus as the ultimate prophet, revealing God's will, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>. This also fulfills the promise of the New Covenant, where God's law is written on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing the intimate relationship He shares with them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' message, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father (God)</a></b><br>Referred to by Jesus as the source of all knowledge and wisdom that He imparts to His disciples.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to those who serve without understanding the full scope of their master's plans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/friends.htm">Friends</a></b><br>The new status Jesus gives to His disciples, indicating a deeper, more personal relationship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_christ.htm">Intimacy with Christ</a></b><br>Jesus invites us into a personal relationship where we are not just followers but friends who share in His mission and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_of_god's_will.htm">Revelation of God's Will</a></b><br>As friends of Jesus, we are privy to the knowledge and understanding of God's plans, which He reveals to us through His Word and Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_of_identity.htm">Transformation of Identity</a></b><br>Our identity in Christ transforms from mere servants to beloved friends, which should impact how we live and serve.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_friendship.htm">Obedience and Friendship</a></b><br>True friendship with Jesus involves obedience to His commands, as it reflects our love and commitment to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/communion_with_god.htm">Communion with God</a></b><br>Like Moses and Abraham, we are called to a relationship where we can communicate openly with God, seeking His guidance and wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_15_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 15:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_15_15_Servants_to_friends.htm">How does John 15:15 redefine our relationship with Jesus from servants to friends?

And moreover, later on in this very chapter (Ver. 20), the word and thought return, so that this relation to him, gloried in by St. Paul (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>), St. James (<a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>), Jude (<a href="/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>), and even St. John (<a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>), could be sustained in its integrity, even after it had been transfigured, and penetrated through and through with the light of love. <span class="cmt_word">Because the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.</span> The slave is an instrument, doing by commandment, not from intimate knowledge, his Lord's behests. <span class="cmt_word">But you I have called</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) - on previous occasions (see <a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>; and cf. <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>, "Our friend Lazarus") - <span class="cmt_word">friends</span>, for whom it is joy to die, and I have effected the transfiguration of your service into love.

The reason of the present assertion is the proof that it thus supplies of their dearness to him. "Ye are my friends." He had told them all that they could <span class="accented">bear</span>. He had lifted the veil high enough for their truest joy and noblest discipline. He had bared his heart to them. He had kept back nothing that was profitable.
