These chapters contain Jesus' final teachings and prayers for His disciples before His arrest. The words spoken include promises of the Holy Spirit, encouragement to remain in His love, and a prayer for unity among believers. This moment marks the transition from Jesus' public ministry to His passion.<p><b>He went out with His disciples</b><br>Jesus' movement with His disciples signifies His leadership and the close relationship He maintained with them. This act of going out together highlights the communal aspect of His ministry and the importance of fellowship among believers. It also sets the stage for the events of His arrest, where His disciples' loyalty and understanding of His mission will be tested.<p><b>across the Kidron Valley</b><br>The Kidron Valley is a significant geographical location east of Jerusalem, separating the city from the Mount of Olives. Historically, it was a place associated with mourning and judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>). Crossing the Kidron Valley symbolizes Jesus' journey towards His impending suffering and sacrifice. The valley's mention connects to King David's flight from Absalom, drawing a parallel between David's betrayal and Jesus' forthcoming betrayal by Judas.<p><b>where they entered a garden</b><br>The garden, identified in other Gospels as Gethsemane, is located on the Mount of Olives. Gardens in biblical times were places of solitude and prayer, fitting for Jesus' purpose of seeking strength from the Father. The garden setting recalls the Garden of Eden, where the first Adam fell into sin, contrasting with Jesus, the second Adam, who would remain obedient unto death. This location becomes the backdrop for Jesus' intense prayer and submission to God's will, fulfilling His role as the suffering servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to face His arrest and crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who accompany Him, demonstrating their loyalty and commitment, though they will soon face trials of their own.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kidron_valley.htm">Kidron Valley</a></b><br>A valley located on the eastern side of Jerusalem, significant in Jewish history and prophecy, often associated with judgment and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden.htm">Garden</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of prayer and preparation for Jesus before His arrest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer_in_trials.htm">The Importance of Prayer in Trials</a></b><br>Jesus' retreat to the garden emphasizes the necessity of prayer and communion with God, especially in times of impending trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' journey across the Kidron Valley and into the garden fulfills Old Testament prophecies, underscoring the divine plan and sovereignty of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_disciples.htm">The Role of the Disciples</a></b><br>The presence of the disciples highlights the importance of community and support in spiritual journeys, even when facing personal failures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_spiritual_battles.htm">Preparation for Spiritual Battles</a></b><br>Just as Jesus prepared Himself for His arrest and crucifixion, believers are called to prepare spiritually for the challenges they face.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbolism_of_the_garden.htm">The Symbolism of the Garden</a></b><br>The garden represents a place of both struggle and surrender, teaching believers about the balance of wrestling with God's will and ultimately submitting to it.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_18_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 18:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_18_1_Jesus_resolve_for_God_s_plan.htm">How does John 18:1 demonstrate Jesus' willingness to fulfill God's plan?

The stream rises north of Jerusalem, and separates the city on its eastern side from Scopas and the Mount of Olives. It reaches its deepest depression at the point where it joins the Valley of Hinnom near the well of Rogel, contributing to the peculiar physical conformation of the city. The stream is in summer dry to its bed, and Robinson, Grove, and Warren conjecture, in agreement with an old tradition, that there is, below the present surface of its bed, a subterraneous watercourse, whose waters may be heard flowing. The stream takes a sudden bend to the southeast at En-Rogel, and makes its way, by the convent of Saba, to the Dead Sea. It is not without interest that this note of place given by St. John alone - for the three other evangelists simply speak of "the Mount of <span class="accented">Olives"</span> <span class="accented">- brings</span> the narrative into relation with the story of David's flight from Absalom by the same route, and also the Jewish expectation (<a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>), and Mohammedan prediction, that here will take place the final judgment (Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. "<span class="accented">Kedron</span>," by Grove; 'Pictorial Palestine,' vol. 1; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:269: Winer's 'B. Realworterbuch,' art. "Kedron;" Dean Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine;' 'The Recovery of Jerusalem,' by Capt. Warren and Capt. Wilson, <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1</a>. and 5.). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a garden</span>. This reference is in agreement (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>; <a href="/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a>) with the synoptic description of the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "parcel of <span class="accented">ground</span>," small farm, or olive yard, enclosed from the rest of the hillside, and called "Gethsemane" (<span class="accented">gath-shammi</span>, press for oil). The traditional site of the garden dates back to the time of Constantine, and may be the true scene of the agony described by the synoptists. There are still remaining "the eight aged olive trees," which carry back the associations to the hour of the great travail. It is certain that the general features of the scene still closely correspond with what was visible on the awful night ('Pictorial Palestine,' 1:86, 98). Patristic and mediaeval writers, with Hengstenberg and Wordsworth, see parallels between the garden of Eden lost by man's sin, and the garden of Gethsemane where the second Adam met the prince of this world, and bore the weight of human transgression and shame, and regained for man the paradise which Adam lost. It is still more interesting to notice a further touch recorded by John: <span class="cmt_word">Into which</span> - into the quiet retreat and partial concealment of which - <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (Jesus) <span class="cmt_word">entered himself, and his disciples</span>. We know from the other Gospels that they were separated -eight remained on watch near the entrance, and Peter and James and John went further into the recesses of the garden, and again, "about a stone's cast," in the depth of the olive-shade, our blessed Lord retired to "pray." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When] Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had spoken</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
