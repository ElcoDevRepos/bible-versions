The context is the Last Supper, where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending crucifixion. The glorification of God in Jesus refers to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus' obedience, suffering, and ultimate sacrifice. This reflects the unity and purpose within the Trinity, as seen in <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1</a>, where Jesus prays for the Father to glorify the Son so that the Son may glorify the Father. The concept of glorification here is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where God's glory is often associated with His presence and mighty acts (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>).<p><b>God will also glorify the Son in Himself</b><br>This phrase indicates that God the Father will glorify Jesus through His resurrection and exaltation. The resurrection is a pivotal event that confirms Jesus' divine nature and mission, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>. The glorification of the Son is not only a future event but also an immediate reality, as Jesus' death and resurrection are imminent. This glorification is a testament to Jesus' divine authority and His role as the mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where God exalts Jesus and gives Him the name above every name.<p><b>and will glorify Him at once</b><br>The immediacy of this glorification underscores the urgency and certainty of God's plan. Jesus' crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are not distant events but are about to unfold rapidly. This phrase highlights the divine timing and sovereignty in the unfolding of salvation history. The "at once" aspect can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His death and resurrection, as He repeatedly told His disciples that He would rise on the third day (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>). This immediate glorification also points to the transformative impact of Jesus' work, which brings about the new covenant and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples during the Last Supper.

As believers, we are called to reflect this relationship by seeking to glorify God in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_glorification.htm">Immediate Glorification</a></b><br>The phrase "at once" indicates the immediacy of God's response to Jesus' obedience.

With that backdrop He says, &#8220;If God is glorified in Him.&#8221; The statement is not doubtful; it is the certainty that the Father&#8217;s honor will shine through the Son&#8217;s obedience.<p>&#8226; The cross will display God&#8217;s attributes&#8212;holiness that judges sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>), love that sacrifices for sinners (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>), wisdom that unites justice and mercy (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).
