Moses is credited with writing the first five books of the Bible, known as the Torah or Pentateuch. In the context of <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, Jesus is addressing Jewish leaders who prided themselves on their adherence to the Mosaic Law. The implication is that true belief in Moses would naturally lead to belief in Jesus, as Moses' writings contain prophecies and types that point to the coming Messiah. For example, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> speaks of a prophet like Moses whom God would raise up, which is understood as a reference to Christ.<p><b>you would believe Me</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts His authority and identity as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. The Jewish leaders' failure to recognize Jesus as the Messiah is attributed to their lack of genuine belief in the Scriptures they claim to uphold. This statement underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, with Jesus as the central figure who fulfills the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament. The connection between belief in Moses and belief in Jesus is a call to recognize the unity of God's revelation.<p><b>because he wrote about Me</b><br>This phrase indicates that Moses' writings contain direct and indirect references to Jesus. Examples include the promise of a coming prophet (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>), the typology of the Passover lamb (Exodus 12), and the bronze serpent lifted up in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>), which Jesus Himself references in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>. These elements serve as types and shadows that find their ultimate fulfillment in Christ. The assertion that Moses wrote about Jesus challenges the audience to re-examine their understanding of the Scriptures and recognize Jesus as the anticipated Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, asserting His divine authority and connection to the Old Testament.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A revered prophet and lawgiver in Jewish tradition, whose writings are foundational to the Jewish faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience Jesus addresses, who are knowledgeable about the Law of Moses but skeptical of Jesus' claims.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_writings_of_moses.htm">The Writings of Moses</a></b><br>Refers to the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch), which include prophecies and typologies pointing to the Messiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_jesus'_discourse.htm">The Event of Jesus' Discourse</a></b><br>This conversation occurs during a confrontation with Jewish leaders who question Jesus' authority and identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Understanding the Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, including those by Moses.

To believe Moses rightly is to recognize and trust Jesus, the promised Redeemer at the center of Scripture&#8217;s grand narrative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">For had ye believed Moses.</span>--The present incredulity springs from that of the past. If they had really believed Moses, they would have seen in the whole spirit of the Pentateuch a manifestation of God, which would have led them to the fuller manifestation in Christ. Worship, and sacrifice, and offering, and priesthood, were all meant to teach. Their very name for "law" (<span class= "ital">Thorah</span>) meant "instruction." But they accepted what the senses could know, and never went down beneath this surface to its true significance--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they never <span class= "ital">believed</span> Moses. We have here, in another form, the thought of <a href="/context/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39-40</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For he wrote of me.</span>--See the marginal references; but the thought is not to be confined to these passages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46, 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me.</span> The reason for the previous saying is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>. The form of the conditional sentence shows that the protasis is a supposition of an event contrary to the fact. They were <span class="accented">not believing</span> Moses, though they were putting a vain and illusive confidence in him; and hence they were not believing in Christ. Here is the secret of the antagonism to the Lord. A deeper understanding of their own Scripture would involve an acceptance of the claims of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">For he wrote of me</span>. The old saying contains Christ's utterance: <span class="accented">Novum Testamentum in Vetere latet, Vetus Testamentum in Novo patet.</span> Reference is made to the great place which Moses gave to the first promise, to the typical deliverances of a fallen world, to the hopes of a redeeming Seed. Christ referred to the Mosaic type involved in the spirit willing to sacrifice the Only Begotten, to the creation of the birthright blessing, the visions of the dying Israel, to the blessings on Judah; to the significance of the Law, of the tabernacle, of the Passover, of the Day of Atonement, of prophet, priest, and king, and the very special prophecy concerning a Prophet like unto himself. More than this, Moses had set forth in the Decalogue the portrait sketch of the perfect Man, of the Divine life which the Lord Jesus proceeded to fill out, to fulfil. He awakened by the Law that sense of sin and sinfulness which the Lord Christ had come to soothe and obliterate. but if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? "They are easier for you to understand; you have them ever on your tongue. If their meaning is missed, the deeper truths of my words will be more inaccessible to you." The antithesis is rather between the "his" and "my" than between the "writings" and "words." "This charge of not believing Moses, addressed to people who were put in a fury by the pretended violation of one of the Mosaic commandments, recalls other words of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29-32</a>), '<span class="accented">Ye build the tombs of the prophets, wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are children of them that killed the prophets</span>" (Godet). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
