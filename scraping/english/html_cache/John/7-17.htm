The desire to do God's will is a prerequisite for understanding spiritual teachings. This aligns with the biblical principle that God reveals Himself to those who earnestly seek Him (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>). The concept of "His will" refers to God's divine plan and commandments, which are often revealed through Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, the Jewish people were familiar with the idea of seeking God's will through the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>he will know whether My teaching is from God</b><br>Here, Jesus asserts that genuine seekers of God's will can discern the divine origin of His teachings. This statement implies that spiritual insight is granted to those who are obedient and open to God's guidance. The claim that His teaching is from God is a direct assertion of His divine authority and messianic identity. This echoes the Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah who would teach God's truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>). The historical context includes the skepticism Jesus faced from religious leaders who questioned His authority and origins.<p><b>or whether I speak on My own</b><br>This phrase addresses the possibility of Jesus speaking independently of divine authority. By contrasting His teachings with those who might speak on their own, Jesus highlights His unique relationship with the Father. In the cultural and historical context, many teachers and prophets claimed divine inspiration, but Jesus distinguishes Himself by asserting that His words are not self-derived but are directly from God. This distinction is crucial in understanding the nature of Jesus' ministry and His fulfillment of the role of the true prophet and teacher as foretold in Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts during the Feast of Tabernacles, addressing the crowd and religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>They are questioning Jesus' authority and the source of His teachings, skeptical of His claims and seeking to challenge Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A diverse group of people present at the Feast, including those who are curious, skeptical, and some who are beginning to believe in Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness journey, during which Jesus delivers this teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_courts.htm">The Temple Courts</a></b><br>The setting for this discourse, a place of teaching and worship in Jerusalem where Jesus often engaged with the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_to_do_god's_will.htm">Desire to Do God's Will</a></b><br>True understanding of Jesus' teachings begins with a genuine desire to align with God's will.

It is not deed, which is the outcome of faith; but will, which precedes it, that is here spoken of. This human will to do the divine will is the condition of knowing it. The words are unlimited and far-reaching in their meaning. Those who heard them would naturally understand them, as it was intended they should, of the divine will expressed in the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/john/7-19.htm" title="Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?">John 7:19</a>), but they include the will of God revealed, more or less clearly, to all men and in all times. Our thoughts dwell naturally on representative lives, such as those of Saul the Pharisee, Cornelius the centurion, Justin the philosopher; but the truth holds good for every honest heart in every walk of life. The "any man" of Christ's own words excludes none from its reach, and the voice of comfort and of hope is spoken alike to all in our ignorance, fears, doubts--that he who in very deed willeth to do God's will, shall not fail to know, now or in the life to come, of the teaching whether it be of God.

If the Divine will concerning conduct meets the spontaneous act of the human will, if a man's will is set to fulfil the Divine will, to will and do what is revealed to him by God, the eye of the soul will be opened to see other things as well, and especially will have power to discern the all-pervading Divine element in this teaching of mine. <span class="cmt_word">He shall know concerning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the teaching, whether it be of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">God, or whether I speak from myself</span> - from the simple ground of my own independent, self-taught humanity. The first and natural application of this mighty dictum and condition was a test by which the Jews might come at once to the understanding of his more than prophetic claim to teach - he having never learned in their rabbinical schools. It amounted to this: Your moral harmony with the will of God as already revealed to you will be the sure index and confirmation of the great fact I have just referred to. You will discern the Divine in my words, the absolutely true in my teaching. Here the Lord again refers to the great principle, "He that hath heard of the Father, and learned, cometh unto me;" "He that is of the truth heareth my voice." This moral submission to God will quicken all your powers to discern and come to an invincible assent as to my claims. This is not the deep subjective testimony of the inner intuition of those that already believe, by which a verbal assent becomes a fall consent, an unchangeable conviction, or "the full assurance of faith;" but it is addressed to <span class="accented">unbelievers</span>, and assures those who are bewildered by the novelty and sweep of his own words that, if they are set on doing the will of God, they will become perfectly satisfied that his own teaching, such as it is, is a stream of heavenly truth bursting from the very heart of God. The text has been cited by certain writers as the sum totel of the Christian revelation, almost as though it substituted practical obedience for true thinking, as though people might well be content with holy living, and might safely leave the decision of all difficult problems of thought and revelation to shift for themselves. Nothing could be further from its real meaning, either at the time or in any of its subsequent or universal applications. The solemn utterance has a wide outlook, and is constantly establishing its own verity. A profound and voluntary desire to do the will of God is the best preparation for intuitively perceiving the Divine authority of Christ and of his religion. The desire for holiness of principle and life sees in Christ not only the loftiest ideal of perfection, but the surest satisfaction to its conscious weakness, and casts itself upon his promises of saving power. The faith which is satisfied with Christ is not merely a conclusion drawn by logical processes from satisfactory premisses, it is the consequence of a new nature or a moral regeneration. In other words, it is the more practical and expanded form of the truth first of all addressed to Nicodemus, and also lying at the heart of the Beatitudes: "Except a man be born anew [from above], he cannot see the kingdom of God." If he is born again he <span class="accented">will</span> see it. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." "No man can come unto me except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him." The sentence presents the truth in a hopeful and positive form, and puts the criterion of the Divine informant within the reach of practical ethics. It is an appeal to the conscience as well as to the understanding. Apart from the subjective moral element, all other evidences of the presence of the Divine in nature, in history, in Christ, will be unimpressive and unimportant. A willingness to do the will of God is not a substitute for, but a condition of, true knowledge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
