In the context of <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>, Jesus is preparing His disciples for the challenges they will encounter after His departure. Historically, early Christians faced significant persecution from both Jewish authorities and the Roman Empire. This treatment is a continuation of the world's rejection of Jesus Himself, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>because of My name</b><br>The name of Jesus represents His authority, mission, and identity as the Messiah. In biblical times, a name was more than just a label; it conveyed the essence and character of a person. The persecution arises because believers identify with Jesus and His teachings, which often stand in opposition to worldly values. This echoes Jesus' earlier teachings in the Beatitudes, where He blesses those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake.<p><b>since they do not know the One who sent Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual ignorance of those who reject Jesus and His followers. "The One who sent Me" refers to God the Father. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus emphasizes His divine mission and unity with the Father. The rejection of Jesus is ultimately a rejection of God Himself. This connects to the broader biblical theme of knowing God, which involves a relationship characterized by love, obedience, and faith. The ignorance of God is a recurring theme in the prophets, where Israel's failure to know God leads to judgment and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, preparing them for the persecution they will face because of their association with Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' message, representing all believers who follow Christ and bear His name.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_sent_me.htm">The One who sent Me</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, emphasizing the divine mission and authority of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The event or experience Jesus is warning His followers about, which is a result of their identification with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents those who are opposed to Jesus and His teachings, often characterized by ignorance of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_persecution.htm">Understanding Persecution</a></b><br>Recognize that persecution is a natural consequence of following Christ and bearing His name.

The mistreatment He faced is the pattern believers should expect.<p>&#8226; He says &#8220;treat you like this,&#8221; pointing back to the hostility of verses 18&#8211;20. Persecution, slander, exclusion&#8212;these are part of following the Master (<a href="/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly prepares us: &#8220;Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>). When opposition comes, it confirms&#8212;not contradicts&#8212;our identity with Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of My name</b><p>&#8226; The issue is not personality or politics; it is allegiance to Jesus. &#8220;You will be hated by everyone because of My name&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;My name&#8221; stands for His authority, character, and exclusive claim: &#8220;Salvation exists in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Early believers were told &#8220;stop speaking in this name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17</a>). Nothing has changed. When we speak and live openly for Christ, we should expect pushback.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since they do not know the One who sent Me</b><p>&#8226; Rejection of the Son exposes ignorance of the Father. Jesus earlier declared, &#8220;If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-19.htm">John 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual blindness lies at the root of hostility. Unbelief about God&#8217;s character, holiness, and plan produces resistance to the gospel (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus emphasizes that persecution is ultimately against God Himself. Saul learned this when the risen Lord asked, &#8220;Why do you persecute Me?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). To oppose Christ&#8217;s people is to oppose the One who sent Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/15-21.htm">John 15:21</a> teaches that followers of Jesus can expect opposition. The world&#8217;s mistreatment mirrors what Christ experienced, it centers on our public identification with His name, and it flows from people&#8217;s ignorance of the Father who sent Him. Standing firm in that name, we share both His sufferings and His promise of eternal life with the God we now know.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">But all these things will they do unto you.</span>--These words are themselves an interpretation of the previous verse. They suppose the persecution and hatred to take place, and find the true consolation in the fact that this would be done to them as representing their Lord. The Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles are a commentary on this text. (Comp., among numerous passages, <a href="/acts/4-17.htm" title="But that it spread no further among the people, let us straightly threaten them, that they speak from now on to no man in this name.">Acts 4:17</a>; <a href="/acts/9-14.htm" title="And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.">Acts 9:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Because they know not him that sent me.</span>--The hatred is here traced to its true cause, which is ignorance of God. The Apostles were those sent by Christ. He Himself was the Apostle of the Father. They would hate His messenger, and hate Him, the messenger of God, because they knew not God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But all these things will they do unto you</span>. By way of consolation, he added, in view of the antagonism which the world would deliberately pursue towards them, <span class="cmt_word">For my Name's sake</span>. Many suppose that the consolatory element is emphasized in this clause. However, the idea contained in the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> has been already expressed in the previous verses, and the whole of the verse so far merely gathers it up for a new and suggestive explanation. For the Name of Christ these disciples will not only pray, labor, suffer, and die, but in the power of it they will transmute their sorrows into raptures, their tribulations into glory. <span class="cmt_word">Because they know not him that sent me.</span> If they had known the heart and nature of the Sender, they would have understood the mission of the Savior, and would neither have hated him nor his representations. (Here Lucke, Hengstenberg, Luthardt, and Lange are preferable to Meyer and Godet.) It is utter grief to Jesus that the world has been ignorant of the Father. This ignorance explains its antagonism to the representatives of Christ, and is the most appalling witness to its own depravation. No fact is more patent in the entire history of human thoughts about God than this, that "the world by wisdom knows him not," nay, it travesties his Name, misrepresents his character, distrusts, fears, and flees from the face of God. It was left to Christ to reveal the Father. In many different mental tendencies even Christendom has obscured or denied the Fatherhood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/15-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
