This town is Sychar, located in Samaria, a region often avoided by Jews due to longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. The disciples' willingness to enter a Samaritan town indicates a breaking of traditional barriers, foreshadowing the broader mission to the Gentiles. This act also sets the stage for Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman, highlighting the theme of crossing cultural boundaries.<p><b>to buy food.</b><br>Purchasing food in a Samaritan town would have been unusual for Jews, who often avoided contact with Samaritans due to concerns about ritual purity. This action underscores the practical needs of Jesus and His disciples, emphasizing His humanity. It also illustrates the breaking down of social and religious barriers, as Jesus' ministry often challenged prevailing norms. The act of buying food connects to other scriptural instances where Jesus provides or shares meals, symbolizing fellowship and the breaking of bread as a precursor to the Last Supper and the Eucharist.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of John, the Son of God, who is at the well speaking with the Samaritan woman.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who have gone into the town to buy food, leaving Jesus alone at the well.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>- A woman from Samaria who encounters Jesus at the well, leading to a significant theological conversation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sychar.htm">Sychar</a></b><br>- The town in Samaria where the disciples went to buy food, near the well where Jesus and the Samaritan woman meet.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_well.htm">Jacob's Well</a></b><br>- The historical site where the encounter takes place, significant in Jewish history as it was given by Jacob to his son Joseph.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointments.htm">Divine Appointments</a></b><br>Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman was not by chance.

The verse opens by reminding us that Jesus was not alone in His ministry; He had called a core group who &#8220;left everything and followed Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-11.htm">Luke 5:11</a>).<p>&#8226; These men were eyewitnesses of His works so they could later testify (<a href="/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Their temporary absence highlights how Jesus often arranged circumstances so individuals&#8212;like the Samaritan woman&#8212;could meet Him without distraction (<a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>).<p>&#8226; It also underscores that true discipleship involves practical service as well as preaching (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>; <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had gone</b><p>&#8226; The phrase signals purposeful movement; they weren&#8217;t wandering but fulfilling a need.<p>&#8226; Scripture frequently shows God using seemingly ordinary errands for larger purposes, as when Saul looked for donkeys and met Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-3.htm">1 Samuel 9:3-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Their going sets up a divine appointment between Jesus and the woman, illustrating <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> in real time.<p>&#8226; Obedience in small tasks keeps believers in step with greater kingdom plans (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the town</b><p>&#8226; The town was Sychar in Samaria (<a href="/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), a region Jews generally avoided (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By entering, the disciples were already crossing cultural barriers, though not yet grasping the full implication of <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>.<p>&#8226; Their comfort buying goods there yet surprise at Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>) exposes lingering prejudices&#8212;an issue the Lord would continue to address (<a href="/luke/9-52.htm">Luke 9:52-55</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that gospel ministry often begins where everyday life happens&#8212;in markets, streets, workplaces.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to buy food</b><p>&#8226; Physical hunger is real; even the Savior and His followers needed nourishment, stressing Jesus&#8217; true humanity (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Meeting material needs is part of faithful stewardship (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the scene prepares Jesus&#8217; later statement: &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>).<p>&#8226; This contrast invites us to seek first spiritual sustenance (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>; <a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>) while responsibly handling daily necessities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a> shows the disciples engaged in a simple errand that God folds into a larger redemptive encounter.<p>&#8226; Their absence gives the Samaritan woman uninterrupted access to Jesus, highlighting His personal care.<p>&#8226; The verse quietly challenges cultural biases, models practical obedience, affirms Jesus&#8217; humanity, and sets up a lesson on true nourishment.<p>&#8226; Even routine tasks are meaningful when they unfold under the sovereign direction of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">For</span> introduces His reason for asking this favour of her.

It will be remembered that the meat-offering did not consist of flesh, but of flour and oil and ears of corn (Leviticus 2).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For his disciples had departed into the city to buy food.</span> This is stated as a reason why he asked water from the chance wayfarer, who had obviously with her the "water pot" and the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (ver. 11), a word used for the rope with which the bucket or water jar was let down into the well. There are very discordant statements as to the degree of separation which the Jews insisted upon between themselves and Samaritans. The later rabbis greatly aggravated the feeling. They refused to eat the bread of Samaritans, as though it were more defiling than swine's flesh; objected to drink their wine or vinegar; and, if this animosity at the time of Christ had been equally pronounced, would have limited the disciples in their choice of food to uncooked eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and possibly to meal and wine. But it seems, from the earlier rabbinical books (Edersheim quotes several, which modify Lightfoot's authorities), that the meat of a Samaritan was lawful food if an Israelite had witnessed its killing, and that their bread, wine, etc., were not forbidden. We see no reason for thinking that Jesus was left absolutely alone on this occasion, and, from John's habitual method of avoiding direct mention of himself, it becomes perfectly possible that he was there listening silently to all these gracious words. Moulton cannot doubt that the beloved disciple subsequently received the whole from the Lord's own lips; but there is no reason to conclude that he must have been absent, and very much to suggest his quiet presence (Weiss, 'Life of Christ,' 2:34). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
