Jesus prepares His followers for His impending departure and the coming challenges. This forewarning is an act of love and care, ensuring they are not caught off guard by future events.<p><b>so that in Me you may have peace.</b><br>The peace Jesus offers is not the absence of conflict but a deep, abiding sense of well-being and assurance found only in Him. This peace is rooted in the relationship with Christ and is a fulfillment of the promise of peace given in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace." It contrasts with the temporary and often superficial peace the world offers.<p><b>In the world you will have tribulation.</b><br>Tribulation refers to the trials, persecutions, and hardships believers will face. This is a realistic acknowledgment of the Christian life, as seen in the early church's experiences in Acts and the epistles. The world, under the influence of sin and opposition to God, naturally brings challenges to those who follow Christ. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>.<p><b>But take courage;</b><br>Jesus calls His followers to be courageous in the face of adversity. This courage is not self-derived but is empowered by faith in Christ and the Holy Spirit's presence. The call to courage is a recurring biblical theme, seen in God's exhortations to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>) and throughout the Psalms.<p><b>I have overcome the world!&#8221;</b><br>This declaration of victory is central to Christian hope. Jesus' overcoming the world refers to His triumph over sin, death, and Satan through His death and resurrection. This victory is prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and fulfilled in the resurrection accounts. Believers share in this victory, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>, where Paul states that we are "more than conquerors" through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, offering comfort and assurance to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' message, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the fallen, sinful world system that is in opposition to God and His kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribulation.htm">Tribulation</a></b><br>The trials and challenges believers face as they live out their faith in a hostile world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace.htm">Peace</a></b><br>The inner tranquility and assurance that comes from a relationship with Jesus, despite external circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_in_christ.htm">Peace in Christ</a></b><br>True peace is found in a relationship with Jesus, not in the absence of trouble.<br><br>Believers are called to rest in the peace that Jesus provides, even amidst life's storms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reality_of_tribulation.htm">Reality of Tribulation</a></b><br>Jesus does not promise a trouble-free life but prepares us for the reality of trials.<br><br>Understanding that tribulation is part of the Christian journey helps us to rely on God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_through_christ's_victory.htm">Courage through Christ's Victory</a></b><br>Jesus' victory over the world is the foundation for our courage and hope.<br><br>Believers are encouraged to face challenges with confidence, knowing that Christ has already secured the ultimate victory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_through_faith.htm">Overcoming through Faith</a></b><br>Our faith in Jesus empowers us to overcome the world's challenges.<br><br>Living victoriously involves trusting in Jesus' power and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_overcomers.htm">Living as Overcomers</a></b><br>We are called to live as overcomers, reflecting Christ's victory in our daily lives.<br><br>This involves a mindset shift from defeat to victory, rooted in our identity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_16_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 16:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Finding_peace_in_Jesus_during_trials.htm">How does John 16:33 encourage us to find peace in Jesus amidst trials?

In the world, indeed, tribulation, but this as conquered in Him, and not interrupting the true peace in Him." The thought is closely allied to that of the last verse, "Alone and not alone;" "Troubled, and yet having peace." He had spoken of this from <a href="/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.">John 14:1</a> onwards, and from <a href="/john/15-18.htm" title="If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.">John 15:18</a> to <a href="/john/16-4.htm" title="But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.

The tone of these last triumphant words reminds them of the finest and noblest of his previous assurances, his promises of peace, courage, and victory over all the evil and power of this world) <span class="cmt_word">to you, that in me ye might have peace</span> (see note, <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27, 28</a>). The entire issue of the discourse is the conference on his disciples of his own secret of <span class="accented">peace - the</span> adequate support amid the crushing force and vehement hostility of the world (cf. <a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-4</a>, "Though the earth be removed.., there is a river," etc.). Peace is the balance of equilibrating forces; and man needs a Divine force behind and within him to encounter the tremendous odds arrayed against him, in mysteries of life, temptation of the devil, infirmity of the flesh, and antagonism of the world, so that we need not be surprised to hear him say, <span class="cmt_word">In the world ye have</span> <span class="cmt_word">tribulation</span>. It is the fundamental condition of Divine life in this world. Christ's disciples may take that for granted (see <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>), but the most striking and unique note of the true faith is that this sorrow is blended with an inward rapture which transforms it into peace. The blending of fear and love, of law with promise, of righteousness with mercy, of the sense of sin with that of pardon, of a great peace with a crushing tribulation, is one of the most constant tokens, signs, or marks of the mind of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">But be of good courage.</span> This is the practical uprising of the soul into the joy of the Lord (cf. also <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 28</a>). (The word itself is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in John, though found in <a href="/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a> and <a href="/mark/10-49.htm">Mark 10:49</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x27;&#x391;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I</span> - very emphatic - <span class="cmt_word">have overcome the world</span>. "A vous encore le combat, a mot des a present la victoire! Mats en mot la meme victoire a vous vous aussi" (Reuss). The royal sublimity of this last word, on the eve of the Passion, became one of the perpetually recurring thoughts of John (<a href="/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2, 3</a>, where the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is again and again referred to).
