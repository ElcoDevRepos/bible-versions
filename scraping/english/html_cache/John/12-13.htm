In the context of the Feast of Tabernacles, palm branches were used in worship (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>). The use of palm branches here signifies the people's recognition of Jesus as a victorious figure, possibly anticipating a political or military deliverance.<p><b>and went out to meet Him</b><br>The act of going out to meet Jesus indicates the people's eagerness and anticipation. This was a common practice for welcoming a dignitary or king, suggesting that the crowd viewed Jesus as a significant leader or messianic figure. This event took place as Jesus was entering Jerusalem, a city of great religious and political importance.<p><b>shouting: &#8220;Hosanna!&#8221;</b><br>"Hosanna" is a Hebrew expression meaning "Save, please" or "Save now," which over time became an exclamation of praise. The crowd's use of this term reflects their hope for deliverance and salvation, possibly expecting Jesus to liberate them from Roman rule. This echoes <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25-26</a>, a messianic psalm recited during the Feast of Tabernacles.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>, a psalm associated with messianic expectations. By proclaiming this blessing, the crowd acknowledges Jesus as one sent by God, fulfilling the role of the awaited Messiah. This declaration aligns with Jewish hopes for a divinely appointed leader who would restore Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed is the King of Israel!&#8221;</b><br>The title "King of Israel" underscores the crowd's recognition of Jesus as a royal figure, possibly the promised descendant of David who would establish God's kingdom. This acclamation reflects the messianic expectations of a political and national deliverer. However, Jesus' kingship is ultimately spiritual, as He later clarifies to Pilate (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).

They were branches of the palms growing on the spot, or possibly such as were in general use at festivities. For the word rendered "branches," comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/13-51.htm" title="And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.">1 Maccabees 13:51</a> ("branches of palm trees"), and for that rendered "palm trees," comp. <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm" title="After this I beheld, and, see, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;">Revelation 7:9</a>. Neither word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament.

That all the accounts differ is natural, and they have all preserved to us some distinctive acclamation with which the crowds welcomed Him whom they received as the Messiah. The 118th Psalm, from which these acclamations are taken (see <a href="/context/john/12-25.htm" title="He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.">John 12:25-26</a>), was currently interpreted as Messianic, and formed part of the Hallel chanted at Tabernacles and Passover.
