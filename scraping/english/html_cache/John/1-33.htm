This highlights the divine revelation necessary for recognizing Jesus' true identity. Despite being relatives (<a href="/luke/1-36.htm">Luke 1:36</a>), John emphasizes that his understanding of Jesus' messianic role was not based on familial ties but on divine revelation.<p><b>but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me</b><br>John's mission to baptize was divinely ordained, indicating his role as a forerunner to the Messiah. Baptism with water symbolizes repentance and preparation for the coming kingdom (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). The phrase underscores the authority and purpose behind John's ministry, as he was sent by God, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> about preparing the way for the Lord.<p><b>&#8216;The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest</b><br>This refers to the baptism of Jesus, where the Holy Spirit visibly descended upon Him like a dove (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). This event serves as a divine confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the anointed Messiah. The Spirit's descent and resting on Jesus signifies the beginning of His public ministry and fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah.<p><b>is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase contrasts John's baptism with water and Jesus' baptism with the Holy Spirit, indicating a new era of spiritual empowerment and transformation (<a href="/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>). The baptism with the Holy Spirit is associated with the New Covenant, where believers are indwelt and empowered by the Spirit, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a> about the outpouring of the Spirit.
