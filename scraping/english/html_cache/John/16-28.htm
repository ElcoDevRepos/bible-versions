It reflects the theological concept of the Trinity, where Jesus is one with the Father yet distinct in personhood. This aligns with <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word who was with God and was God, and who became flesh. The statement underscores Jesus' divine mission and authority, as He is not merely a prophet or teacher but the incarnate Son of God.<p><b>and entered the world.</b><br>This highlights the incarnation, where Jesus took on human form and lived among humanity. It signifies His willingness to humble Himself and experience human life, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>. The world, in this context, often represents a realm opposed to God, filled with sin and darkness. Jesus' entry into the world was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which foretold the coming of Immanuel, "God with us." His presence in the world was to bring light, salvation, and the revelation of God's love.<p><b>In turn, I will leave the world</b><br>This phrase foreshadows Jesus' impending death, resurrection, and ascension. It indicates the temporary nature of His earthly ministry and His return to the Father. The departure is not a defeat but a necessary step in the redemptive plan, as His death would atone for sin and His resurrection would conquer death. This transition is crucial for the coming of the Holy Spirit, as Jesus explains in <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>, which would empower the disciples to continue His work.<p><b>and go to the Father.&#8221;</b><br>This completes the cycle of Jesus' mission, returning to the Father after accomplishing His work on earth. It signifies His exaltation and the restoration of His glory, as seen in <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. The ascension is a pivotal event, marking Jesus' victory over sin and death and His ongoing intercession for believers at the right hand of God, as described in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>. This return also assures believers of their future hope, as Jesus prepares a place for them, as promised in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is speaking about His divine origin, earthly mission, and return to the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, emphasizing the intimate relationship and unity between Jesus and the Father.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents the earthly realm where Jesus carried out His ministry and mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the audience to whom Jesus is speaking, preparing them for His departure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ascension.htm">The Ascension</a></b><br>The event implied in this verse where Jesus will return to the Father after His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_mission.htm">Divine Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' statement underscores His divine mission and purpose.

Heaven, and not earth, is My home. I leave the world again and return to the Father."
