It is a time of remembrance and celebration of God's protection and salvation. The timing of this event is crucial, as it sets the stage for the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, which occurs during Passover. This connection highlights Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb, fulfilling the sacrificial system and pointing to His role in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Jewish people, housing the Temple where sacrifices were made. During Passover, Jews from all over Israel and beyond would travel to Jerusalem to participate in the festival. The phrase "went up" is geographically accurate, as Jerusalem is situated on a hill, and pilgrims would ascend to the city. This pilgrimage underscores the importance of communal worship and the centrality of Jerusalem in Jewish religious life.<p><b>to purify themselves before the Passover</b><br>Purification was a critical aspect of Jewish law, especially before participating in significant religious festivals like Passover. Ritual purification involved various practices, such as washing and abstaining from certain activities, to ensure ceremonial cleanliness. This practice is rooted in the Mosaic Law, which emphasizes holiness and separation from impurity. The need for purification before Passover highlights the seriousness with which the Jews approached their relationship with God and their desire to be in a state of readiness to commemorate His deliverance. This purification process can also be seen as a type pointing to the ultimate purification from sin that Jesus provides through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_passover.htm">Jewish Passover</a></b><br>An annual festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian slavery, as described in Exodus.
