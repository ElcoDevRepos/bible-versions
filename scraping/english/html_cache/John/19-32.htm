One thief dies in unbelief; the other, in faith, illustrating the eternal divide every person faces when confronted with Christ.

The mention of the "first" and the "other" suggests that they formed two pairs, and began on either side breaking the legs of the thieves crucified with Jesus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first</span> - two of the quaternion employed on the one deed, and two on the other - and of the other which was crucified with him. <span class="cmt_word">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they brake not his legs.</span> Their barbarous mercy was unnecessary, and John caw in this another correspondence with the sacred symbolism and prophetic anticipations of the Old Testament. <span class="cmt_word">But one of the soldiers pierced</span> - gashed, probably, for the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used in both senses - <span class="cmt_word">his side with a spear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;</span>, a lance, a heavy formidable weapon) to give him the coup de grace, should their expectation not be actually realized, <span class="cmt_word">and forthwith came there-out blood and water.</span> We do not enter into the numerous physiological reasons which have been advanced by Gruner, Bartholinus, and Dr. Stroud ('Physical Cause of the Death of Christ') for this event, but regard it as one of the great portents of the Crucifixion, which cannot be entirely explained as some physiologists have done. Dr. Schaff appears willing to accept the hypothesis that the extravagated blood, being first separated into its two constituents, was thus liberated from the pericardium - a phenomenon that might seem to justify the supposition of the evangelist, that it was blood and water. Dr. Stroud endeavored, with much medical learning, to show that this might follow the side-piercing if the Lord's physical death had followed, as he argued, from rupture of the heart due to his intense agonies. Sir R. Bennett has accepted this solution. Nor, further, do we see here any reference to the sacramental system of which John elsewhere says so little; but we do see a token miraculously given of the twofold power of his redemptive life and work <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> renovation, refreshment, rivers of living water issuing from the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> of Christ, the first great rush of spiritual power which was to regenerate humanity; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the expression of that redemptive process which was effected in the positive shedding of his precious blood. It was, moreover, a proof and sign given to Roman soldiers that their Victim was actually dead. We cannot think, with Westcott, that it was a kind of sign of the commencement of the resurrection-life, which goes perilously near to the assertion that he never really died. Moulton argues that the phenomena were physiologically possible if the-event occurred immediately after death. There is nothing in the narrative to prevent such juxtaposition. That John should have witnessed it, and been unable to understand it, and therefore put it down among the marvels of the Crucifixion, corroborates the veracity of the eye-witness (Webster and Wilkinson). The interesting catena of patristic interpretations given by Westcott ('Additional Note') shows that the earliest writer who refers to the marvel, Claudius Apollinaris, regarded it as expressive of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "the Word and the Spirit." Origen showed that from a corpse such a phenomenon could not occur; and so even in his death there are still the signs of the living one. Cyril of Jerusalem saw the two baptisms of blood and water; Chrysostom, the two sacraments, or the mysteries of baptism and of the flesh and blood. <span class="accented">Macarius Magnes</span> and <span class="accented">Apollinarius</span> saw an allusion to the side of Adam, from which Eve, the source of evil, was taken; that now the side of the second Adam should give forth the means of salvation and deliverance. Tertullian dwells on the two baptisms of water and blood; so Jerome; while Augustine sees in it the laver and the cup. That there was some special, abnormal phenomenon seems specially noticeable from the emphasis which the eye-witness lays upon the observation and record of the fact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
