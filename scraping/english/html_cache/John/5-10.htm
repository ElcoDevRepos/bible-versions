The term "the Jews" often refers to the religious authorities, such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were responsible for maintaining religious law and order. In the context of the Gospel of John, this group frequently opposes Jesus and His works. The man who had been healed was previously an invalid for 38 years, emphasizing the miraculous nature of his healing and the authority of Jesus over physical ailments.<p><b>&#8220;This is the Sabbath!</b><br>The Sabbath is a day of rest and worship observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, as commanded in the Fourth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). It is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, symbolizing rest and holiness. The Jewish leaders were zealous in their observance of the Sabbath, often adding extra-biblical traditions and interpretations to ensure its sanctity. This context sets the stage for the conflict between Jesus' actions and the leaders' interpretation of the law.<p><b>It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.&#8221;</b><br>The prohibition against carrying burdens on the Sabbath is derived from passages like <a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-22</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-19</a>, where carrying loads on the Sabbath is condemned. The Jewish leaders had developed an extensive list of activities considered work, which included carrying objects from one domain to another. By instructing the healed man to carry his mat, Jesus challenges the prevailing interpretation of the Sabbath law, emphasizing mercy and the spirit of the law over rigid legalism. This incident foreshadows the broader conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities regarding the true purpose of the Sabbath and the nature of God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders or authorities who were strict about the observance of the Sabbath laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_had_been_healed.htm">The Man Who Had Been Healed</a></b><br>A man who had been an invalid for 38 years and was healed by Jesus at the Pool of Bethesda.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship observed by the Jews, based on the commandment to keep the seventh day holy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem where the healing took place, known for its supposed healing properties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who performed the healing and challenged the prevailing interpretations of the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is a gift from God meant for rest and spiritual renewal, not a burden of legalistic rules.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legalism_vs._compassion.htm">Legalism vs. Compassion</a></b><br>Jesus challenges the legalistic interpretation of the law, emphasizing compassion and mercy over strict rule-following.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_jesus.htm">The Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His authority over the Sabbath, pointing to His divine nature and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_tradition.htm">The Role of Tradition</a></b><br>Traditions should not overshadow the core principles of faith, such as love, mercy, and justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_faith.htm">Living Out Faith</a></b><br>Our actions should reflect the spirit of the law, focusing on love and service rather than mere compliance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_10_s_impact_on_Sabbath_today.htm">How does John 5:10 challenge our understanding of Sabbath observance today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_5_10_Pharisees_focus_on_law.htm">What does John 5:10 reveal about the Pharisees' priorities and legalism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_Pharisees_error_in_John_5_10.htm">How can we avoid the Pharisees' mistake in John 5:10 in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_texts_compassion_vs_legalism.htm">What other scriptures emphasize the importance of compassion over legalism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_mercy_over_sacrifice_daily.htm">How can we apply the principle of mercy over sacrifice in our daily actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_object_to_mat-carrying_on_Sabbath.htm">Why did the Jews object to carrying a mat on the Sabbath in John 5:10?

The leaders ignored that fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the Sabbath!</b><p>- The Sabbath was established by God at creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and commanded in the Law (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>); it was a gift of rest (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p>- Jesus often chose the Sabbath for acts of mercy&#8212;healing the man with the withered hand (<a href="/matthew/12-10.htm">Matthew 12:10-13</a>), the bent-over woman (<a href="/luke/13-10.htm">Luke 13:10-16</a>), and the blind man (<a href="/john/9-14.htm">John 9:14</a>)&#8212;because &#8220;it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-12.htm">Matthew 12:12</a>).<p>- By declaring the miracle day more important than the miracle itself, the leaders inverted God&#8217;s priorities (<a href="/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is unlawful for you to carry your mat</b><p>- The Mosaic Law forbade ordinary work on the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>), and prophets warned against commercial burdens (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-22</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-19</a>).<p>- Over time, oral tradition expanded that command into thirty-nine categories of prohibited labor, including carrying any object in public. The leaders treated their additions as divine law (<a href="/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>).<p>- Jesus later answers them: &#8220;My Father is still working, and I also am working&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), asserting His authority as Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>).<p>- Their legalism exposed hearts hardened against grace; instead of rejoicing, they objected, plotting against the One who had just displayed God&#8217;s power (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10</a> reveals a clash between human tradition and God&#8217;s compassion. Religious leaders, blinded by man-made rules, scold a newly healed man for carrying the very mat that once symbolized his bondage. The verse exposes legalism that values regulation over redemption, setting the conflict that will ultimately reveal Jesus as both Healer and Lord of the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The Jews therefore said unto him.</span>--But what they cannot deny they can cavil at. One might have expected from human hearts wonder and thankfulness that the man could walk at all. We find from the formalism which had bound the letter round men until it had well nigh crushed all heart out of them, the murmur that the carrying of his bed was not lawful on the Sabbath. This is not the only place in this Gospel where the words and works of Christ clashed with the current views of the sanctity of the Sabbath day. (Comp. <a href="/john/7-23.htm" title="If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?">John 7:23</a>; <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>.) The general question has been treated in Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-10.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.">Matthew 12:10-12</a>. Here it will be sufficient to note that the bearing of burdens was specially forbidden in the Prophecy of Jeremiah: "Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:21</a>; comp. <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.">Nehemiah 13:15</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and that the Rabbis pressed this to include a burden of any kind. They said, for example, "If any man on the Sabbath bring in or take out anything on the Sabbath from a public to a private place, if thoughtlessly he hath done this he shall sacrifice for his sin; but if wilfully, he shall be cut off and shall be stoned."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9b-16.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The outbreak of hostility due to the breach of the sabbatic law.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now it was the sabbath on that day</span>. The form of the expression implies that it was one of the festival sabbaths rather than the weekly sabbath. These days, however, received the same reverence, and were observed with nearly the same rites and restrictions, as the ordinary sabbaths. This statement is the keynote of the great discourse which fellows, and it is made to prepare the way for the subsequent incidents. <span class="accented">The Jews</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the authorities, either the rabbis or Sanhedrists who were present in the crowd which gathered round the pool of Bethesda, or filled the neighbouring courts, are to be distinguished from "the multitude," or from the people generally. The designation evidently means the leading folk, the social censors, the hierarchy, who very soon displayed in marked fashion their jealousy and hatred of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore said to the man who</span> <span class="cmt_word">had been healed, It is sabbath,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</span> Judging by the letter of the Law (<a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a> and Exodus 35:3), and by the precedents of Scripture (<a href="/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-35</a>), and by the special injunctions of the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>, etc.), the man was infringing a positive command. Rabbinism had indeed declared that, in cases affecting life and health, the law of the sabbath was legitimately held in abeyance; but this relaxation was so hedged about with restrictions that the poor man and the layman were unable to apply the rules. The rabbinic interpretations of the sabbatic law concerning burden bearing were so intricate and sophistical that the entire majesty of the law, and the merciful intent of the prohibition, were concealed and vitiated. Apart from these complications, the man was <span class="accented">prima facie</span> disobeying the letter of the law. 'Shabbath,' fol. 6, <span class="accented">a</span>, declares that if unwittingly a burden was carried on the sabbath, the transgressor was bound to bring a sin offering; if with knowledge, he must be stoned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
