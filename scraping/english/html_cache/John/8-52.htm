In the cultural and historical context, attributing demonic possession to someone was a serious charge, often used to discredit and delegitimize a person's authority or teachings. This statement reveals the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart among the religious leaders, who could not recognize Jesus as the Messiah. Similar accusations are found in other parts of the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>, where the Pharisees claim Jesus casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul.<p><b>declared the Jews.</b><br>The term "the Jews" in the Gospel of John often refers to the Jewish religious authorities rather than the Jewish people as a whole. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of His time. Historically, these leaders were concerned about maintaining their power and influence, which they felt was threatened by Jesus' growing popularity and His radical teachings.<p><b>Abraham died, and so did the prophets,</b><br>Abraham and the prophets are revered figures in Jewish history, representing the foundation of Jewish faith and tradition. By mentioning their deaths, the Jewish leaders are emphasizing the inevitability of physical death, even for the most righteous individuals. This statement underscores their misunderstanding of Jesus' promise of eternal life, which is spiritual rather than physical. The reference to Abraham also connects to earlier discussions in <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, where Jesus speaks of His pre-existence and relationship with Abraham.<p><b>yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.</b><br>Jesus' promise of eternal life to those who keep His word is a central theme in His teachings. This statement highlights the contrast between physical death and spiritual life. In <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>, Jesus declares Himself the resurrection and the life, reinforcing the idea that belief in Him transcends physical death. The phrase "never taste death" is a metaphor for eternal separation from God, which Jesus promises to overcome for His followers. This promise is rooted in the new covenant, prophesied in the Old Testament, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>In this context, the term refers to the religious leaders and people who were questioning Jesus' claims and authority.

They regard it as conclusive that their assertion in <a href="/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a> is correct.

These words have scattered their momentary hesitation. They must have reasoned thus: "He who claims such power for his own words must have personal immunity from death. This is a daemoniacal folly and delusion. There have been greater than he who heard and kept the words of <span class="accented">God</span>, and who, nevertheless, did not escape death." <span class="cmt_word">Abraham died, and the prophets</span> (died); <span class="cmt_word">and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</span> Here observe the wilful alteration of the Saviour's words. In place of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "the word that is mine," they quote him as saying, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my word," "the word of me" which conveys a more personal claim; and again, in lieu of the remarkable phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, they say, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> equivalent to "shall not in any way experience death" - a form of expression incompatible with the fact of the physical death of his followers and <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">fortiori</span> of himself.
