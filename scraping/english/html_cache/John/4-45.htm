The journey from Judea to Galilee was significant, as it involved traveling through Samaria, where Jesus had the notable encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well. This return to Galilee is part of Jesus' broader ministry, which often involved moving between regions to spread His teachings and perform miracles.<p><b>the Galileans welcomed Him</b><br>The welcoming of Jesus by the Galileans contrasts with His earlier rejection in Nazareth, His hometown (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a>). Galilee was a region known for its mixed population and diverse cultural influences, which may have made its people more open to Jesus' message. The Galileans' reception of Jesus highlights the growing recognition of His authority and the impact of His previous works.<p><b>They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast</b><br>This refers to the Passover feast in Jerusalem, where Jesus performed miracles and taught with authority (<a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a>). The "great things" likely include the cleansing of the temple and other signs that demonstrated His divine authority. The Passover was a major Jewish festival, drawing people from all over, including Galilee, which explains why the Galileans were aware of His deeds.<p><b>for they had gone there as well</b><br>This indicates that many Galileans traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover, a pilgrimage required by Jewish law (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). Their presence in Jerusalem allowed them to witness Jesus' actions firsthand, contributing to their positive reception of Him upon His return to Galilee.

The royal official in Cana (<a href="/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46-53</a>) illustrates how sign-awakened interest can mature into saving belief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;great things&#8221; refer to the signs Jesus performed during Passover (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-22</a>).

Their firsthand experience fuels their excitement back home.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;great things&#8221; confirms the historic reality of Jesus&#8217; miraculous works, echoing later testimonies of Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>) and the crowd in <a href="/john/7-31.htm">John 7:31</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they had gone there as well</b><p>&#8226; The Galileans&#8217; presence in Jerusalem ties regional faith to national worship.

The gospel thus spreads along well-worn travel routes established by God&#8217;s law.<p>&#8226; Their participation reminds us that obedience to revealed commands (pilgrimage feasts) positioned them to witness Christ&#8217;s power&#8212;an encouragement to place ourselves consistently where God&#8217;s Word is proclaimed (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a> records a warm Galilean reception based on signs witnessed at Passover. Jesus&#8217; return to Galilee, though seemingly at odds with the proverb about a prophet&#8217;s honor, reveals divine timing and purpose. The welcome is genuine enthusiasm but not yet mature faith, pointing to the need for belief rooted in Christ&#8217;s word rather than miracles alone (<a href="/john/4-50.htm">John 4:50, 53</a>).
