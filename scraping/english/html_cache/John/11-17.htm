The timing of His arrival is significant, as it follows His deliberate delay after hearing of Lazarus's illness. This delay serves to highlight the divine purpose and timing in Jesus' actions, emphasizing His sovereignty and the glory of God that would be revealed through the forthcoming miracle.<p><b>He found that Lazarus</b><br>Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, is a key figure in this narrative. His name, meaning "God has helped," foreshadows the miraculous intervention that Jesus is about to perform. Lazarus's relationship with Jesus is one of deep friendship, underscoring the personal nature of Jesus' ministry and His compassion for individuals.<p><b>had already spent four days</b><br>The mention of four days is crucial in the Jewish context, as it was commonly believed that the soul lingered near the body for three days after death, hoping to return. By the fourth day, decomposition was thought to have set in, making any hope of resuscitation impossible. This detail underscores the hopelessness of the situation from a human perspective and sets the stage for a miracle that defies natural expectations.<p><b>in the tomb</b><br>Tombs in first-century Judea were typically caves or carved into rock, often sealed with a stone. The burial practices of the time involved wrapping the body in linen and anointing it with spices. The tomb symbolizes death's finality and the separation it causes, which Jesus is about to overcome. This setting also prefigures Jesus' own burial and resurrection, drawing a parallel between Lazarus's temporary return to life and Jesus' victory over death itself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

(Comp. <a href="/context/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6-10</a>.) The whole tone of the narrative places the time of death at the point indicated by the summons to go into Judaea, in <a href="/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a> (see Note there). Counting the parts of the days on which they set out and on which they arrived as included in the four days, in accordance with the Jewish method, we have two whole days and parts of two other days spent upon the journey. There is no indication that they halted on the way, but everything suggests rather that they went as quickly as possible. The common view, which supposes the place where John was baptising to have been on the southern Jordan, cannot be made consistent with this long journey; and it is usual to assume that Lazarus died on the day that the message reached the Lord, that after his death our Lord remained two days where He was, and that the fourth day was occupied on the journey to Bethany. It is believed that the meaning of the narrative is brought out more fully by the interpretation which has been followed above, and that the four days for the journey is perfectly natural on the supposition which has been adopted, that the journey was from <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> which was north of the Sea of Galilee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span>; or, <span class="accented">thereupon</span>; for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> not infrequently indicates the relation between two narratives, as well as between two state-meats or arguments. <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus came into the neighborhood of the village</span> (see ver. 30), <span class="cmt_word">he found, on inquiry, that he</span> (Lazarus) <span class="cmt_word">already</span> <span class="cmt_word">during four days had been</span> <span class="cmt_word">in the grave</span>; or literally, <span class="accented">had had four days</span>. These four days are differently counted. Alford, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Lange, Gorier, Westcott, and Moulton believe that this mention proves that Lazarus died and was buried on the day on which the message was sent, which, if it took one day to deliver, and if one day had been consumed in the return of Jesus, would leave the other two days as those of the delay in Peraea. Meyer and Ewald, with Bengel and Watkins, think that he died at the conclusion of the <span class="accented">delay</span>, that Jesus became aware of it, and told his disciples of it, and spent the two days, or parts of them, in the journey; that on the fourth day he reached Bethany. The former and usual view is the more obvious one, although it must turn ultimately on the position of Bethany beyond Jordan. If the recent speculations of the Palestine Exploration Society and Caspari be correct, the distance between the two Bethanys may have required at least two days for the journey, and therefore favors the latter interpretation. If Bethany (Bethabara) be near Jericho, the distance between them would be much less, and the former and usual reckoning must prevail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
