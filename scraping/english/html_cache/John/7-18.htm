In the cultural context of first-century Judea, religious leaders often sought personal recognition and status. This is evident in the behavior of the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were known for their public displays of piety (<a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5-7</a>). The phrase warns against the dangers of self-glorification, which can lead to pride and a departure from God's truth. It echoes the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/proverbs/25-27.htm">Proverbs 25:27</a>, which cautions against seeking one's own honor.<p><b>but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Jesus' mission to glorify God the Father. Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus emphasizes that He is sent by the Father (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>, <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>). This mission is rooted in the prophetic tradition, where prophets were sent by God to deliver His message (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). Jesus, as the ultimate fulfillment of the prophetic office, perfectly embodies this divine commission. His actions and teachings consistently point back to the Father, demonstrating His obedience and submission to God's will.<p><b>is a man of truth</b><br>The phrase "a man of truth" underscores the integrity and reliability of Jesus' character. In the biblical context, truth is not merely factual accuracy but aligns with God's nature and purposes. Jesus embodies truth, as He later declares, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This concept of truth is deeply rooted in the Hebrew understanding of faithfulness and covenant loyalty (<a href="/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>). Jesus' life and ministry are a testament to His unwavering commitment to God's truth.<p><b>in Him there is no falsehood</b><br>This final phrase affirms the sinlessness and moral perfection of Jesus. Unlike human leaders who may be prone to deceit or error, Jesus is without fault or deception. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that presents Jesus as the spotless Lamb of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The absence of falsehood in Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). It also serves as a foundation for the trustworthiness of His teachings and the salvation He offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the crowd during the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem, teaching about His divine mission and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience includes Jewish leaders and common people who are questioning Jesus' teachings and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where this event takes place, significant as the religious and cultural center of Jewish life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival during which Jesus is teaching, symbolizing God's provision and presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_sent_him.htm">The One who sent Him</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, emphasizing Jesus' divine mission and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_and_glory.htm">Authority and Glory</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that true authority comes from God, and those who speak on their own authority seek their own glory.

(See Notes on <a href="/context/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41-44</a>.) They contrast His position and that of His hearers. Professional teachers, they sought glory one from another, and regarded their teaching as of themselves, the special honour of their caste. In the pride of their own knowledge they willed not the glory of God, and so had not the faculty to know and receive His teaching. He sought the will of Him that sent Him, and therefore was true, in harmony with the eternal will of God. The effect of the submission of His will to the Father's, and His seeking in word and work the Father's glory, was that there was no possibility of unrighteousness in Him. This emphasis laid upon truth and righteousness has reference to the charges which they are plotting against Him, and which have already been expressed in the murmuring of the multitude (<a href="/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>). The words are clearly to be explained with special reference to their position and His, but the general form of the expressions, "He that speaketh of himself . . ." "He that seeketh His glory . . ." show that this is not the exclusive reference. They, too, hold good of every man who speaketh of himself, and of every man who seeketh the glory of Him that sent Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The following sentence is perfectly general and applicable to all teachers of Divine truth, though it only reaches its highest expression in Christ himself. But while it has numerous applications, its first use is to ratify the previous statements, and prepare the way for what is to follow. <span class="cmt_word">He that speaketh from himself.</span> This was an act which he, in his own case, disclaimed. The "himself" was here the personality which then was in question as a human Teacher. <span class="accented">He that speaketh from himself</span> as the Source of all his instructions. He who would take the credit of being the primal Cause and Orion of the message which he delivers is a man who <span class="cmt_word">seeketh his own glory,</span> his own reputation, at the expense of those who instructed him. The Jewish schoolmen were most anxious at all times to found their instructions on Rabbi "This," or "That," who had himself quoted from some more ancient father of their erudition. A man who should presume to teach in his own name would be one who was manifestly not seeking any higher end than his own glory. Ambition of personal glory and renown is the very thing the absence of which the multitude condemned in Christ's case. The brethren of Jesus had tauuted him with the lack of bold self assertion. Our Lord's own position just taken was that his teaching was not self-originated, but was the teaching or message "of him that sent him." <span class="cmt_word">But whoso</span> (he added) <span class="cmt_word">seeketh the glory of him that sent him</span>, whether the sender be a mortal man and earthly teacher, or be the Lord God of the whole world, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whoso loses his own individual purpose in the will of God, and is content to be nothing so that God may be glorified," <span class="cmt_word">this person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is true,</span> trustworthy; his message is not perverted by any of the contaminating influences of the self-hood, or flesh, <span class="cmt_word">and there is no unrighteousness</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)diki/a</span> is a stronger antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> than <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is. It is the moral basis out of which falsehood springs) - <span class="cmt_word">no unrighteousness in him.</span> The sentence is general, but has its prime application to Christ's own ease. It is a reply to the charge that "he deceiveth the people." It is a further challenge to those who are willing to do the will of God. It is a summons to proceed a step further, and recognize the fact that the glory of God, and not his own glory, was the sole end of his teaching, and that the direct command from him that sent him formed the substance of his doctrine, however much it might clash with their preconceived ideas or dominant prejudices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
