His action of motioning suggests a non-verbal communication, indicating the close relationship and understanding among the disciples. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where gestures were a common form of communication. Peter's leadership role is consistent with other scriptural accounts, such as his confession of Christ in <a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a> and his prominent role in the early church as seen in Acts.<p><b>to ask Jesus</b><br>Peter's desire to seek clarification from Jesus highlights the disciples' dependence on Him for understanding spiritual matters. This moment occurs during the Last Supper, a significant event where Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending crucifixion. The act of asking Jesus directly underscores the intimate teacher-student relationship they shared. It also reflects the Jewish tradition of disciples seeking wisdom from their rabbi.<p><b>which one He was talking about.</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' earlier statement about one of the disciples betraying Him. The context is crucial, as it takes place during the Last Supper, a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative. The question of betrayal fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. This inquiry sets the stage for the revelation of Judas Iscariot as the betrayer, a key event in the unfolding of the Passion story. The disciples' concern and confusion also highlight their human frailty and foreshadow the trials they will face after Jesus' arrest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong leadership among the apostles.

"Simon Peter therefore beckons," or, <span class= "ital">makes a sign.</span> We have to remember that these Apostles were both members of the first group, who are from some special characteristics nearer to our Lord than the others. They had both been disciples of the Baptist (<a href="/context/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40-41</a>), and we may think of them in the earlier as in the later work as in a special sense companions and friends.

Westcott imagines that Peter was on the <span class="accented">left</span> side, in the place of real honor (?), though not in such proximity as, unobserved, to ask the question. Edersheim also speaks of the <span class="accented">left</span> side as the place of honor, but assigns no adequate reason for such a violation of universal usage and metaphor. The natural impetuosity of Peter would have induced him, if he had been so near, to have asked the question himself. It is more probable that Judas himself was there, judging from the language of <a href="/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>, and from the act which follows.
