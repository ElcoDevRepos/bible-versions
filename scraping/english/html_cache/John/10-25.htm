This reflects a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, where Jesus often speaks plainly about His identity and mission, yet many do not understand or accept His words. This statement underscores the persistent unbelief of the religious leaders despite Jesus' clear teachings and previous declarations about Himself (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, <a href="/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>).<p><b>"but you did not believe."</b><br>Here, Jesus highlights the issue of unbelief, which is a central theme in the Gospel of John. Despite witnessing Jesus' miracles and hearing His teachings, the religious leaders remain skeptical. This unbelief is not due to a lack of evidence but rather a hardness of heart, as seen throughout the Gospel (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37-40</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative of Israel's history, where prophets were often rejected despite their clear messages from God (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>"The works I do in My Father&#8217;s name"</b><br>Jesus refers to His miracles and teachings as works done in the authority and power of God the Father. This phrase emphasizes the divine origin and purpose of Jesus' ministry. In the cultural and historical context, performing works in someone's name meant acting with their authority and approval. Jesus' miracles, such as healing the blind and raising the dead, serve as signs pointing to His divine nature and messianic role (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, <a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10-11</a>).<p><b>"testify on My behalf."</b><br>The works of Jesus serve as a testimony to His identity as the Son of God and the promised Messiah. In Jewish legal tradition, testimony was crucial for establishing truth, and Jesus' miracles function as divine testimony to His claims (<a href="/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31-39</a>). This aligns with the prophetic expectation of the Messiah performing signs and wonders (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>). Jesus' works are not just acts of compassion but are also meant to reveal His divine authority and fulfill Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Jewish leaders questioning His identity as the Messiah.

Unbelief is a moral choice (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>) that hardens the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>) and blinds the mind (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>).

And Jesus said to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.">John 8:25</a>, where a similar direct question was put to Him, the answer is indirect. It could not be otherwise. Their misconception of the Messianic work had made the very word Messiah an impossible one for Him to utter to them. To have said He was the Messiah would have been to sanction their thought of Him as a temporal prince; to have said that He was not would have been to contradict the essential truth. He refers them, then, to His earlier words and deeds in proof of what He was. To inquirers of simpler hearts, as the woman of Samaria and the man born blind, He had used the word Messiah.

The reply of Jesus is full of wisdom. If he had at once given an affirmative answer, they would have misunderstood him, because he was not the Christ of their expectations. If he had denied that he was the Messiah, he would have been untrue to his deepest consciousness of reality. The answer was: <span class="cmt_word">I spake with you</span> - told you what I am - <span class="cmt_word">and ye believe not</span>. To the woman in Samaria, to the Capernaites, to the blind man, to Peter and the other apostles, and in several emphatic forms, he had admitted his Messiahship.
