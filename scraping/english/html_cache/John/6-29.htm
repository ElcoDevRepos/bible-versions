This interaction takes place in Capernaum, a significant location in Jesus' ministry. The crowd is seeking more signs and wonders, reflecting a common expectation of the Messiah as a provider of physical needs. Jesus' reply shifts the focus from physical sustenance to spiritual truth.<p><b>The work of God is this</b><br>This phrase challenges the prevailing Jewish understanding of works and the Law. In Jewish tradition, adherence to the Law and performing good works were seen as pathways to righteousness. Jesus redefines "work" not as a series of actions but as a singular act of faith. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that salvation is by faith, not by works, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>.<p><b>To believe</b><br>Belief, in this context, is not mere intellectual assent but a deep, personal trust and reliance on Jesus. This belief is transformative, leading to eternal life. The Greek word used here, "pisteuo," implies a continuous, active trust. This concept is echoed throughout the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul, who emphasizes faith as the means of justification.<p><b>In the One He has sent</b><br>This phrase identifies Jesus as the sent One, a theme prevalent in John's Gospel. It underscores Jesus' divine mission and authority, as He is sent by the Father. This concept of being sent is rooted in Old Testament prophecy, where the Messiah is depicted as God's chosen servant (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). Jesus fulfills these prophecies, embodying the role of the suffering servant and the ultimate revelation of God to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about what God requires.

To believe on Him whom God hath sent is already to have the spiritual life which is eternal. The contrast of the words comes to us across the discussions of many centuries, speaking to the angry waves which arise in men's souls and bidding them be still. Faith and work, then, are one. As soul and body, they together make one life. The energy of every work is in the faith which links the soul with God; the outcome of all faith is in the act which links the soul with man. The work of life is faith; and "faith worketh by love" (<a href="/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Christ's reply really solves the great problem which had long perplexed the schools of Palestine, and often, and even to the present hour, is dividing into two hostile camps the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God.</span> Observe, not "works," but "work" - the one work which is the germ and the consummation of all the partial workings which are often made substitutes for it. There is "one work" which God would have man do. Jesus admits that there is something to do (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) - there is a labour, an effort of the will needed to do what God requires; and this is evident enough as soon as this great work is described, viz. <span class="cmt_word">That ye believe on him whom he</span> (the Father) <span class="cmt_word">sent</span>; or, <span class="accented">hath sent</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f3d;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, here preferred by the R.T. to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (see <a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>), marks the simple fact and continuous act of believing with the effort tending to such result; while the aorist would have pointed to one definite act of faith (see Westcott).. To "believe on him," to habitually entrust one's self to the power and grace of Christ, to make a full moral surrender of the soul to the Lord, includes in itself all other work, and is in itself the great work of God. "It is the Christian answer to the Jewish question" (Thoma). "Faith is the life of works, works the necessity of faith" (Westcott). "Faith is the highest kind of work, for by it man gives himself to God, and a free being can do nothing greater than give himself: St. James opposes work to a faith which would be nothing but intellectual belief. St. Paul opposes faith, active faith, to works of mere observance. The 'faith' of St. Paul is really the 'work' of St. James, according to this sovereign formula of Jesus, 'This is the work of God, that ye believe'" (Godet). Luther says, "To depend on God's Word, so that the heart is not terrified by sin and death, but trusts and believes in God, is a much severer and more difficult thing than the Carthusians or all orders of monks demand." Schleiermachcr says, "This is the most significant declaration, that all eternal life proceeds from nothing else than faith in Christ." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(Apekrith&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
