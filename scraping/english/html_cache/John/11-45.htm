The context is the aftermath of the raising of Lazarus, which took place in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem. The Jews mentioned here were likely friends, family, or mourners who had come to console Mary and Martha after the death of their brother Lazarus. This reflects the Jewish custom of mourning, where community members would gather to offer support. The presence of many Jews also highlights the significance of the miracle, as it was witnessed by a substantial number of people.<p><b>and had seen what Jesus did</b><br>This refers to the miraculous act of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, which is one of the most significant miracles recorded in the Gospels. The act of raising someone from the dead is a powerful demonstration of Jesus' divine authority and power over life and death. This miracle serves as a sign pointing to Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the coming of one who would have power over death (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). It also prefigures Jesus' own resurrection, emphasizing His role as the resurrection and the life (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p><b>believed in Him</b><br>The result of witnessing the miracle was that many of the Jews believed in Jesus. This belief is not merely intellectual assent but a trust and faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The Gospel of John frequently emphasizes belief as a response to Jesus' signs and teachings (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>). This belief is transformative, leading to eternal life and a relationship with God. The phrase underscores the purpose of Jesus' miracles: to reveal His identity and to lead people to faith. The response of belief contrasts with the opposition Jesus faced from some religious leaders, highlighting the division His ministry caused among the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>This refers to the Jewish people who were present at the scene.

The miracle was undeniable and witnessed by a substantial crowd (<a href="/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19</a>).<p>- These were Jewish mourners, friends, and neighbors who had seen Lazarus dead and buried. Their collective testimony adds weight, echoing the principle of multiple witnesses in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>.<p>- John often records varied reactions from Jewish observers (<a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19-21</a>). Here, the majority side with faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had come to Mary</b><p>- They had originally arrived to comfort Mary and Martha in their grief (<a href="/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19</a>).

These people didn&#8217;t rely on rumor; they saw the stone rolled away, heard Jesus&#8217; command, and watched Lazarus walk out.<p>- Throughout John&#8217;s Gospel, seeing Christ&#8217;s works leads to belief (<a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="/john/9-38.htm">John 9:38</a>).<p>- This reinforces that faith is not blind credulity but trust grounded in God&#8217;s revealed actions (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>believed in Him</b><p>- The phrase signals a decisive, personal trust in Jesus as Messiah.

The verse assures us that God&#8217;s works still bring people from sorrow to saving belief when eyes are open to see and hearts are ready to respond.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(45) <span class= "bld">Then many of the Jews which came to-Mary, and had seen . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Many therefore of the Jews, which had come to Mary and seen .</span> . .

The miracle is so utterly beyond all their conceptions that it carries conviction to every heart, and leaves no further possibility of doubt.

Here Mary is named alone, as <span class="accented">the</span> sister who was most deeply afflicted by the death of Lazarus, and most in need of friendly consolation (cf. also <a href="/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>). This clause may be read so as to include those who went to communicate the startling intelligence to the Pharisees among the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> of the Jews who went to comfort Mary and who "believed;" on the ground that <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, not (according to the text of D, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) with <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. This, however, would imply that all of them believed, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> went to the Pharisees with no hostile intent (Meyer); but why should not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> refer to the <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, implying another set not of the friends of Mary (Godet)? The remark would then be in harmony with the fact to which the evangelist continually calls attention, that Christ's miracles and words produced a twofold effect, and made a frequent division among the Jews, thus bringing to light who were and who were not his true disciples. The same facts excited faith in some and roused animosity in others. The great sign has been dividing men into hostile camps ever since. As Browning's Arab physician said- <p><span class="accented">"'Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.<br />This man (Lazarus) so cured regards the Curer then<br />As - God forgive me - who but God himself,<br />Creator and Sustainer of the world,<br />That came and dwelt in flesh on it awhile...<br />The very God!
