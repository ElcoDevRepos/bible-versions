The mention of Galilee is significant because Galilee was a region in northern Israel, often looked down upon by the Judean religious elite. It was considered less sophisticated and more rural. The Pharisees' question implies a dismissive attitude, suggesting that being from Galilee is a discredit. This reflects the cultural and social prejudices of the time, where regional biases were prevalent. Galilee was also the area where Jesus spent much of His ministry, and many of His disciples were from there, which further fueled the Pharisees' disdain.<p><b>&#8220;Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects a misunderstanding or deliberate oversight by the Pharisees. While they assert that no prophet arises from Galilee, this is not entirely accurate. The prophet Jonah was from Gath-hepher, a town in Galilee (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Additionally, <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> prophesies that a great light would come from Galilee, which Christians interpret as a reference to the Messiah. The Pharisees' claim also ignores the broader biblical narrative that God often chooses unlikely places and people to fulfill His purposes. This statement highlights their spiritual blindness and unwillingness to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, despite the evidence of His works and fulfillment of prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The verse warns us that a proud heart can twist even our Bible knowledge, whereas humble examination of the Word always points to Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Art thou also of Galilee?</span>--They seek to avoid his question, to which there could have been but one answer, by a counter-question expressing their surprise at the position he is taking: "Surely thou art not also of Galilee?" "Thou art not His countryman, as many of this multitude are?" They imply that Nicodemus could not have asked a question which claimed for Jesus the simple justice of the Law itself, without being, like Him, a Galilean.<p><span class= "bld">Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span>--The words mean, "Search the records, examine, scrutinize the authorities." (Comp. <a href="/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>.) They seek to pass from the matter of fact immediately before them to the question of authority. Their generalisation includes an historical error which cannot be explained away. Jonah is described in <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2Kings 14:25</a> as of Gathhepher, which was a town of Zebulun, in Lower Galilee. Possibly Elkosh, the birthplace of Nahum, was also in Galilee, and Hosea was certainly a prophet of the Northern Kingdom, though not necessarily of Galilee. Adverse criticism would lay this error also to the charge of the Evangelist. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/john/7-42.htm" title="Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?">John 7:42</a>, and <a href="/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>; <a href="/john/8-33.htm" title="They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?">John 8:33</a>.) But the obvious explanation is, that the Sanhedrin, in their zeal to press their foregone conclusion that Jesus is not a prophet, are not bound by strict accuracy; and it is not unlikely that, in the general contempt of Judaeans for Galilee, this assertion had become a by-word, especially with men with so little of the historical sense as the later Rabbis. As compared with Judaea, it was true that Galilee was not a country of prophets, and by-words of this kind often rest on imperfect generalisations. We have seen that of the great prophets of Christianity all were Galileans. Judas Iscariot alone, of the Twelve Apostles, was probably a Judaean (Note on <a href="/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered and said to him, Art thou also,</span> as he is and his supporters are, <span class="cmt_word">from Galilee?</span> and, therefore, is this criticism of yours on our baffled plan the dictate of provincial pride? They sought to fix a contemptuous country cousin sobriquet upon this distinguished man, instead of replying to his sensible inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">Search, and see, that out of Galilee</span> <span class="cmt_word">ariseth</span> <span class="cmt_word">no prophet.</span> The present tense has very nearly the force of the perfect, and denotes the general rule of the Divine providence in the matter. The prophetic order can scarcely be thought to have been recruited from the northern province. Even Hosea had his origin in Samaria. Amos was an inhabitant of Tekoah; twelve miles south of Jerusalem. Nahum the El-koshite cannot be proved to have sprung from the Galilaean town of Elkosh; though it is not impossible, it is at least probable, that Elkosh in Assyria, on the Tigris, two miles north of Mosul and south of Nineveh, was the place whence Nahum and his prophecies issued. Elijah the Tishbite, of the land of Gilead, cannot be claimed as a Gallilaean. The case is different with reference to Jonah of Gath-Hepher, of the tribe of Zebulon (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), who, as a solitary and by no means morally impressive character, might almost as an exception prove the truth of the general statement. The historical error is far from difficult to account for in the stress of the discontent which these Pharisees were now manifesting towards everything Galilaean. Godet, on the authority of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, being the text, would have it that "there has not now arisen in the Person of Jesus a Prophet." Baumlein presses this still further, by making the "prophet" mean "the Messiah." There is no reasonable ground for charging on these Pharisees "an incredible ignorance or incomprehensible misunderstanding." Such a charge is more like one of the incomprehensible misunderstandings of the modern critical school whenever a chance opens of assailing the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-52.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
