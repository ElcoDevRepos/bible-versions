Unlike the religious leaders of His time, who often sought personal recognition and honor, Jesus consistently pointed to the Father as the source of His authority and mission. This reflects the broader biblical theme of humility, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Christ's humility is highlighted. Jesus' statement also contrasts with the cultural norms of honor and shame in the ancient Near East, where personal glory was often pursued.<p><b>There is One who seeks it,</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to God the Father as the one who seeks His glory. This aligns with the biblical narrative that God desires to glorify His Son, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1</a>, where Jesus prays for the Father to glorify Him. The Father&#8217;s role in seeking the glory of the Son underscores the divine relationship and unity within the Trinity. It also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>, where God promises to uphold and glorify His chosen servant.<p><b>and He is the Judge.</b><br>This phrase identifies God as the ultimate judge, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. In the context of <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, Jesus is addressing the judgmental attitudes of the Pharisees, contrasting their flawed human judgment with the perfect and righteous judgment of God. This echoes passages like <a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>, which declares God as the judge who brings down one and exalts another. It also points to the eschatological role of Christ as judge, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>, where God has appointed a day to judge the world through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and the Jewish leaders, emphasizing His mission and relationship with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who often opposed Jesus and His teachings, questioning His authority and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "One who seeks it," indicating that God seeks the glory of His Son and is the ultimate judge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, where Jesus often taught and confronted religious leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, where Jesus was teaching in the temple courts during this significant Jewish festival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Jesus exemplifies humility by not seeking His own glory.

He immediately makes clear that personal fame is not His motive.<p>&#8226; Throughout His ministry He consistently pointed to the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>; <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<p>&#8226; His miracles, teachings, and even His coming crucifixion were all expressions of humble obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; By refusing self-promotion, He models the servant-hearted life He expects of His followers (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>).<p>This line also reminds us that true significance is never found in our own acclaim but in honoring God alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is One who seeks it</b><p>Though Jesus does not pursue His own glory, the Father does.<p>&#8226; At Jesus&#8217; baptism and transfiguration the Father publicly affirmed His Son (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; 17:5).<p>&#8226; The Father&#8217;s delight in exalting Christ continues: &#8220;Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in the face of rejection, Jesus rests in the certainty that the Father is actively working to reveal and vindicate the Son (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22-23</a>).<p>Believers can take heart: when we walk in obedience, God Himself watches over our reputations and causes His purposes to shine through us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He is the Judge</b><p>The same Father who glorifies the Son also judges all people.<p>&#8226; Judgment has been entrusted to Jesus (<a href="/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26-27</a>), yet originates from the Father, underscoring their perfect unity.<p>&#8226; Because God is Judge, human verdicts are temporary at best (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>). The religious leaders&#8217; opinions could not alter the Father&#8217;s righteous evaluation.<p>&#8226; This truth warns the hearer: rejecting the Son invites the Judge&#8217;s verdict (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18-19</a>).

They dishonoured Him. This to one who sought His own glory would have been matter of concern. For Him whose whole life was one of self-denial, their dishonour finds nothing which it can wound. His words repeat what He had taught them before. (See Notes on <a href="/john/5-41.htm" title="I receive not honor from men.">John 5:41</a>; <a href="/john/7-18.htm" title="He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.">John 7:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">There is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span>--Comp. <a href="/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>. The thought here is that though He Himself seeks not His own glory, the Father seeketh for the honour of the Son, and judgeth between Him and those who dishonour Him. The result of the judgment as to those who keep not His word is expressed in the next verse; and as to Himself in <a href="/john/16-10.htm" title="Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;">John 16:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, in honouring my Father, and in quietly bearing your unjustifiable reproaches, <span class="cmt_word">I am not seeking my glory</span> (cf. vers. 28, 42; <a href="/john/7-18.htm">John 7:18</a>). The claim of Christ to be and do so much is made because he has the happiness of the world, the salvation and life of men, and the glory of the Father as his consuming passion. He is not seeking his own glory; he is only crowning himself with the crown of utter self-abnegation. But, while he repudiates all care for his own glory, he knows that, <span class="cmt_word">there is One</span> to whom that glory is dear, <span class="cmt_word">who seeketh</span> his glory, and with whom it is perfectly safe, <span class="cmt_word">and who judgeth</span> with absolute impartiality and infinite knowledge.
