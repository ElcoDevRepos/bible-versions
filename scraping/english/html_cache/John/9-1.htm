Jesus is often depicted in the Gospels as moving from place to place, teaching and performing miracles. This itinerant ministry is significant as it fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who brings good news to the poor and freedom to the captives. The phrase also highlights Jesus' awareness and compassion, as He notices those in need even while on the move.<p><b>He saw a man</b><br>The act of seeing here is intentional and compassionate. In the cultural context of the time, many would overlook or ignore those with disabilities, often associating them with sin or divine punishment. Jesus' attention to the man signifies His mission to seek and save the lost, as stated in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>. This moment also prefigures the spiritual insight that Jesus offers, contrasting with the physical blindness of the man.<p><b>blind from birth</b><br>This detail emphasizes the severity of the man's condition, as congenital blindness was considered incurable. In the Jewish understanding, such a condition might be seen as a result of sin, either of the individual or their parents, as suggested by the disciples' question in <a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>. The healing that follows serves as a powerful sign of Jesus' divine authority and His role as the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), bringing both physical and spiritual sight.

It was then, as He was leaving the Temple to escape the fury of His enemies who had taken up stones to cast at Him, and was passing by. the place where the blind man was, that His eye fell upon him. The day was the Sabbath of the preceding discourse, now drawing to its close. (Comp. <a href="/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>; <a href="/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>, and <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.) The place was probably some spot near the Temple, perhaps one of its gates. We know that beggars were placed near these gates to ask alms (<a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>), and this man was well known as one who sat and begged (<a href="/john/9-8.htm" title="The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?">John 9:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">A man which was blind from his birth.</span>--The fact was well known, and was probably publicly proclaimed by the man himself or his parents (<a href="/john/9-20.htm" title="His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:">John 9:20</a>) as an aggravation of his misery, and as a plea for the alms of passers by. Of the six miracles connected with blindness which are recorded in the Gospels, this is the only case described as blindness from birth. In this lies its special characteristic, for "since the world began, was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind" (<a href="/john/9-32.htm" title="Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.">John 9:32</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> <span class="accented">The Lord confirms by a sign the declaration that he is the Light of the world</span>, <span class="accented">by giving eyesight as well as light</span>. That which had been proclaimed as a great truth of his Being and mission, viz. that he was the Light of the world, was now to be established and confirmed to the disciples by a signal miracle. The "higher criticism" finds explanation of this and other similar miracles at Bethsaida and Jericho, in the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-19.htm">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>. Volkmar holds that the story of Zacchaeus is thus rewritten! Thoma thinks that we have a spiritualization of the "miracle" on Saul of Tarsus.

He was obviously a well-known beggar, who had often proclaimed the fact that he was blind from birth (see ver. 8). Such a condition and history rendered the cure more difficult and hopeless in the view of ordinary <span class="accented">professors</span> of the healing art, and the juxtaposition of such a symbolic fact with the near activity of those who were boasting of their Abrahamic privilege and their national and mere hereditary advantages, is one of the instances of the unconscious poesy of the gospel history. There he sits, the very type of the race which says, "We <span class="accented">see</span>," but which to Christ's eye was proclaiming its utter helplessness and blindness, not asking even to be illumined, and revealing the fundamental injury done to the very race and nature of man, and calling for all the healing power that he had been sent into the world to dispense. The man who had been struck blind, or whose eyesight had been slowly dosed by disease, became the type of the effect of special sins upon the character and life; thus <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">vanity</span> conceals radical defects and weaknesses; <span class="accented">pride</span> hides from the sinner's own view his own trans<span class="accented">gressions</span>; temporary blindness to great faults is one of the symptoms of <span class="accented">gross sin</span> like David's, and prejudice is proverbially blind and deaf; but here is a man who is nothing less than the type of a congenital bias to evil, of hereditary damage done to human nature. Unless Christ can pour light upon those who are <span class="accented">born</span> blind, he is not the Savior the world needs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] was passing by,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(parag&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3855.htm">Strong's 3855: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass by, depart, pass away.
