The perfume in question is likely nard, a costly ointment imported from India, emphasizing its high value. Three hundred denarii was approximately a year's wages for a laborer, highlighting the extravagance of Mary's act. This reflects the tension between material value and spiritual devotion. Judas's question reveals a misunderstanding of Jesus's mission and the value of worship. The mention of "three hundred denarii" connects to the broader biblical theme of sacrificial giving, as seen in the widow's offering in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>.<p><b>and the money given to the poor?</b><br>The concern for the poor is a recurring theme in Scripture, with numerous Old Testament laws and New Testament teachings emphasizing care for the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). However, Judas's question is disingenuous, as noted in the following verses, where his true motives are revealed. This moment foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus, contrasting Judas's false piety with Mary's genuine devotion. The tension between earthly concerns and spiritual priorities is a central theme in Jesus's teachings, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where believers are encouraged to store up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve disciples, known for betraying Jesus.

David once said, &#8220;I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>).

St. Matthew says only "that it might have been sold for much." St. Mark, "that it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence," that is, in actual value, for the yearly wage of a working man, and for the food therefore which would have maintained a poor man's household for a whole year. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>.) St. Mark adds, "and they were angry at her." (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/11-33.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.">John 11:33</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</span> Sinful motive often hides itself under the mask of reverence for another virtue. In Mark's Gospel the same price was put upon the pound of pure nard as that which is mentioned here - about of our money. Christ had given emphatic advice about generosity to the poor, and even during this very week (<a href="/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>) it is clear that his words were not forgotten, and in his great discourse, probably also delivered during this same week, he identified himself with the poor (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, etc.), and called for unreserved consideration of them; so that this language was not unnatural. The value of this ointment is another minute indication that there is no connection between the Lazarus of John and the Lazarus of the parable. But John adds that the utter lack of perception on Judas's part of Mary's self-devotion was prompted by the most unworthy motive. The suggestion of Judas is put down by the evangelist to the sheerest covetousness. During the interval that elapsed, Judas had revealed his character, and John did not hesitate to refer the suggestion to the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor</span>. He really cared nothing for the poor. He was ambitious, eager for the display of the Master's power, anxious for the rewards which might follow the Master's assumption of supreme authority, turning to his own account all that might happen. <span class="cmt_word">But because he was a thief, and having</span> <span class="cmt_word">possession of the common purse</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in the sense of a chest (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), has a curious etymology, which had passed out of recognition; from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> comes <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, that in which month-pieces of flutes might be kept in safety, and subsequently a chest or box for the safe guardianship of other valuables), <span class="cmt_word">he was the bearer</span> - perhaps, <span class="accented">bore array</span> (see <a href="/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>, and Josephus, ' Ant.,' 7:15. 3, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>), at all events had at his disposal - <span class="cmt_word">of the things which were cast</span>, in generous profusion, into it. Thoma makes the astounding suggestion that "John" here covertly refers to Simon Magus of <a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18</a>, etc. The question is often asked - Why was Judas entrusted with the common purse? Was it not likely to aggravate a disposition to which he was prone? Did not Jesus know what was in man? and had he not discerned the propensity of Judas (see <a href="/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>)?
