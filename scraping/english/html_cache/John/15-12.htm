In the context of the Upper Room Discourse, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending departure. The use of "commandment" indicates a directive that is not optional but essential for His followers. This echoes the Old Testament where commandments were given by God to guide His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>. Jesus, as the fulfillment of the Law, provides a new commandment that encapsulates the essence of the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>that you love one another</b><br>The command to love one another is central to Christian ethics and community life. This love is not merely an emotion but an active choice to seek the welfare of others. In the Greco-Roman world, love was often understood in terms of familial or reciprocal relationships, but Jesus calls for a love that transcends these boundaries. This commandment is a reflection of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which calls for love of God, now extended to love for fellow believers. The early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, exemplified this love through communal living and mutual support.<p><b>as I have loved you</b><br>Jesus sets Himself as the standard for this love, which is sacrificial and unconditional. His love is demonstrated through His actions, teachings, and ultimately His sacrifice on the cross. This phrase points to the self-giving nature of Christ's love, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where Jesus humbles Himself and becomes obedient to death. The love of Christ is a fulfillment of the prophetic imagery of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who bears the sins of many. This love is also a type of the covenantal love God has for His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this commandment, Jesus is addressing His disciples during the Last Supper, imparting crucial teachings before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' commandment, representing all believers who are called to follow His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_supper.htm">The Last Supper</a></b><br>The setting of this discourse, a significant event where Jesus shares His final teachings and establishes the New Covenant through the breaking of bread and sharing of wine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_command_to_love.htm">The Command to Love</a></b><br>Jesus' command is not a suggestion but a directive that defines Christian living.

He is not offering a mere suggestion; He is issuing a directive that remains binding on every believer. In the immediate context (<a href="/john/15-10.htm">John 15:10</a>) He has just said, &#8220;If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love.&#8221; The connection is clear: obedience is the pathway to abiding fellowship. Elsewhere He reinforces the same truth: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The apostle John later echoes it: &#8220;And this is His command: to believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>). Because Scripture is accurate and trustworthy, we take these words literally&#8212;Christ has issued a standing order to His church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you love one another</b><p>The focus shifts from the command itself to its object: fellow believers. Christian love is never vague or theoretical; it is relational and practical.<p>&#8226; It manifests in warm affection: &#8220;Be devoted to one another in brotherly love&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It shows in humble service: &#8220;Serve one another in love&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; It becomes a living testimony: &#8220;By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p>&#8226; It fulfills the moral heart of God&#8217;s Law: &#8220;The entire Law is fulfilled in a single decree: &#8216;Love your neighbor as yourself&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-14.htm">Galatians 5:14</a>).<p>Such love is not sentimental; it is the everyday, observable choice to seek another&#8217;s highest good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as I have loved you</b><p>Jesus provides the pattern and the measure.
