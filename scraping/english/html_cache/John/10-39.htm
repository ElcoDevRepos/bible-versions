The context is the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, where Jesus was teaching in the temple courts. The leaders were increasingly hostile due to His claims of divinity, which they considered blasphemous. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who were threatened by His influence and teachings. The phrase "tried again" suggests previous attempts to arrest Him, highlighting their persistent opposition.<p><b>but He escaped their grasp</b><br>This demonstrates Jesus' divine ability to evade capture, emphasizing His control over the situation. Despite their efforts, the religious leaders could not apprehend Him until the appointed time of His crucifixion, fulfilling the divine timeline. This escape can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus' life and ministry were orchestrated according to God's sovereign plan. It also illustrates His wisdom and discernment in navigating dangerous situations, ensuring His mission continued until its completion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles, revealing His divine nature and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>In this context, they are the religious leaders and others who are opposing Jesus, often seeking to challenge or harm Him due to His claims of divinity and His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, a significant location for Jewish religious life and the setting for much of Jesus' ministry and eventual crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, much of the surrounding context occurs in or around the Temple, a central place of worship and teaching.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_escape.htm">The Escape</a></b><br>The event where Jesus evades capture, demonstrating His divine timing and control over the situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing.htm">Divine Timing</a></b><br>Jesus' escape illustrates that God's plans unfold according to His perfect timing.
