The city would have been bustling with pilgrims from all over the region, creating a vibrant and expectant atmosphere. The Passover Feast was a time of remembrance and celebration, and it was during this period that Jesus chose to reveal His divine authority through miraculous signs. This setting underscores the importance of Jesus' actions and teachings, as they were witnessed by a large and diverse audience.<p><b>many people saw the signs He was doing</b><br>The "signs" refer to the miracles Jesus performed, which served as evidence of His divine nature and messianic mission. In the Gospel of John, signs are not merely wonders but are meant to reveal deeper spiritual truths and point to Jesus as the Christ. The miracles performed by Jesus in Jerusalem would have included acts of healing and other supernatural events that demonstrated His power over creation. These signs were a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies that spoke of the Messiah performing miraculous deeds (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p><b>and believed in His name</b><br>To "believe in His name" implies more than intellectual assent; it suggests a trust and reliance on Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God. In the biblical context, a name represents the essence and authority of a person. Belief in Jesus' name indicates an acceptance of His identity and mission. This phrase highlights the initial faith response of many who witnessed His signs, though later passages in John reveal that not all belief was deep or enduring. This belief is a central theme in John's Gospel, emphasizing the necessity of faith for eternal life (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing signs that lead people to believe in His name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events take place, significant as the religious and cultural center of Jewish life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_feast.htm">Passover Feast</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, drawing many people to Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Those who witnessed Jesus' signs and believed in His name, representing a range of responses to His ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs.htm">Signs</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by Jesus, serving as evidence of His divine authority and identity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_signs.htm">The Importance of Signs</a></b><br>Jesus' signs were not just miracles but were meant to reveal His divine nature and mission.

It was the impulsive response of the moment, not based upon a previous preparation, nor resulting in a present deep conviction. It came far short of the faith of the disciples, who passed from a true knowledge of Moses and the Prophets to a true knowledge of Christ without a sign; but it came far above the disbelief of scribes and Pharisees, who after a sign rejected Him. It was not the prepared good ground bringing forth abundantly; but neither was it the hardened wayside which did not receive the seed at all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23-ch. 3:2.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Numerous signs in Jerusalem, with their twofold effects.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - A new paragraph is commenced here. The conversation with Nicodemus is prefaced by a very remarkable summary of facts, and a hint of principles of action, which are intended to throw light on the great discourse, which hears the same kind of relation to St. John's Gospel that the sermon on the mount does to St. Matthew's Gospel. It is a compendium of the Christian faith. The very fulness and sufficiency of it suggests the doubt of its authenticity. Is not the Lord's reticence on other occasions, and even his enigmatic, parabolic methods of teaching, in decided contrast with the abundance of the revelations with which Nicodemus was favoured? We are tempted to ask - What was the evangelist's source of information? The only reply that seems to me rational is that John himself was the auditor of this discourse, and has preserved it for the edification and solace of the world. The disciple whom Jesus loved never left him, but was perpetually drinking in his words, and, with a genuine Hebrew retentiveness, preserved them intact; at all events, he so reproduced the leading ideas of the conversation. This is, we maintain, a far more scientific treatment of the authorities than the hypothesis of a Johannist of the second century having gathered up and idealized the synoptic records of the scribes, who, by sundry questions, brought forth from the Lord some of his most characteristic teaching. Thoma urges that we have here a spiritual <span class="accented">rechauffe</span> of "the rich young man," of "the lawyer," and of the story of Paul, himself a Pharisee, when finally convinced that he needed a new creation and a spiritual life! First of all, then, we have the place, general period, and specific time referred to: <span class="cmt_word">Now when he was in Jerusalem</span> - not the temple, but in the houses and streets, and perhaps suburbs, of Jerusalem (<span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> the plural form used generally in the Gospel, while <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span> is used in the Revelation in symbolic sense) - <span class="cmt_word">at the Passover</span>; a period generally covering nine or ten days of celebration, extending from the first purifying of the houses from all leaven and the drawing of pure water on the thirteenth Nisan, the paschal meal on the fourteenth Nisan, the feasts in the evenings of the great days of convocation, fifteenth and twenty-first of the month, and the ceremonies of the intervening six days. <span class="cmt_word">In the feast</span> must refer to one or ether of the great days of convocation, worship, and feasting. <span class="cmt_word">Many believed on his Name;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on his Messiahship, rather than on himself, as their Prophet, Purifier, self-sacrificing Priest, or than on himself as Lamb of God or Son of God. They accepted on easy terms, with a fickle and perhaps eager fanaticism, the first impression produced by him <span class="cmt_word">when they saw the signs which he was making</span> of his heavenly mission and nature. We must conclude, therefore, that he did in many ways partially unveil himself. Nicodemus heard of these "signs," and referred them to a Divine commission. John does not here, nor elsewhere, say what these signs were - whether they consisted of effects produced on nature or on men, whether they were deeds of healing, or of moral compulsion, or repression, or reformation. Great expectations with reference to a coming Christ had been excited in the breasts of tens of thousands by John the Baptist's fiery ministry. The result was that men now flocked to Jesus in greater numbers than they had done to him (<a href="/john/3-26.htm">John 3:26</a>).
