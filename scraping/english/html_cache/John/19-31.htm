This preparation included cooking, cleaning, and other necessary activities. In the context of Passover, this day was particularly significant as it involved preparing for the Passover meal. The timing underscores the urgency and solemnity of the events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion, as the Jewish leaders were eager to ensure that all was in accordance with the Law before the Sabbath began.<p><b>and the next day was a High Sabbath</b><br>A "High Sabbath" refers to a Sabbath that coincides with a festival, making it more significant than a regular weekly Sabbath. In this case, it was the Sabbath during the Passover week, which was a major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. This highlights the importance of the events and the heightened religious observance during this period. The High Sabbath emphasizes the fulfillment of Old Testament typology, as Jesus, the Lamb of God, was crucified during Passover, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath</b><br>According to Jewish law, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, a body should not remain hanging overnight, especially not on the Sabbath, as it would defile the land. This law was taken seriously, and the Jewish leaders were concerned about maintaining ritual purity during the holy day. The removal of the bodies was a matter of religious duty and cultural practice, reflecting the Jewish leaders' adherence to the Law even amidst the crucifixion of Jesus.<p><b>the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed</b><br>Breaking the legs of those crucified was a method used to hasten death. Crucifixion victims relied on their legs to push up and breathe; breaking them would lead to asphyxiation. The request to Pilate indicates the Jewish leaders' desire to expedite the process due to the approaching Sabbath. This act also fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/34-20.htm">Psalm 34:20</a>, which states that none of the Messiah's bones would be broken, as Jesus' legs were not broken, distinguishing Him from the others crucified. This request and its outcome further illustrate the divine orchestration of events surrounding Jesus' death, aligning with scriptural prophecy and typology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish leaders and authorities who were concerned about the observance of the Sabbath laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who had the authority to grant the Jews' request regarding the crucified bodies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_preparation.htm">The Day of Preparation</a></b><br>The day before the Sabbath, when Jews prepared for the day of rest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_sabbath.htm">High Sabbath</a></b><br>A special Sabbath that coincided with a festival, in this case, the Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion_site.htm">Crucifixion Site</a></b><br>The place where Jesus and the two criminals were crucified, outside the city walls of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sabbath.htm">Understanding the Sabbath</a></b><br>The importance of the Sabbath in Jewish life and its implications for the events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy_fulfillment.htm">Prophecy Fulfillment</a></b><br>Recognize how the events of Jesus' crucifixion fulfill Old Testament prophecies, affirming the divine plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context.htm">Cultural Context</a></b><br>Appreciate the cultural and religious context of the Jewish leaders' actions, which were driven by adherence to the Law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_as_the_passover_lamb.htm">Jesus as the Passover Lamb</a></b><br>Reflect on the symbolism of Jesus as the Passover Lamb, whose bones were not broken, signifying His role in salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_body.htm">Respect for the Body</a></b><br>Consider the biblical principle of treating the body with respect, even in death, as seen in the request to remove the bodies.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_19_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 19:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_remove_bodies_before_Sabbath.htm">Why was it important to remove bodies before the Sabbath in John 19:31?

To the Jews this was defilement (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>), against which they were the more anxious to take precaution because the approaching Sabbath was "an high day."<p><span class= "bld">That their legs might be broken.</span>--The breaking of the legs by means of clubs was a Roman punishment, known by the name of <span class= "ital">crurifragium,</span> which sometimes accompanied crucifixion, and appears also to have been used as a separate punishment. It is not otherwise clear that its purpose was, or that its effect would be, to cause death, but this is the impression we derive from the present context (<a href="/john/19-33.htm" title="But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:">John 19:33</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-37.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">The piercing of the side, with its significance - the final close of the life of earth.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation; that is, the day before the sabbath</span> (<a href="/mark/15-42.htm">Mark 15:42</a>). This note of time certainly blends both the synoptists and John in the assurance that the crucifixion took place on a Friday. It was also, according to the previous statement, the preparation of the Passover, which, we have seen, is better understood in that literal sense than in the sense of "the Friday of Passover week." Consequently, there was a twofold sanctity about that particular sabbath, seeing that the sabbatic rest of the day following the Paschal meal coincided with the ordinary weekly sabbath; (<span class="cmt_word">for great, or high, was the day of that sabbath</span>) (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-16.htm">Exodus 12:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a>; and notes on John 13:1; 18:28; 19:14). It was a "great" and "high" day in a sense far more profoundly impressive than any that could be derived from the ceremonial enactments of the Hebrew code. The sabbath of his rest came at length. The toil, the agony, are over, the whole world is transformed during its hours into his resting-place. There has been no such sabbath since the creative Word rested from all his work. <span class="cmt_word">In order that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath.</span> This statement, with the events which followed, strongly confirms our interpretation of the day of the Crucifixion. The Jews would scarcely have justified a crucifixion on the first sabbatic day of the feast, if they shrank from the proceeding here described as in danger of taking place on the ordinary sabbath. They follow the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a>) so far as it would apply, and hasten the dissolution of the crucified, if it had not already occurred. (They) <span class="cmt_word">asked Pilate that their legs might be broken</span> (crushed) [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the same as aorist passive, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (Winer, Eng. trans., p. 85), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, first aorist passive], <span class="cmt_word">and that they might be taken away, as polluting corpses</span>. The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, equivalent to crurifragium, is a Roman custom, as it is clearly established by numerous authorities (Suet., 'Aug.,' 67; Seneca, ' De Ira.,' 3:32; see Wettstein); - a brutal custom, which added to the cruel shame and torment, even though it hastened the end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">It was</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7974;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
