They were known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and the oral traditions. This phrase indicates an internal discussion among the Pharisees, highlighting their concern and frustration. Historically, the Pharisees often found themselves in opposition to Jesus due to His teachings and actions, which challenged their interpretations and authority.<p><b>&#8220;You can see that this is doing you no good.</b><br>This statement reflects the Pharisees' realization that their efforts to discredit Jesus were failing. Despite their attempts to undermine His influence, Jesus continued to gain followers. This phrase underscores the growing popularity of Jesus and the inability of the Pharisees to control the situation. It also reveals their fear of losing power and influence over the people.<p><b>Look how the whole world has gone after Him!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "the whole world" is hyperbolic, emphasizing the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry. It suggests that people from various regions and backgrounds were drawn to Jesus, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being a light to the nations. This statement foreshadows the global spread of Christianity and the inclusion of Gentiles in the faith.
