Jesus' actions on the Sabbath, such as healing, challenged the Pharisaic interpretation of Sabbath laws, which had become burdensome with numerous restrictions. His works on the Sabbath highlighted His authority over the law and pointed to His identity as the Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>). This phrase underscores the tension between Jesus' ministry and the religious leaders' legalism.<p><b>the Jews began to persecute Him</b><br>The term "the Jews" often refers to the Jewish religious leaders, such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were influential in the Sanhedrin. Their persecution of Jesus was rooted in His perceived violation of the Sabbath and His claims of divine authority, which they saw as blasphemous (<a href="/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>). This opposition is a recurring theme in the Gospels, illustrating the growing conflict that would eventually lead to Jesus' crucifixion. The persecution also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the suffering Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), and it foreshadows the trials faced by early Christians as they spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performed miracles and taught about the Kingdom of God.
