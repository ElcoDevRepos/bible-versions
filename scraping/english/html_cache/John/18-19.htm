In the context of <a href="/john/18.htm">John 18</a>, while Peter is denying Jesus outside, Jesus is being interrogated inside. This highlights the contrast between Jesus' steadfastness and Peter's faltering.<p><b>the high priest</b><br>The high priest at this time was Caiaphas, though Annas, his father-in-law, also held significant influence. The high priest was the highest religious authority among the Jews, responsible for the temple and its rituals. This position was both religious and political, often appointed by Roman authorities, which sometimes led to corruption and political maneuvering.<p><b>questioned Jesus</b><br>The questioning was likely informal and preliminary, as Jewish law required trials to be held during the day and with witnesses. This interrogation was part of the illegal proceedings against Jesus, highlighting the miscarriage of justice He faced. It reflects the fulfillment of prophecies about the suffering Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the servant is oppressed and afflicted yet does not open His mouth.<p><b>about His disciples</b><br>The high priest's interest in Jesus' disciples suggests a concern about the potential spread of Jesus' influence and teachings. The disciples were seen as a threat to the established religious order. This questioning could also be an attempt to gather evidence against Jesus by associating Him with any perceived insurrectionist activities.<p><b>and His teaching</b><br>Jesus' teachings challenged the religious leaders' authority and interpretations of the Law. His emphasis on the spirit of the Law over the letter, and His claims of divinity, were seen as blasphemous and dangerous. This questioning reflects the leaders' inability to understand or accept Jesus' message, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people would hear but not understand.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being questioned by the high priest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>Likely Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time, who is questioning Jesus.

He asked, we may think, about the number of Christ's followers; the aim they had in view; the principles which He had taught them. The object of the questions was apparently to find some technical evidence in Christ's own words on which they may support the charges they are about to bring against Him in the legal trial before Caiaphas.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the following incident with the thirteenth and fourteenth verses. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>. Hengstenberg, Godet, and Westcott here say that the high priest is Caiaphas, present <span class="accented">i.e. at</span> the examination over which Annas presides as the older man; but Renan, Meyer, Lange, Steinmeyer ('Passion and Resurrection History'), and Moulton, with many others, say Annas was here the high priest in question. Tholuck dismisses the idea of Annas altogether, and, by inverting the place of Ver. 24 or treating the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> as pluperfect, suppose that Annas <span class="accented">had</span> sent the Lord to Caiaphas (so Calvin, De Wette, Hase, and others), who thus commenced his interrogatory. But the text of Ver. 24, now recovered, will not admit of this rendering. We find it far more satisfactory to accept this less formal examination, under the presidency of Annas, at which an attempt is made to put the Lord, if possible, to a test which will incriminate him. Keim says, "If Caiaphas were the acting high priest, and at the same time the soul of the movement against Jesus, it was for him and not for his father-in-law to take knowledge of the matter and report to the Sanhedrin." We must choose between two difficulties: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Caiaphas is first spoken of as "high priest," who, as we know from the synoptists, conducted the examination-in-chief, and then that Annas, as conducting a preliminary examination, is also styled "high priest" without any explanation; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> or we must admit the supposition that after Caiaphas had asked these incriminating questions, <span class="cmt_word">Annas</span> (who was not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), sent Jesus bound <span class="accented">to Caiaphas the high priest</span>. The former hypothesis is the easier. <span class="cmt_word">The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples</span>, the extent of his following, the number of his accomplices, the ramifications of the society or kingdom he professed to have founded, and <span class="cmt_word">concerning his doctrine,</span> the secret teachings that held his followers together. He evidently knows the claims of Jesus well enough; his spies and officers have continually been dogging the steps of Jesus, and hitherto he has failed to gain evidence positively incriminating him. And as his representatives a few days ago were utterly foiled, notwithstanding their clever design, he hopes by his own ingenuity to entrap the Lord in his talk. Our Lord, anxious not to endanger his disciples, points to the publicity of his ministry, and appeals to all and sundry who have heard him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
