It sets the stage for the burial process, which was a significant aspect of Jewish customs and fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus being buried.<p><b>Joseph of Arimathea</b><br>Joseph is identified as a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. Arimathea is believed to be a town in Judea, though its exact location is uncertain. Joseph's wealth and status are significant, as they fulfill the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a> that the Messiah would be with the rich in His death.<p><b>who was a disciple of Jesus</b><br>Joseph's discipleship is noteworthy because it highlights that followers of Jesus came from various social and economic backgrounds. His role as a disciple, despite his position, shows the diverse nature of Jesus' followers.<p><b>(but secretly for fear of the Jews)</b><br>This phrase indicates the tension and danger associated with being a follower of Jesus at the time. The Jewish leaders were hostile towards Jesus and His followers, which is why Joseph kept his discipleship secret. This fear reflects the broader context of persecution faced by early Christians.<p><b>asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus</b><br>Joseph's request to Pilate demonstrates his courage and commitment to Jesus, despite his previous secrecy. Roman law typically left crucified bodies to decay on the cross, but Joseph's request aligns with Jewish burial customs, which required prompt burial.<p><b>Pilate gave him permission</b><br>Pilate's granting of permission is significant, as it shows a level of respect or at least neutrality towards Jesus, despite the Jewish leaders' demands for His crucifixion. This act allowed for the fulfillment of Jewish burial customs and prophecies regarding Jesus' death.<p><b>so he came and removed His body</b><br>Joseph's actions fulfill the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a> and demonstrate his devotion. The removal of Jesus' body was an act of reverence and ensured that Jesus received a proper burial, which was crucial for the resurrection narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_of_arimathea.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a></b><br>A wealthy member of the Jewish council (Sanhedrin) who was a secret disciple of Jesus.

This "Joseph" is introduced with the article (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span>), and a second before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>, implying to the reader that he is now. by reason of thesynoptic narrative, a well-known person. This Arimathsea is probably the Ramathaim of <a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, the birthplace of Samuel, known now as the Nebi Samwil, about two leagues north-west of Jerusalem (Caspari, &sect; 49). Hengstenberg thinks the site is Ramleh, eight hours from Jerusalem. The maps of the Palest. Explor. Fund place it about a league to the east of Bethlehem. He was a "rich man" (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) - a fact which the First Gospel recalls without quoting the remarkable oracle of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, that Messiah, Servant of Jehovah, was with the "rich in his death." We may judge that Joseph had a residence in Jerusalem, even though he may still be known as belonging to and "from" Arimathaea, because he bad prepared, hard by the metropolis, a sepulcher which as yet had never been used. He was, moreover, a <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/luke/23-50.htm">Luke 23:50</a>; <a href="/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>), a member of the Sanhedrin, of high character, "good and just.... waiting for, expecting the kingdom of God' (say Mark and Luke), "and by no means consentient to the counsel and deed of his colleagues" (adds Luke). The whole position is briefly put by John: <span class="cmt_word">Being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), who had been concealed as such up to this crowning climax of his Lord's humiliation, not daring to confess Christ, <span class="cmt_word">by reason of his fear of the Jews</span>. Strange that he and Nicodemus should have cast away their fears at such a moment! <span class="cmt_word">Joseph asked of Pilate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); a word that implies something of claim and confidence on his part. The synoptists all three use <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which rather denotes the position of a suppliant for a favor. <span class="cmt_word">That he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.</span> This is supposed by some, who are anxious to make difficulties where none exist, that (according to <a href="/mark/15-43.htm">Mark 15:43</a>) Pilate had already given permission for the crurifragium, and yet was astonished that he was dead already. The statement of Mark is perfectly consistent with this and with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 31. Joseph, when all the transactions were over, sought for himself the privilege of a friend to take the body and bury it. Roman law permitted this privilege to friends; as Luthardt says, "The Christian martyrs of Rome were often buried in the catacombs." Not until death was obvious was it lawful to remove a body from the cross. The death had taken place; the Jews were prepared with Pilate's authorization to remove the corpse to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom. Joseph comes with a permission to take the corpse for honorable burial. <span class="cmt_word">He came therefore</span> - by reason of the permission - <span class="cmt_word">and took</span> <span class="cmt_word">the body</span> (of Jesus). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Afterward,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joseph</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#963;&#8052;&#966;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;s&#275;ph)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2501.htm">Strong's 2501: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph, a proper name.
