It is a solemn affirmation, indicating that what follows is of utmost significance. In the cultural context of the time, repeating a word was a way to underscore its importance. This phrase is unique to the Gospel of John and is used to introduce profound spiritual truths. It reflects Jesus' authority as the Son of God, who speaks with divine certainty.<p><b>he who believes</b><br>The concept of belief here is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and reliance on Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior. In the broader biblical context, belief is often linked with faith, which is a central theme throughout the New Testament. This belief is a personal commitment to Jesus, acknowledging Him as Lord and Savior. The historical context of this statement is during Jesus' discourse on being the Bread of Life, where He invites people to believe in Him for spiritual sustenance. This belief is also connected to the Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, who would bring salvation to God's people.<p><b>has eternal life</b><br>Eternal life is a key theme in the Gospel of John, representing not just an unending existence but a quality of life that begins now and continues forever in the presence of God. It is a present possession for the believer, not just a future hope. This life is characterized by a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Theologically, eternal life is contrasted with spiritual death, which is separation from God. The promise of eternal life fulfills Old Testament prophecies and is a central promise of the New Covenant. It is a gift from God, made possible through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus, who is the ultimate fulfillment of the types and shadows found in the Old Testament sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His followers and the crowd, emphasizing the importance of belief in Him for eternal life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present during this teaching, they are learning about the nature of faith and eternal life directly from Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A diverse group of people, including skeptics and seekers, who are listening to Jesus' teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered this discourse, a town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, significant in Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teaching, referring to the everlasting life that comes through faith in Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_jesus'_promise.htm">The Certainty of Jesus' Promise</a></b><br>Jesus begins with "Truly, truly," underscoring the reliability and importance of His statement.
