Jesus is speaking to His disciples and followers after performing the miracle of feeding the 5,000 and walking on water. The context is crucial as it follows a series of teachings where Jesus explains His identity as the Bread of Life. This setting is in Capernaum, a significant location for Jesus' ministry, where He often taught in the synagogue.<p><b>&#8220;This is why I told you</b><br>Jesus is referring back to previous teachings, emphasizing the importance of understanding His words. Earlier in the chapter, He had spoken about the necessity of divine intervention for belief. This statement serves as a reminder and clarification of His earlier teachings, reinforcing the idea that His words are not new but consistent with His message.<p><b>that no one can come to Me</b><br>This phrase underscores the exclusivity and divine nature of coming to Jesus. It highlights the concept of spiritual inability without divine assistance, a theme consistent throughout the Gospel of John. This aligns with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life, emphasizing that access to the Father is through Him alone.<p><b>unless the Father has granted it to him.&#8221;</b><br>This statement points to the sovereignty of God in the process of salvation. It reflects the doctrine of election, where God&#8217;s grace is necessary for someone to come to faith in Christ. This is consistent with <a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>, where Jesus states that no one can come to Him unless the Father draws them. It also connects to <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which speaks of faith as a gift from God, not a result of works.

When He speaks, He reveals the mind of God, for &#8220;the words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>).<p>&#8226; His words come amid the crowd&#8217;s grumbling over His claim to be the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-52.htm">John 6:52</a>). Like His earlier statements&#8212;&#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; 5:24)&#8212;this opening signals an authoritative, non-negotiable truth.<p>&#8226; Throughout the Gospel, every decisive moment begins with the Lord&#8217;s own voice: &#8220;I am the way and the truth and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and &#8220;I am the Light of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Here again, He centers the discussion on Himself as the sole source of salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is why I told you</b><p>&#8226; Jesus refers back to verse 44: &#8220;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him.&#8221; He repeats Himself for emphasis, underscoring a foundational principle.<p>&#8226; Scripture often reinforces vital truths by repetition&#8212;see <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21 and 17</a>:22, where Jesus twice foretells His death and resurrection.<p>&#8226; By reminding the listeners of what He has already said, Jesus invites them to connect the dots and grasp the larger narrative of God&#8217;s redemptive plan unfolding before their eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no one can come to Me</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights human inability. We are not merely reluctant; we are incapable of coming on our own. Paul echoes this: &#8220;There is no one who seeks God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-11.htm">Romans 3:11</a>) and &#8220;you were dead in your trespasses and sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus presents Himself as the only doorway to life (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). Yet without divine intervention, the door remains closed to us.<p>&#8226; This cuts against any notion that moral effort, religious heritage, or intellectual pursuit can bridge the gap. &#8220;Apart from Me you can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>unless the Father has granted it to him</b><p>&#8226; Salvation originates with the Father&#8217;s gracious initiative. &#8220;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The word granted underscores gift, not merit: &#8220;For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern runs through Acts: &#8220;All who were appointed for eternal life believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>). Divine granting precedes human believing.<p>&#8226; Yet the grant does not bypass the Son. The Father draws sinners specifically to Jesus, so that our faith rests in the crucified and risen Christ (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Assurance flows from this truth: the same Father who grants the coming also keeps the believer&#8212;&#8220;no one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-29.htm">John 10:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a> teaches that salvation is entirely God-initiated and Christ-centered. Left to ourselves, we cannot and will not seek Jesus. The Father lovingly overcomes that inability, granting the desire and capacity to come. Our rescue, from start to finish, is a gracious gift that magnifies the glory of God and secures unshakable confidence for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(65) <span class= "bld">No man can come unto me.</span>--Unless the fields had been prepared it was in vain to sow the seed. No effort on the sower's part could make them receptive. The fact that they believed not, declared that their hearts were not prepared, but did not affect the goodness of the seed.

Christ has come completely round to the fundamental principles with which he started. The coming to him, the believing on him, the spiritual apprehension of his Divine humanity, the adoring acceptance of his precious blood, the reception of the spiritual life-giving energy which went forth from him in word, depended on the Father's "drawing" - on those fundamental characteristics of appetite and capacity to receive the grace of Christ which are subjective and are referrible to the Father's good pleasure. <span class="accented">Christ</span> does not give the hunger, but the bread. From the beginning he saw the presence of the appetite after that which he came to bestow. Sometimes a morbid absence of all hunger, a moribund cessation of thirst, may be and is transformed into passionate and life-saving eagerness by The sight of food. The Father gives both the hunger and the food, the sense of need and the heavenly supply. The love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, is the drawing of the Father through the Son to himself. The drawing of the Father is the giving of souls to the Son. A fresh thought is here added. This drawing, thus interpreted, is God's gift also to the human soul The question arises - If the Lord knew, why did he choose the traitor, or call Judas into the innermost circle (see ver. 71)? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-65.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
