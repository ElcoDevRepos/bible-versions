The miracle took place near the Sea of Galilee, a region known for its Jewish population, who would have been familiar with the Old Testament prophecies and the significance of miraculous signs. In the Jewish tradition, signs were often seen as divine validation of a prophet's message or mission. The feeding of the multitude echoes the provision of manna in the wilderness during the time of Moses, suggesting a new era of divine provision through Jesus.<p><b>they began to say</b><br>The response of the people indicates a collective recognition and discussion among the crowd. This reaction shows the impact of Jesus' miracle on the masses, prompting them to verbalize their thoughts and expectations. It reflects the anticipation of the Jewish people for a deliverer, as they were under Roman occupation and longed for liberation and restoration.<p><b>&#8220;Truly this is the Prophet</b><br>The term "the Prophet" refers to the expectation of a prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of God raising up a prophet from among the Israelites. This expectation was deeply ingrained in Jewish eschatology, and the people saw Jesus' miraculous sign as a fulfillment of this prophecy. The use of "truly" underscores their conviction and certainty in this identification.<p><b>who is to come into the world.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the messianic expectation prevalent among the Jews of the time. The concept of "coming into the world" suggests a divine mission and purpose, aligning with the belief in a Messiah who would bring salvation and establish God's kingdom. This expectation is further connected to passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of a child born to bring peace and justice. The people's declaration reflects their hope that Jesus is the long-awaited deliverer who would transform their world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing a miraculous sign that leads the people to recognize Him as the Prophet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The crowd who witnessed the miracle and responded by acknowledging Jesus as the Prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sign.htm">The Sign</a></b><br>Refers to the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, which precedes this verse and serves as a catalyst for the people's declaration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet.htm">The Prophet</a></b><br>A reference to the expected prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, whom the Jews anticipated would come.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_jesus'_identity.htm">Recognition of Jesus' Identity</a></b><br>The people's declaration highlights the importance of recognizing Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

A &#8220;sign&#8221; in John is a miracle that points beyond itself to reveal who Jesus is (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; 3:2; 6:2). The crowd had eaten until they were full&#8212;something no mere man could arrange in the wilderness. Seeing that sign with their own eyes moved them from casual curiosity to serious reflection on Jesus&#8217; identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Jesus had performed</b><p>The text puts the spotlight squarely on Jesus. He, not His disciples, multiplied the loaves and fish (<a href="/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11</a>). Earlier He insisted, &#8220;The works the Father has given Me to complete&#8230; testify that the Father has sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>). The miracle authenticated His divine mission, just as later signs would culminate in the resurrection (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they began to say</b><p>A communal buzz rises: the miracle sparks conversation. Miracles never guarantee faith (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>), but they do force a verdict. Here the crowd voices what Andrew and Philip had hinted at earlier (<a href="/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41</a>,45). Their words show growing conviction, though a politicized agenda will soon emerge (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Truly this is the Prophet</b><p>Not merely &#8220;a&#8221; prophet, but &#8220;the&#8221; Prophet promised by God through Moses: &#8220;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>). Previous delegations had quizzed John the Baptist, &#8220;Are you the Prophet?&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>). Now, after witnessing the bread sign reminiscent of manna, the people connect the dots and ascribe that role to Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who is to come into the world</b><p>The phrase signals Messianic expectation echoed elsewhere: Martha&#8217;s confession, &#8220;I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>); the crowd&#8217;s shout on Palm Sunday, &#8220;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-26.htm">Psalm 118:26</a>). Their words acknowledge fulfillment of long-awaited promise&#8212;though many still envision a political liberator rather than the Savior who will give His flesh for the life of the world (<a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The feeding miracle opened the crowd&#8217;s eyes to Jesus&#8217; true identity. Witnessing the sign, they recognized that the long-prophesied, Moses-like Prophet had finally arrived on the world scene. While their understanding was still partial, their declaration points us to embrace Jesus as the divinely sent Redeemer whose works, words, and very presence fulfill Scripture with perfect accuracy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Miracle.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">sign.</span> (Comp. <a href="/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">That Jesus did.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that He did.</span> The example is instructive, as showing how words were added at the beginning of a portion read in church.

From <a href="/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21, 25</a>, we learn that the Sanhedrists distinguished between "the Christ," "the Elijah," and "that Prophet;" but these verses show how the two ideas were blended in the minds of the people. As Jesus fulfilled one or more of the predictions of the Old Testament, and embodied the foreshadowings of his entire career which were given in the temple and the sabbath, in the ritual and the priest, in the prophet and the king, it was gradually revealed to the world that in him all fulness dwelt. At all events, just as in the case of Nathanael, the prophetic gifts of Jesus suggested to the guileless man that he was King of Israel, so here we find a similar connection of ideas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
