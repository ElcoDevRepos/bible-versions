The term "grumbling" is reminiscent of the Israelites' complaints in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-27.htm">Numbers 14:27</a>), highlighting a recurring theme of disbelief and dissatisfaction among God's people. This context suggests a lack of faith and understanding of Jesus' mission. The use of "among yourselves" indicates internal discord, reflecting a community struggling with Jesus' teachings. This phrase calls for introspection and unity, urging the audience to cease their complaints and open their hearts to divine truth.<p><b>Jesus replied.</b><br>The phrase indicates a direct response from Jesus, emphasizing His role as a teacher and authority. In the Gospel of John, Jesus often engages directly with His audience, providing clarity and deeper insight into His teachings. This interaction underscores His patience and willingness to address doubts and questions. The use of "replied" suggests a conversational and relational approach, inviting the audience into a deeper understanding of His identity and purpose. Jesus' response is not just corrective but also instructive, guiding the listeners towards faith and acceptance of His message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the crowd, specifically the Jews who were questioning His teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

He had searched out a deeper reason for their murmuring than their probable involuntary ignorance of certain miraculous facts. <span class="cmt_word">No man can come</span> (is able to come) <span class="cmt_word">to me except the Father, who hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day</span>. In the previous utterance "all" which the Father "gives" to the Son "comes" to him, reaches him, enters into close relationship with him. Here "no one is able" by the nature of the case "to come" except this process and method of a Divine giving is realized. The Father's "giving" to him is described in new terms, as "the drawing" by the Father who hath sent him. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> almost always implies resistless or at least successful force, in the stretching of a sail, the dragging of a net, the force applied to a prisoner, the drawing of a sword (<a href="/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>; <a href="/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6, 11</a>; <a href="/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>). It is used also in Attic writers for the internal drawing of desire towards pleasure (Plato, "Phaedr.," p. 238, <span class="accented">a</span>; cf. Virgil, "Ecl.," 2:65, "<span class="accented">Trahit</span> sua quemque voluptas"). Our Lord also uses the word for his own attractive force, for the Divine magnetism of his cross, "If I be lifted up, I will <span class="accented">draw</span> all men to me;" I will counteract all the power of the prince of this world (see <a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>, note). This drawing of the Father to the Son by an internal operation on the heart must be interpreted by the attractive force of the love and sacrifice of the Father which is seen in Christ's being lifted up; and still further explained by his own subsequent assertion in ch. 14, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me." So that, while the whole action centres in Christ, the process begins and ends in the Father's heart. The Father loves the world; the Father would have all men come to him, have access to himself. To secure this Divine result he sends forth his Son with all the attractive force of love and death. This Divine humanity is a sufficient revelation of the perfect will and infinite love of God. The drawing of Christ to <span class="accented">himself</span> is nothing less than the drawing of the Father to <span class="accented">Himself</span>; for Christ came to do the will of him that sent him. Nor is this all, for all the "internal pressing" and revelation of need and peril, the conviction of sin and righteousness and judgment by the Comforter, is at once the Father's drawing and also the attraction of the Son, and the veritable "coming" of a soul through Christ to the Father. The Father "gives" to the Son by this double process: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he manifests his own fatherly heart in Christ; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> he opens men's eyes to see the Father in the Son. <span class="accented">No man can come to me except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him</span>: <span class="accented">and I will raise him up at the last day</span>. I, says Christ, "will complete and consummate his life at my great day of coronation and triumph." The several thoughts must be taken together, and they explain one another. The coming of men to the Father, access to God himself in the glory of the resurrection life, is the sublime consummation. Christ is sent, the Only Begotten is given, he is lifted up to draw men by the revelation of the Father's heart to himself, and thus in seeing and knowing that Christ is in the Father and the Father in him, the soul is drawn by the Father to the Son - is drawn by the Son to the Father. Yet the subjective work of the Father in the mind, moving it even to see the full meaning of the Christ and to yield to his attractive force, is strongly suggested. The direct contact of God himself with each soul that seeks, finds, and comes to him through Christ is made evident. There is, as Reuss says<span class="cmt_word">,</span> "la base mystique de la theologic Chretienne," rather than the announcement of a predestinating decree. Even Calvin says, "As to the kind of drawing, it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful influence of the Holy Spirit which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Stop</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
