The Gospels focus on key events and teachings, but Jesus' life was filled with countless acts of compassion, miracles, and teachings. This statement aligns with the understanding that the Gospels are selective narratives, each with a theological purpose. The phrase also highlights the divine nature of Jesus, whose works are too numerous to be fully documented, reflecting His boundless power and influence.<p><b>If all of them were written down,</b><br>The hypothetical scenario of documenting every act of Jesus underscores the limitations of human record-keeping compared to the infinite nature of His deeds. This reflects the ancient practice of oral tradition, where not all events were recorded in writing but were passed down through storytelling. It also suggests the importance of the Holy Spirit in guiding the Gospel writers to include what was necessary for faith and doctrine.<p><b>I suppose that not even the world itself would have space</b><br>This hyperbolic expression illustrates the magnitude of Jesus' impact. It suggests that the physical world cannot contain the full extent of His works, pointing to the spiritual and eternal significance of His ministry. This echoes the idea found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, where Christ is described as holding all things together, indicating His omnipresence and omnipotence.<p><b>for the books that would be written.</b><br>The imagery of an unending library of books serves to convey the inexhaustible nature of Jesus' life and mission. It implies that the written word is insufficient to capture the fullness of Christ, pointing believers to seek a personal relationship with Him through faith and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This also connects to the Johannine theme of Jesus as the Word (Logos), whose essence transcends written text, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose life, teachings, death, and resurrection are the foundation of Christian faith.

The transference from the plural to the singular--"We know" (<a href="/john/21-24.htm" title="This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.">John 21:24</a>), "I suppose" (in this verse)--has led to the supposition, which is in every way probable, that it is the individual testimony of an amanuensis who, from personal knowledge of the life of Christ, or from knowledge derived from the Apostle John or from others, feels that full beyond all human thought as this Gospel is, it is but a part of the greater fulness. No book could record, no words could tell, what that life was, or what things Jesus did. The disciples saw and believed, and wrote these things that we may believe, and in believing may have life in His name.<p>The word "Amen" is not found in the better MSS., and in no part of the written text. It is the natural prayer of some copyist, as it is the natural prayer of every devout reader that the writer's purpose may be fulfilled.<p>The chief MSS. have a subscription appended to the Gospel. "According to John" (Vatican); "Gospel according to John" (Sinaitic [?], Alexandrine, Paris, Basle); "Gospel according to John is ended;" "Gospel according to Luke begins" (Cambridge).<p><span class= "bld">#define description=DESC<p>#define abbreviation=ABBR<p>#define comments=CMTS<p>#define version=3<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written one by one</span> (or, each by itself), <span class="cmt_word">I suppose even the world itself would not contain the books which would</span> (then) <span class="cmt_word">be written</span>.

This is unsatisfactory. The writer, by the use of the name "Jesus," is not going back to the pre-existing, premundane activity of the Logos, but is simply conveying his enthusiastic sense of the inexhaustible fullness of the human life of the blessed Lord. The whole redeeming life, word, and work of the Word made flesh had a quality of infinity about it. The entire evangelic narrative has only touched the fringe of this vast manifestation, a few hours or days of the incomparable life. Every moment of it was infinitely rich in its Contents, in its suggestions, in its influence. Every act was a revelation of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Spirit, giving vistas into the eternities, and openings into the heart and bosom of Deity. Let all that thus was done take thought-shape in human minds, and word-shape in human speech, and book-shape or embodiment in human literature, and there are no conceivable limits to its extent. We use such expressions continually, without feeling that we are adopting any unnatural or unhealthy hyperbole. The infinite abundance of the teaching and significance of the blessed life of the Son of God is ample justification of the apostolic enthusiasm. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/21-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">There are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
