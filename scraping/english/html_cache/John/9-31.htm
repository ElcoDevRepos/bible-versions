In the Old Testament, passages such as <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a> and <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a> emphasize that sin creates a barrier between God and humanity. The context of <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a> is the healing of the man born blind, and this statement is made by the man himself, who is addressing the Pharisees. The Pharisees, known for their strict adherence to the law, would have understood this concept well. Theologically, this reflects the idea that sin separates humanity from God, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>but He does listen to the one who worships Him</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of worship and reverence towards God. Worship in the Jewish context involved not only ritual practices but also a heart posture of submission and obedience. The Psalms frequently emphasize that God is near to those who call on Him in truth (<a href="/psalms/145-18.htm">Psalm 145:18</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus teaches that true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23-24</a>). This phrase underscores the relational aspect of faith, where God responds to those who earnestly seek Him.<p><b>and does His will</b><br>Doing God's will is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments. In the context of <a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>, the healed man implies that Jesus, by performing the miracle, is doing the will of God. This aligns with Jesus' own statements about His mission, such as in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where He declares that He has come to do the will of the Father. The concept of doing God's will is also tied to obedience and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>, where Jesus states that only those who do the will of His Father will enter the kingdom of heaven. This phrase emphasizes the active response of faith, where belief is demonstrated through actions aligned with God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.

The argument of this and the two following verses may be stated in syllogistic form, thus:--(1) God heareth not sinners, but only those who worship Him and do His will. (2) That God heareth this Man is certain, for such a miracle could be performed only by divine power. (3) This Man, therefore, is not a sinner, but is from God.<p>He assumes as a general truth, which all accepted, that God heareth not sinners. This is based upon numerous passages in the Old Testament Scriptures--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm" title="If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:">Psalm 66:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-7.htm" title="When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.">Psalm 109:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-29.htm" title="The LORD is far from the wicked: but he hears the prayer of the righteous.">Proverbs 15:29</a>; <a href="/job/27-9.htm" title="Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?">Job 27:9</a>; <a href="/job/35-13.htm" title="Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.">Job 35:13</a>. We are, of course, to understand the word "sinner" in the sense in which they had used it in <a href="/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>. They had said that they knew this Man to be a sinner, and they meant one who was a sinner in a darker sense than that in which the word may be applied to all men. He asserts, as a truth which agrees with the whole teaching of the Old Testament, and with all the religious instincts of men, that there would be no communion between such a man and heaven. Such a one could not be commissioned as a prophet, or so heard in heaven as to have power to work miracles on earth. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/context/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41-42</a>, and <a href="/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>.) Men have sometimes taken the words altogether apart from their context, and read into them a dark meaning which they cannot be rightly made to bear. Neither these words, nor any words of God, assign any limit to the divine grace, which extendeth to every penitent sinner; nor is there any voice of any child of man lifted to heaven, which is not heard by the Father who is in heaven. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We know</span> - the new-born disputant takes up the language of these proud casuists, and adopts the technical phrase which they had used (vers. 24, 29) - we <span class="accented">know</span>, you and I, t<span class="cmt_word">hat God heareth not sinners</span> in any special sense of miraculous approval (<a href="/job/27-9.htm">Job 27:9</a>; <a href="/job/35-13.htm">Job 35:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>; and especially <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18, 19</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>). One aspect of Old Testament teaching shows that a man must delight himself in the Lord in order to receive the desires of his heart. If we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; but the prayer of the sinner, the desire of the wicked, is contrary to the will of' God. When the sinner turns from his sins to the Lord, the cry for mercy is in harmony with the will of God. In one sense every prayer is the prayer of sinful men; but it is the Divine life working within them that offers acceptable prayer. The prayer of the sinner as such is not heard. We know God does not listen to the cry of sinners, when, as sinners, they ask from the ground of their sin, to secure their own sinful purpose; <span class="cmt_word">but if any man be a worshipper of God</span> (the word <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), <span class="cmt_word">and doeth his</span> (God's) <span class="cmt_word">will, this man he heareth</span>. The blind beggar has learned the deepest truth of the Divine revelation about the conditions of acceptable prayer. The immediate application was the miraculous unwonted event as answer to the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man (see <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16-18</a>). So much for the general relation of this Healer to God. The rabbis were never tired of urging that the "answers to prayer depended on a man being devout and doing the will of God" (Edersheim, who quotes 'Ber.,' 6, b; 'Taanith,' 3:8; 'Succah,' 14, a; 'Yoma,' 28, a). So that the man was here fighting with drawn sword. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oidamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does not listen to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(akouei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
