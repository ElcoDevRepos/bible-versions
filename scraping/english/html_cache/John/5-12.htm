In the context of <a href="/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, Jesus had healed a man on the Sabbath, which was seen as a violation of Jewish law. The leaders were more focused on the perceived breach of the law than the miraculous healing. This question also foreshadows the growing tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities, which is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. The identity of Jesus is central to the Gospel, as it seeks to reveal Him as the Son of God.<p><b>who told you</b><br>The emphasis on "who told you" highlights the importance of authority in Jewish culture. The religious leaders were concerned with who had the authority to override traditional Sabbath laws. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels of Jesus' authority being questioned by the religious leaders. In Jewish tradition, rabbis and teachers held significant authority, and any deviation from established norms was scrutinized.<p><b>to pick it up and walk?</b><br>The act of carrying a mat on the Sabbath was considered work, which was prohibited by Jewish law. This reflects the strict interpretation of Sabbath laws by the Pharisees, who had developed an extensive list of activities forbidden on the Sabbath. The healing itself was not the issue; rather, it was the instruction to carry the mat that drew the leaders' ire. This incident highlights the conflict between Jesus' interpretation of the law, which emphasized mercy and compassion, and the Pharisees' legalistic approach. This theme is echoed in other Gospel accounts, such as <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12:1-14</a>, where Jesus challenges the Pharisees' understanding of the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus performs a miraculous healing at the Pool of Bethesda, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>- A man who had been an invalid for 38 years, healed by Jesus, and instructed to pick up his mat and walk, which he does, sparking controversy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>- Religious authorities who question the healed man about carrying his mat on the Sabbath, reflecting their strict adherence to the law and their opposition to Jesus' actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>- A place in Jerusalem known for its healing waters, where the invalid man had been waiting for healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>- The day of rest in Jewish tradition, which becomes a point of contention as the healing occurs on this day, challenging traditional interpretations of the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His authority over physical ailments and religious traditions, reminding us to recognize His lordship in all areas of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_over_legalism.htm">Compassion Over Legalism</a></b><br>The healing at Bethesda highlights the importance of compassion and mercy over rigid adherence to rules, encouraging believers to prioritize love and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The healed man's response to Jesus' command illustrates the importance of faith and obedience, even when it challenges societal norms or expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_rest.htm">Sabbath Rest</a></b><br>This passage invites reflection on the true purpose of the Sabbath as a time for restoration and connection with God, rather than mere rule-following.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_through_transformation.htm">Witnessing Through Transformation</a></b><br>The healed man's testimony serves as a witness to Jesus' power, encouraging believers to share their own accounts of transformation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_12_How_to_discern_authority.htm">How does John 5:12 challenge us to discern authority in our lives?

The Jewish leaders have just encountered a man who was crippled for thirty-eight years (<a href="/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>), now walking freely because Jesus spoke a word.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently points to Jesus as more than a teacher&#8212;He is the Son of God. <a href="/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17-18</a> shows that when He later claimed God as His Father, the leaders understood Him to be &#8220;making Himself equal with God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar identity questions appear in <a href="/john/9-17.htm">John 9:17</a> (&#8220;What do you say about Him?&#8221;) and <a href="/john/10-24.htm">John 10:24</a> (&#8220;If You are the Christ, tell us plainly&#8221;). Each time, the Gospel invites the reader to recognize Jesus&#8217; divine nature.<p>&#8226; By asking &#8220;Who is this man,&#8221; the leaders unwittingly set the stage for Jesus&#8217; later self-revelation in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-30</a>, where He details His unity with the Father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who told you</b><p>Authority is at stake. The leaders assume authority over Sabbath regulations (<a href="/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10</a>), yet someone has overridden their rule.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a> records Jesus declaring, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.&#8221; That authority is already on display here.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/john/7-46.htm">John 7:46</a> temple guards will admit, &#8220;Never has anyone spoken like this man!&#8221;&#8212;another testimony to the weight of Jesus&#8217; commands.<p>&#8226; Their question, therefore, exposes a clash: man-made religious authority versus the divine authority of the Messiah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To pick it up</b><p>&#8220;Pick it up&#8221; refers to the man&#8217;s mat&#8212;work the leaders judged unlawful on the Sabbath (<a href="/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-22</a> mentions carrying burdens as forbidden).<p>&#8226; Jesus had plainly instructed, &#8220;Get up, pick up your mat, and walk&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-8.htm">John 5:8</a>). His word reverses thirty-eight years of incapacity and supersedes legalistic boundaries.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/2-9.htm">Mark 2:9-12</a> records a similar scene where Jesus, after forgiving sins, tells a paralytic to pick up his mat; the action visible to all confirms His power to forgive and heal.<p>&#8226; The command to handle the mat demonstrates that when Jesus restores, He also equips&#8212;no lingering trace of the old bondage remains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And walk</b><p>Walking is both a physical reality and a spiritual sign.<p>&#8226; Immediately &#8220;the man was healed, and he picked up his mat and began to walk&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-9.htm">John 5:9</a>). The instantaneous nature of the cure underlines Jesus&#8217; creative power, reminiscent of <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> where God speaks and it happens.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a> foretold, &#8220;Then the lame will leap like a deer,&#8221; a messianic promise now fulfilled before their eyes.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a> shows the pattern continuing through the apostles: in Jesus&#8217; name the lame walk, underlining that the risen Christ still grants life and strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They asked</b><p>The questioners are the Jewish authorities, focused on rule-keeping more than rejoicing in a miracle.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/5-10.htm">John 5:10</a> reveals their priority: &#8220;It is the Sabbath; it is unlawful for you to carry your mat.&#8221; Their interrogation flows from tradition rather than compassion.<p>&#8226; A similar skeptical spirit surfaces in <a href="/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a> after another Sabbath healing: &#8220;This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/4-7.htm">Acts 4:7</a> shows the same leadership later demanding, &#8220;By what power or what name did you do this?&#8221; Opposition to Christ often masks itself as concern for order but is ultimately resistance to God&#8217;s work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/5-12.htm">John 5:12</a> captures a pivotal moment: religious leaders confront a once-crippled man, asking who dared override their Sabbath rules. Each phrase underscores key truths&#8212;Jesus&#8217; divine identity, His unrivaled authority, the completeness of His healing, and the predictably skeptical reaction of legalistic minds. The verse reminds believers that when Jesus speaks, His word breaks bondage, commands action, and reveals His glory, regardless of human opposition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">What man is that which said unto thee . . .?</span>--They pass over the giving of the power, and quote only the command which comes under their technical prohibition. The life and strength of once-palsied limb is as nothing; the fact that this man was breaking their tradition is secondary. The real motive is a charge against Him whose power the body of the Jewish people was feeling as a life-current, quickening deadened energies, and rousing men to a sense of God's presence in their midst. Aye, and these Jews of Judaism feel the thrill of this current all around them, though their will tries to isolate them by the coldness of unbelief from a power which they have not directed, and which they refuse to be directed by. Men and women who have been all their lives lying in moral helplessness, waiting and looking for God, yet never helped by God's priests and rulers, are now standing and moving in the strength that their new Teacher gives. They cannot deny it, but can they prevent it? This spirit is life, but there is still the letter which killeth. It cuts them to the heart to see His power in their midst, but there is the body of Rabbinic precept and oral law. He has now crossed that. They will apply it to stamp out His work and kill Him.<p><span class= "bld">Take up thy bed, and walk.</span>--Omit "thy bed," with the best MSS. It is inserted from the previous verse. Their passionate question expresses itself in the fewest words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - [<span class="cmt_word">Then</span>] <span class="cmt_word">they asked him, Who is the man</span> (contemptuous use of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as distinct from God's great messengers, or the legislators and prophets of the olden time, who have laid down the eternal Law of God) <span class="cmt_word">that said unto thee, Take up</span> [<span class="cmt_word">thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">bed</span>], <span class="cmt_word">and walk?</span> "The Jews" here ignore the work of healing and mercy, and seek to fasten a charge of overt criminality against some person unknown. A technical offence has been clone against the honour of their sacred place. The work of healing is an insignificant compensation for such a disgrace. They would be even with the heretical healer. Saving men by questionable methods is not to be endured. "Who is the man?" "Men and women lying in moral helplessness, not helped by God's priests and rulers, are now standing and moving in the strength their new Teacher has given. They cannot deny it; but can they prevent it? The rabbinic precept which he has crossed shall be applied to stamp out his work and kill him" (Watkins). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
