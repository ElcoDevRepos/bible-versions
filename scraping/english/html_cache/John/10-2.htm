In the context of ancient Near Eastern shepherding practices, the gate was the proper entrance to the sheepfold, distinguishing the true shepherd from thieves and robbers who would climb over the walls. This imagery is used to contrast Jesus with false leaders. The gate symbolizes the lawful and divinely appointed way, reflecting Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah entering through the proper channels (e.g., <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>).<p><b>is the shepherd of the sheep</b><br>The shepherd is a well-known biblical metaphor for leadership and care, seen in figures like David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>) and in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where God is depicted as the shepherd. In <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd, indicating His role as the true leader and caretaker of His people. This phrase underscores His authority and responsibility, contrasting with false shepherds who exploit the flock. The shepherd's role involves guidance, protection, and provision, reflecting Jesus' mission to lead His followers to spiritual safety and nourishment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

leaders and the true Savior. For instance, in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> Jesus warns, &#8220;Beware of false prophets&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; By using the singular &#8220;the one,&#8221; the verse points us to a specific, unique individual&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ alone&#8212;echoing <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>: &#8220;Salvation exists in no one else&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who enters</b><p>The true Shepherd takes action; He &#8220;enters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rather than sneaking over walls, He approaches openly and purposefully, underscoring His legitimacy.<p>&#8226; Jesus later applies this truth to Himself in <a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>: &#8220;I am the gate.

The appointment of a new body of disciples, whose very number is symbolical of a wider work, was the first step in the bringing in of the "other sheep." The Twelve answered to the number of the tribes of Israel; but the Seventy represent the nations of the world. The directions for this work to each body are nearly identical, but the restrictions laid upon the Twelve are not laid upon the Seventy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that enters in by the door is a shepherd of the sheep</span>. Let him be who he may, Pharisee or priest, prophet or king, pastor or evangelist, unless he approach the sheep by the right "way" he demeans and condemns himself. If he come by the door into the fold, he may be so far presumably a shepherd. One fold might contain several flocks, and a shepherd might lead these flocks into different enclosures according to his wisdom and care for his sheep. Neander, Godet, and Watkins think it possible that the whole imagery may have been borrowed from the eye. The shepherds towards evening were probably gathering their scattered flocks, according to Oriental custom, into their well-known enclosures, and Jesus with his audience might have seen them doing it if they gazed out from the courts of the temple over the neighboring hills (see also Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1:301, a passage which provides an admirable commentary on this parable). There is no absolute need that the customary and well-known habit of the country-side should have been visible at the moment. The abundantly attested practice furnished to his hearers all needful corroboration. The deeper significance of the passage lies in the prophetic symbolism of <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 31</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. Jehovah was the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), and he would appoint once more in their Messiah-King a David, who should be his gracious Representative and Agent. All these representations were gathered up in Christ's wonderful parable of the lost sheep (<a href="/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>). Thoma endeavors to credit the author of the Gospel with this ideal picture of the contrast between the true and false shepherd. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the [one who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
