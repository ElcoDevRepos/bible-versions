This event took place in Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, and news of it spread quickly. The crowd's eagerness to meet Jesus reflects the messianic expectations prevalent at the time, as many Jews were anticipating a political savior who would liberate them from Roman rule. The act of going out to meet Jesus also signifies a public acknowledgment of His growing influence and the hope that He might be the promised Messiah.<p><b>because they heard that He had performed this sign</b><br>The "sign" refers to the miraculous raising of Lazarus from the dead, which is one of the most significant miracles recorded in the Gospel of John. This miracle serves as a powerful testament to Jesus' divine authority and foreshadows His own resurrection. In the context of John's Gospel, signs are not merely miracles but are meant to reveal deeper spiritual truths about Jesus' identity as the Son of God. The crowd's reaction underscores the impact of Jesus' miracles on His public ministry and the way they validated His claims. This event also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah performing signs and wonders, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose miraculous sign (raising Lazarus from the dead) drew the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who went out to meet Jesus, motivated by the news of His miraculous sign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The man whom Jesus raised from the dead, which is the sign that prompted the crowd's interest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The place where Lazarus was raised from the dead, located near Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the events of <a href="/bsb/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, including the triumphal entry, take place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_testimony.htm">The Power of Testimony</a></b><br>The crowd's motivation to meet Jesus was based on the testimony of His miraculous sign.
