This moment occurs during the crucifixion of Jesus, highlighting the intimate relationship between Jesus and John. The presence of John at the crucifixion is significant, as most of the other disciples had fled. This demonstrates John's loyalty and courage, as well as his close relationship with Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;Here is your mother.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus addresses John, entrusting him with the care of His mother, Mary. This act is significant in several ways. Culturally, it was customary for the eldest son to ensure the care of his mother, especially if she was widowed. Jesus, in His final moments, fulfills this duty, showing His concern for Mary's well-being. Theologically, this moment can be seen as a symbolic act, where Mary represents the new family of believers, and John represents the Church. This act of entrustment also reflects Jesus' role as the compassionate Savior who cares for His followers.<p><b>So from that hour</b><br>The phrase "from that hour" indicates the immediacy and urgency of John's response to Jesus' command. It underscores the importance of obedience and the readiness to fulfill Jesus' wishes without delay. This moment marks a transition in the relationship between John and Mary, as they begin to live as family.<p><b>this disciple took her into his home.</b><br>John's action of taking Mary into his home signifies his acceptance of the responsibility given by Jesus. It reflects the early Christian practice of communal living and mutual support among believers. This act of hospitality and care is a practical demonstration of love and obedience to Jesus' command. It also highlights the importance of the Christian community in providing for one another's needs, as seen in the early Church in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is on the cross at this moment, demonstrating His care and provision even in His final hours.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beloved_disciple.htm">The Beloved Disciple</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be John, the author of the Gospel, who is entrusted with the care of Mary, Jesus' mother.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary,_the_mother_of_jesus.htm">Mary, the Mother of Jesus</a></b><br>Present at the crucifixion, she is given into the care of the beloved disciple, symbolizing the new family formed through faith in Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crucifixion.htm">The Crucifixion</a></b><br>The event where Jesus is crucified, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and demonstrating His sacrificial love for humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was crucified, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_compassion_and_provision.htm">Jesus' Compassion and Provision</a></b><br>Even in His suffering, Jesus ensures the well-being of His mother, teaching us the importance of caring for our family members.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_family.htm">Spiritual Family</a></b><br>Jesus' act of entrusting Mary to John symbolizes the creation of a new spiritual family among believers, transcending biological ties.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_responsibility.htm">Obedience and Responsibility</a></b><br>John's immediate acceptance of Jesus' request demonstrates obedience and the responsibility we have to care for one another in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>This moment fulfills Simeon's prophecy to Mary, reminding us of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/model_of_christian_love.htm">Model of Christian Love</a></b><br>Jesus' actions serve as a model for Christian love and service, prioritizing the needs of others even in times of personal trial.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_19_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 19:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_19_27_Jesus_family_care.htm">How does John 19:27 demonstrate Jesus' care for family responsibilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_s_obedience_show_here.htm">What does "from that hour" reveal about John's obedience to Jesus' command?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_Jesus_care_in_our_lives.htm">How can we emulate Jesus' example of caring for others in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Old_Testament_ties_to_John_19_27_actions.htm">What Old Testament principles align with Jesus' actions in John 19:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_19_27_Family_priority_in_faith.htm">How does John 19:27 challenge us to prioritize family in our faith walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_19_27_Jesus_bond_with_mother_disciples.htm">What does John 19:27 reveal about Jesus' relationship with His mother and His disciples?

He is therefore as a dead man, and yet he made the most royal gifts and precious assignments of that which was nevertheless inalienable. He gave a mother to his dearest friend. He gave a son most precious to the bereaved and desolate and broken heart of his widowed mother. Inconceivable that Weisse should call this "the basest self-adulation."

This may have been some temporary</span> lodging in Jerusalem, but it is more probable, as we have seen, that Salome and John had homes both in Jerusalem (see Introduction, p. 56.) and Capernaum. The mere phrase is used in <a href="/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a> in a more general sense of all the apostles. It is not necessary to believe that John at once removed the sacred deposit and bequest of his dying Lord to that home, though it is just possible. Bengel and many others think so, but it is not necessary to limit the meaning of "hour" to moment. The departure could hardly have taken place till all was over. In this brief reference a key is given to what John became to the Church. We must think of Salerno and John ever by the holy mother of the Lord, whether at Jerusalem, Capernaum, or Ephesus. The few words speak volumes, and his reticence here, as elsewhere, gives an unutterable grandeur to his words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(eita)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1534.htm">Strong's 1534: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of succession, then, moreover.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
