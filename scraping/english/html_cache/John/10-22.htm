It connects to the preceding events in the Gospel of John, where Jesus has been teaching and performing miracles. The timing is significant as it sets the stage for the events that follow, highlighting the ongoing tension between Jesus and the Jewish leaders.<p><b>the Feast of Dedication</b><br>Known today as Hanukkah, this feast commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 164 BC. It is not one of the feasts prescribed in the Torah but was established during the intertestamental period. The feast lasts eight days and involves the lighting of the menorah, symbolizing the miracle of the oil. This context is important as it reflects themes of light and dedication, which are significant in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>took place in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is the religious and cultural center of Judaism, home to the Temple, which is central to Jewish worship and identity. The city's significance is underscored by its frequent mention in the Gospels as the setting for key events in Jesus' ministry. The location emphasizes the importance of the events and teachings that occur there, as Jerusalem is the focal point of Jewish religious life.<p><b>It was winter</b><br>This detail provides a temporal context, as the Feast of Dedication occurs in the month of Kislev (November-December). The mention of winter may also symbolize the spiritual coldness and opposition Jesus faced from the religious leaders. Additionally, it sets the scene for the events that follow, as Jesus walks in Solomon's Colonnade, a sheltered area of the Temple, which would have been a practical place to gather during the colder months.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_dedication.htm">Feast of Dedication (Hanukkah)</a></b><br>This is a Jewish festival commemorating the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the Maccabean Revolt.

Wieseler has calculated that the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles was on October 19, and the Feast of the Dedication on December 20. (See <span class= "ital">Chron. Synops.,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 435; and comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>, and <span class= "ital">Chronological Harmony of the Gospels,</span> p. 35) In this interval we may with great probability place the events and teaching contained in <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a> to <a href="/luke/13-21.htm" title="It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.">Luke 13:21</a>, with the parallels in St. Matthew. (Comp.

The connection suggests several points of interest:--<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-42.</span> - 6. <span class="accented">The oneness of Christ with the Father</span>. <span class="accented">The discourse at the Feast of Dedication</span>, <span class="accented">with its results</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-26.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The Feast of Dedication</span>, <span class="accented">and the excitement of the people</span>. The paragraph is pregnant with meaning, arising from the place, the time, and the action of the Jews. It contains the discrimination between the Jews and those who were in spiritual union with himself, viz. his sheep. Then follow the characteristics and privileges of his sheep, which lead up to the climax in which he risks the deadly animosity of his hearers, by claiming identity of saving power with the Father. tic accounts for this by asserting what is expressive of positive consubstantiality with the Father. On any exegesis, this solemn announcement is a stupendous assumption of personal dignity, and was regarded by his hearers as blasphemous madness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>, <span class="cmt_word">the Feast of Dedication</span> (the <span class="accented">enkainia</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was</span> (celebrated) <span class="cmt_word">in Jerusalem</span>. This feast is not elsewhere noticed in the New Testament. The account of its origin is found in 1 Macc. 4:36, etc.; 2 Macc. 10:1 - 8; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:07. 7. <span class="cmt_word">And it was winter</span>. It was held on the 25th of Chisleu, which, in A.D. , would correspond with the 19th of December, in commemoration of the "renewal," reconsecration, of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus after the gross profanation of it by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc. 1:20-60 1 Macc. 4:36-57). It occupied eight days, was distinguished by illumination of the city and temple and of other places throughout the land, and hence was called the "Feast of Lights." Many interesting peculiarities of this feast are detailed in Edersheim's 'Life of Jesus,' 2:228, etc. One feature was the increase night by night of the number of lights which commemorated the restoration of the temple. All fasting and public mourning were prohibited (see 'Moed. K.,' 3:9). The high enthusiasm of the people made them long for deliverance from the Roman yoke. The Jews would probably have eagerly accepted Jesus as Messiah if he had been ready to take up the <span class="accented">role</span> of a political leader. Doubtless he was the Christ of the Hebrew prophecies, and in his own human consciousness his high position swelled his loftiest thought; but he was not the Christ of their Jewish expectation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At that time</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
