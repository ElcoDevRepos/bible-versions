The concept of eating His flesh is symbolic, representing a deep, personal acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice. In Jewish culture, eating flesh was a metaphor for internalizing teachings or ideas. This phrase also foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus institutes the practice of Communion, symbolizing His body given for humanity. The idea of consuming flesh would have been shocking to a Jewish audience, as it challenges traditional dietary laws and sacrificial practices.<p><b>and drinks My blood</b><br>Drinking blood was strictly forbidden in Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), making this statement even more provocative. Jesus uses this imagery to emphasize the necessity of accepting His sacrificial death for eternal life. The blood symbolizes the new covenant, as later established during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>). This phrase points to the sacrificial system's fulfillment in Christ, who offers His blood for the remission of sins, a concept deeply rooted in the Passover lamb's typology.<p><b>remains in Me</b><br>The concept of remaining or abiding in Christ is central to the believer's relationship with Him. It implies a continuous, living connection, akin to the vine and branches analogy found in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>. This abiding relationship is characterized by faith, obedience, and love, ensuring spiritual nourishment and growth. The idea of remaining also reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where faithfulness and commitment are paramount.<p><b>and I in him</b><br>This mutual indwelling signifies the intimate union between Christ and the believer. It reflects the promise of the Holy Spirit's indwelling presence (<a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>), enabling believers to live out their faith. This reciprocal relationship is foundational to the New Testament's teaching on the believer's identity in Christ, emphasizing transformation and sanctification.

The union which results from the communication of life is not temporary, but is one that remaineth. By virtue of it we abide in Christ, and He in us. It is our home life, that of every day, and will be the life of the eternal home (<a href="/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

The dwelling of the believer in Christ involves an utter self-surrender to him, a recognition of the supreme claims of the God-Man and his work, a complete trust in him as the Source of all life, a sound and abiding place of rest, a justification before God as one with Christ, as one identified with him in his well pleasing to the Father. The dwelling of Christ in the believer is the fulness and riches of the Divine life. Christ liveth in him (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>), thinks in his thoughts, moves through his will. This is sanctification. The believer is in Christ as the members are in the body. Christ is in the believer as God is in his temple. What is the condition of this mutual indwelling? Christ puts the condition of this Divine interpretation thus: "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him." The verb is in the present tense, implying the continuous appropriation of the Divine sustenance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-56.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
