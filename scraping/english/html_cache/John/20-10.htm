In the broader context of the New Testament, "disciples" often refers to the twelve apostles, but it can also include a larger group of followers. The focus on Peter and John highlights their leadership roles among the apostles, as seen in other passages such as <a href="/acts/3.htm">Acts 3:1-11</a> and <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.<p><b>returned</b><br>The act of returning signifies a transition from the extraordinary event of discovering the empty tomb back to their ordinary lives. This moment reflects a period of confusion and uncertainty for the disciples, as they had not yet fully understood the resurrection. The return also sets the stage for the subsequent appearances of Jesus, which would clarify and confirm the reality of His resurrection.<p><b>to their homes</b><br>The phrase "to their homes" indicates a return to a place of familiarity and safety. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, homes were central to family life and community. This return may symbolize a temporary retreat to process the events they had witnessed. It also contrasts with the later gathering of the disciples in the upper room, where they would receive the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). The mention of "homes" underscores the personal and communal impact of the resurrection, as the disciples would soon be called to spread the Gospel beyond their immediate surroundings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Specifically, Peter and John (the disciple whom Jesus loved) are the focus here.

Here, again, there is a vivid touch of individuality. John's own home contained the mother of the Lord. Around Peter were gathered the other apostles, and they were shortly to be joined by John himself. To them the more detailed report of the language of the angel would be repeated a hundred times. The "other Mary," Salome, Joanna, all press the wondrous assurance upon the eleven, as they mourned and wept, and for the most part were either bewildered or unbelieving. The two disciples start for Emmaus, and all that these knew as yet was that "certain women affirmed the tomb to be empty, that they had seen a vision of angels, which declared him to be alive," and "that certain of our company had visited the sepulcher, and found it even as the women 'had said, but him they saw not" (<a href="/luke/24-22.htm">Luke 24:22-24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
