In the cultural context of ancient Israel, shepherds had a close relationship with their sheep, who would only follow their own shepherd. This reflects the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers. The imagery of sheep and shepherd is prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God is depicted as the shepherd of His people. This phrase underscores the idea that true believers will not be led astray by false teachings or false prophets, as warned in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>.<p><b>in fact, they will flee from him</b><br>The act of fleeing indicates an instinctive reaction to danger or deception. In the historical context, sheep would naturally run from anyone who was not their shepherd, as they would perceive them as a threat. This reflects the spiritual instinct of believers to avoid false doctrines and teachings. The apostle Paul warns against false teachers in <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>, urging the church to be vigilant. This phrase also highlights the protective role of the Holy Spirit, who guides believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><b>because they do not recognize his voice.&#8221;</b><br>Recognition of the shepherd's voice is a key theme in understanding the relationship between Christ and His followers. In the biblical context, the voice represents authority and identity. Jesus, as the Good Shepherd, has a unique voice that His sheep know and trust. This is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>, where God is described as tending His flock like a shepherd. The inability to recognize the stranger's voice signifies the spiritual discernment given to believers, enabling them to distinguish between truth and falsehood. This discernment is further supported by the teachings in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which instructs believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Good Shepherd who knows His sheep and whose voice they recognize.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolic of believers who follow the voice of Jesus and not that of strangers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/stranger.htm">Stranger</a></b><br>Represents false teachers or influences that lead believers away from the truth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time, often seen as strangers leading people away from the true teachings of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of many of Jesus' teachings, including this discourse on the Good Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_the_shepherd's_voice.htm">Recognizing the Shepherd's Voice</a></b><br>Believers must cultivate a deep relationship with Jesus to discern His voice amidst the noise of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fleeing_from_false_teachings.htm">Fleeing from False Teachings</a></b><br>Just as sheep flee from strangers, Christians should actively avoid teachings and influences that contradict the truth of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>Spiritual discernment is crucial in identifying the voice of the Good Shepherd versus the voice of strangers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_guidance.htm">The Role of Scripture in Guidance</a></b><br>Regular engagement with the Bible helps believers recognize and follow the voice of Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>Being part of a faith community provides support and accountability in following the true Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_10_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 10:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_recognize_Jesus_voice_today.htm">How can we discern the voice of Jesus from "a stranger's voice" today?

The thought is of the flock following the shepherd to the pasture. On the road they would meet other persons whom they would not follow. Some would, as thieves and robbers, seek to lead them away, calling them by their names and imitating their shepherd's cry; but they have, by long usage, got to know his voice, and will not follow a stranger.<p><span class= "bld">But will flee from him.</span>--A strange word is a source of alarm to them. With the known tone of the shepherd's voice they have learnt to associate protection, guidance, food. His voice recalls these associations. A stranger's voice is something unknown, and therefore feared. It is as the voice of a plundering Arab who has called the flock before, or as the cry of a wild beast who has broken into the fold at night.
