In the context of <a href="/john/11.htm">John 11</a>, Caiaphas, the high priest, prophesies that Jesus would die for the Jewish people. Historically, the Jewish nation was central to God's redemptive plan, as seen in the covenants with Abraham, Moses, and David. The nation of Israel was chosen to be a light to the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>), and Jesus' mission was initially focused on the lost sheep of Israel (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>).<p><b>but also for the scattered children of God</b><br>This phrase expands the scope of Jesus' redemptive work beyond Israel to include Gentiles and Jews living outside of Israel. The "scattered children" can be understood as the Diaspora Jews, who lived outside of Palestine due to historical exiles, such as the Babylonian captivity. It also prophetically includes Gentiles who would come to faith in Christ, fulfilling the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). This aligns with the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>to gather them together into one</b><br>This phrase highlights the unifying purpose of Jesus' sacrifice. The gathering of God's children into one body is a central theme in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul, who speaks of the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-13</a>). This unity is both spiritual and eschatological, pointing to the ultimate gathering of believers at the end of the age (<a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>). Theologically, it reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the restoration and unity of God's people (<a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, whose mission is to bring salvation to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/caiaphas.htm">Caiaphas</a></b><br>The high priest who, unknowingly, prophesied about Jesus' death for the nation and the gathering of God's children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nation_of_israel.htm">The Nation of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish people, God's chosen nation, who were expecting a Messiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_god.htm">Children of God</a></b><br>Believers in Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who are united through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scattered_abroad.htm">Scattered Abroad</a></b><br>Refers to the dispersion of God's people, indicating the global reach of Jesus' redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' mission was to unite all believers, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries.
