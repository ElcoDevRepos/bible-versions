In the context of <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>, Jesus is addressing the crowd that followed Him after the feeding of the 5,000. They were seeking more physical bread, but Jesus redirects their focus to spiritual sustenance. This setting is significant as it follows a miraculous sign, emphasizing Jesus' authority and the importance of His teachings.<p><b>I am the bread of life</b><br>The "I am" statement is one of several in the Gospel of John, echoing God's self-identification to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM." This connection underscores Jesus' divinity. The metaphor of "bread" is deeply rooted in Jewish culture, symbolizing sustenance and life. In the wilderness, God provided manna to the Israelites, which is a type of Christ as the true spiritual sustenance. Jesus positions Himself as essential for spiritual life, surpassing the temporary satisfaction of physical bread.<p><b>Whoever comes to Me will never hunger</b><br>This invitation to "come" signifies an act of faith and trust in Jesus. The promise of never hungering is not about physical hunger but spiritual fulfillment. In the cultural context, bread was a staple of the diet, representing basic human need. Jesus offers Himself as the fulfillment of the deepest spiritual needs, echoing <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>, where God invites the thirsty and hungry to come and be satisfied.<p><b>and whoever believes in Me will never thirst</b><br>Belief in Jesus is equated with spiritual satisfaction. The imagery of thirst is reminiscent of Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, where He offers "living water." This promise of never thirsting again highlights the completeness and sufficiency of the salvation and life Jesus provides. It also connects to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-10.htm">Isaiah 49:10</a>, where God promises to guide and satisfy His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, declaring Himself as the "bread of life," which signifies His role as the spiritual sustenance for believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

Here they have asked for "this bread," the bread which giveth life, as distinct from that which perisheth. It is now present with them. He is that bread, whose characteristic is life. He is the Word of God, revealing God to man, teaching the eternal truths which are the life of the spirit just as bread is of the body.<p><span class= "bld">He that cometh to me . . . he that believeth on me.</span>--The natural bread satisfied no need unless it was appropriated and eaten. Prompted by hunger, they had taken into hand and mouth the loaves He had given them, and were filled. The same law holds for the spiritual bread. It is taken by him who comes to Christ; it is eaten by him who believes on Him, and it satisfies every need. It sustains the spiritual life in strength, and refreshes it in weariness. The bread of life giveth a principle of life, and he who hungereth and thirsteth for it shall also be filled, but with that which abideth, so that he shall never hunger and shall never thirst. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - [<span class="accented">But</span>, or <span class="accented">then</span>] <span class="cmt_word">Jesus said to them,</span> now dropping all disguise, and gathering up into one burning word all the previous teaching, which they might have fathomed, but did not. <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">am the Bread of life;</span> or "that which cometh down out of heaven, the veritable life-eternal-giving Bread, which I, as the steward of the Divine bounty, am giving, is my very self, my Divine humanity." On other occasions the Lord said, "I am the Light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), "I am the good Shepherd" (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>), "I am the Resurrection and the Life" (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>), "I am the veritable Vine" (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>). He claims here to be giving himself to the world, as the Source of its true life. The mode in which any human being can so assimilate this Bread that it should accomplish its purposes and transform itself into life, is by "coming" or "believing." The two terms are parallel, though in "craning" there is more emphasis laid on the distinct act of the will than in "believing." The process is very impressively conveyed. He who has started to come, <span class="cmt_word">he that is coming to me, shall by no means hunger; he that is believing on me -</span> endeavouring to effect such inward approval and surrender - <span class="cmt_word">shall never thirst</span> (the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> responds here to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). There is no special significance in the two-foldness of the parallel. "Coming" does not stand in any more immediate relation to "eating" than to "drinking," to the satisfaction of hunger than to that of thirst, nor does "believing" connote exclusively either the one or the other. The parallelism is a strengthening of the same idea. Approach to himself, believing surrender to the reality of his word, will satisfy the most pressing spiritual need, and do it in such a way that the hunger and thirst shall not, shall never, return. There is an invincible and unalterable assent produced by a real apprehension of Christ, which cannot be shaken out of the soul. Satisfaction of hunger may possibly (as Godet suggests) point to the supply of strength, and the appeasing of thirst to the supply of peace. The deeper idea is that the desire of the soul is satisfied, and it is not a recurrent desire. There are certain realities which, if once perceived, can never be unknown afterwards. There are consolations which, if once supplied, absolutely stanch and heal the wounds of the soul. Christ, in "coming down from heaven," by revealing the Divine Sonship in a Son of man. brings all heaven with him, opens all the Father's heart. To come to him and to believe on him is to feed on the corn of heaven and drink of that river of life, clear as crystal, which is ever issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
