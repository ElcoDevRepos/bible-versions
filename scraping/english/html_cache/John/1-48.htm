This question highlights the omniscience of Jesus, a key attribute of His divine nature. In the cultural context, knowing someone deeply was often associated with divine insight or prophetic ability. Nathanael's surprise indicates that he did not expect Jesus to have personal knowledge of him, suggesting that their encounter was divinely orchestrated.<p><b>Nathanael asked.</b><br>Nathanael, also known as Bartholomew in the synoptic Gospels, is introduced here as a sincere seeker of truth. His character is further revealed in the preceding verses where Jesus describes him as "an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit." This encounter takes place in the early stages of Jesus' ministry, as He begins to gather His disciples. Nathanael's presence and his questioning attitude reflect the Jewish expectation of the Messiah and the scrutiny with which they approached claims of messianic fulfillment.<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>Jesus' response to Nathanael is immediate and direct, showcasing His authority and the personal nature of His ministry. This interaction is a demonstration of Jesus' role as the revealer of truth, a theme that runs throughout the Gospel of John. His reply is not just an answer to Nathanael's question but also a revelation of His divine insight and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Before Philip called you,</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' foreknowledge and pre-existence, key themes in the Gospel of John. It suggests that Jesus' awareness of Nathanael predates their physical meeting, emphasizing His divine nature. The mention of Philip, who had just been called by Jesus, ties into the narrative of the calling of the first disciples, showing the interconnectedness of their experiences and the divine plan at work.<p><b>I saw you under the fig tree.&#8221;</b><br>The fig tree is a significant symbol in Jewish culture, often associated with peace, prosperity, and the study of the Torah. Sitting under a fig tree could imply a place of meditation or prayer, suggesting Nathanael's spiritual devotion. Jesus' knowledge of Nathanael's location and activity under the fig tree is a demonstration of His supernatural insight. This revelation is pivotal for Nathanael, leading to his confession of faith in Jesus as the Son of God and the King of Israel in the following verses. The fig tree also has eschatological connotations, often used in prophetic literature to symbolize Israel and its future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathanael.htm">Nathanael</a></b><br>A disciple of Jesus, also known as Bartholomew in the Synoptic Gospels.

The words rendered "under the fig-tree" include the going there and being there. It was <span class= "ital">the</span> fig-tree of his own garden (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1Kings 4:25</a>; Micah 4; <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm" title="In that day, said the LORD of hosts, shall you call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.">Zechariah 3:10</a>) where, and not at the corners of the streets, or to be seen of men, he was in the honesty of his heart praying to God. Unseen as he thought by any eye, he was seen by Him to whose coming every true Israelite looked, and the answer to the true thought and prayer was then as ever close at hand; but at hand, in the human form in which men find it so hard to read the Divine, and in the ordinary events in which men find it hard to realise God. A travelling Rabbi! He is the Messiah. From Nazareth the All Good cometh! This meeting, then, was not the first. There was an actual Messianic Presence in Nathanael's inmost thought. He is now startled, and asks, "Whence knowest Thou me?" We have never seen each other before. But in the deepest sense, the Messiah was there; "when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?</span> Without any title of respect, or admission as yet of any claims or right in him of whom Philip had spoken. There is, in this query, an abruptness of blunt sincerity which to some extent justifies the eulogium upon his innermost life. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee</span> - irrespective altogether of the excitement he has stirred within thee - <span class="cmt_word">when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee</span>. "The fig tree" was the type of the Israelite home (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>). There, not in the corners of the street, was he accustomed to meditate and pray. The <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> clause is in apposition with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, and (though another translation is grammatical) suggests that Christ saw him under conditions which had nothing whatever to do with those under which Philip called him. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> is used for the most part of simple <span class="accented">sight</span>, and need not necessarily connote miraculous penetration and recognition of all that was passing in his mind. And yet the obvious intention of the evangelist is to convey more than casual observation. As Weiss says, "What is mentioned is not one isolated glance into the depths of the soul, but past events, along with their outward circumstances, are known to Jesus." "I saw thee" - I have not been ignorant of thee; I watched and thought of thee. The astonishing effect produced by this saying of the Lord has been variously conceived. Some have surmised preternatural optical powers exercised from a distance; others a simple observation without comment at the time when our Lord watched him in one of the places of retirement sacred to solemn meditations and instructions. It seems to me that the occasion to which our Lord referred must have been one of extreme spiritual interest and memorableness to Nathanael; some hour had passed of commanding influence upon his mind - one of those periods of visitation from the living God, when lives are recommenced, when an old world passes away and a new one has been made, of which the lips have never spoken, and which are among the deepest secrets of the soul. It was the conviction that his secret meditation had been surprised, that the unknown Stranger had fathomed the depth of his consciousness, which wrought and wrung the great confession of which we have here a crisp outline. <span class="accented">I saw thee</span>; and by this implication I can sympathize in all thy longings, [It is interesting to remember that Rabbi Akiba is described as studying the Law under a fig tree; and Augustine heard the voice which ruled his subsequent life "under a fig tree" ('Conf.,' 8:12, 28); and Buddha's most wonderful convictions and resolves occurred under the bo tree.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/1-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;How</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Pothen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4159.htm">Strong's 4159: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of posis with enclitic adverb of origin; from which or what place, state, source or cause.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do You know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#953;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gin&#333;skeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(me)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
