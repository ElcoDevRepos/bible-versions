The author, traditionally identified as the Apostle John, selected specific signs and teachings of Jesus to convey a theological message. This phrase indicates intentionality in the writing, suggesting that the events and teachings included serve a specific purpose. The Gospel is not merely a historical record but a theological document aimed at fostering faith.<p><b>so that you may believe</b><br>The purpose of John's Gospel is evangelistic and apologetic. The aim is to lead readers to faith in Jesus. This reflects the broader mission of the early church, which sought to spread the message of Jesus as the Messiah. The use of "believe" is central to John's theology, emphasizing trust and reliance on Jesus for salvation.<p><b>that Jesus is the Christ</b><br>"Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." This title connects Jesus to Old Testament prophecies about a coming savior and king. Passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> are often seen as prophetic foreshadowings of Jesus' life and mission. The claim that Jesus is the Christ asserts His fulfillment of these messianic expectations.<p><b>the Son of God</b><br>This title emphasizes the divine nature of Jesus, a core tenet of Christian doctrine. It distinguishes Jesus from other messianic figures by asserting His unique relationship with God the Father. This claim was controversial in the Jewish context, where monotheism was strictly upheld. The title "Son of God" is also linked to passages like <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, which speaks of the king as God's son.<p><b>and that by believing</b><br>Faith is presented as the means by which individuals can access the benefits of Jesus' work. This reflects the broader New Testament teaching that salvation is by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Belief is not merely intellectual assent but involves trust and commitment to Jesus as Lord and Savior.<p><b>you may have life</b><br>"Life" in John's Gospel often refers to eternal life, a quality of life that begins now and continues into eternity. This life is characterized by a relationship with God through Jesus. <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a> speaks of Jesus coming to give life abundantly, indicating both a present and future reality.<p><b>in His name</b><br>The name of Jesus represents His character and authority. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it conveyed the essence of a person. To have life in Jesus' name means to experience the salvation and blessings that come through His person and work. <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> underscores this by stating that salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of John, presented as the Messiah and Son of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Gospel, who provides a firsthand account of Jesus' life and ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who witnessed His resurrection and were tasked with spreading His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where many of the events of Jesus' final days, including His resurrection, took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The pivotal event that confirms Jesus' divinity and the truth of His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_gospel.htm">The Purpose of the Gospel</a></b><br>John's Gospel is written with the express purpose of leading readers to faith in Jesus as the Christ and Son of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_belief.htm">The Power of Belief</a></b><br>Belief in Jesus is not just intellectual assent but a transformative trust that results in eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_jesus.htm">The Centrality of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus is the focal point of Christian faith; understanding His identity is crucial for salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_eternal_life.htm">The Assurance of Eternal Life</a></b><br>Belief in Jesus provides assurance of eternal life, a promise that offers hope and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture.htm">The Role of Scripture</a></b><br>The written Word is a tool for revealing Jesus' identity and mission, guiding believers to faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_20_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 20:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_20_31_Why_believe_Jesus_as_Messiah.htm">How does John 20:31 encourage belief in Jesus as the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_life_in_His_name_daily.htm">What does "life in His name" mean for daily Christian living?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_20_31_3_16_on_eternal_life.htm">How does John 20:31 connect with John 3:16 about eternal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Strengthen_faith_in_Jesus_via_prayer_study.htm">How can you strengthen your belief in Jesus through prayer and study?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_20_31_inspire_evangelism.htm">How does John 20:31 inspire sharing the Gospel with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Purpose_of_John_20_31_in_the_Gospel.htm">What does John 20:31 reveal about the purpose of the Gospel of John?

His object is that those for whom he writes may become believers, and read in these signs the spiritual truths which lay behind them. He has traced step by step the developments of faith in the Apostles themselves, and this has reached its highest stage in the confession of Thomas. He has recorded the blessedness of those who shall believe without sight, uttered in his Master's words. In the confession of Thomas, and in the comment of our Lord, the object of the author finds its full expression, and with their words the Gospel finds its fitting close. "Become not faithless, but believing;" "My Lord and my God;" "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed"--these are the words the author heard and records. "But these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God." This is the object he had in recording them.

The author did not intend to write a full history or a detailed biography; he avowed having made a unique and well-considered selection of "signs," which formed the theme of great discourse, of "words" which revealed the inner depths of that wondrous nature, and which, far from exhausting the theme, only touched its fringes; and he did this with a distinct aim, <span class="cmt_word">in order that ye</span> (he here addresses the Churches already founded and waiting for his legacy) <span class="cmt_word">might believe</span>.

The prologue here finds its true and efficient complement. The purpose now betrayed expounds the structure of the Gospel as a whole. The apostle claims kinship with the central apostolate. The Hebrew prophet does not disdain his true kindred. The evangelist does not disclaim his predecessors.
