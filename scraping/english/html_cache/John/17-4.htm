Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently pointed to God, attributing His teachings and miracles to the Father. This glorification is seen in His obedience, teachings, and miracles, which all reflect God's glory. The concept of glorifying God is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's glory is often associated with His presence and power (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>). Jesus' life on earth was a fulfillment of the prophecies concerning the Messiah, who would reveal God's glory to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>by accomplishing the work</b><br>Jesus refers to the specific mission and tasks given to Him by the Father. This includes His teachings, miracles, and ultimately His sacrificial death and resurrection. The "work" is a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speak of the suffering servant. Jesus' work also includes establishing the foundation for the Church and the spread of the Gospel. His use of the word "accomplishing" indicates completion and fulfillment, echoing the creation narrative where God saw His work as "very good" (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).<p><b>You gave Me to do</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine commissioning of Jesus by the Father. It underscores the unity and purpose within the Trinity, where the Son willingly submits to the Father's will. This divine mission is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus often speaks of being sent by the Father (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36</a>, <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>). The work given to Jesus was not only to teach and heal but ultimately to provide salvation through His death and resurrection. This mission reflects the covenantal promises made to Abraham, where through his seed all nations would be blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), and is a testament to God's redemptive plan for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing God the Father in prayer.

This is, however, included in the next clause. The night has come when the earthly ministry is at an end. The Jesus Christ, whom the Father has sent, has completed his task. The whole work of the earthly manifestation of the Word was at an. end. Suffering remains, the issues of the conflict with evil have to be encountered; but the die is cast - the thing is done. The godly life, as well as the atoning death, are correlative parts of the merits and work of Christ, and have glorified the Father. But what a self-consciousness beams forth in these simple words! St. Paul, on the verge of his martyrdom, in the midst of the horrors of the Neronian persecution, exclaimed, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course." But our Lord is unconscious of any coming short of the glory of God; and he even counts on higher power to glorify God by returning to a position which he had for a while vacated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/17-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#974;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
