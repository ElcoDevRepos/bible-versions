The name "Judas" was common in the first century, derived from the Hebrew name Judah, meaning "praise." "Iscariot" likely indicates his place of origin, possibly Kerioth, a town in Judea, distinguishing him from other Judases in the New Testament. The mention of his father, Simon, further identifies him, emphasizing his human lineage and grounding his historical existence. Judas's role as a disciple highlights the paradox of being close to Jesus yet choosing betrayal, reflecting the theme of free will and the mystery of iniquity.<p><b>For although Judas was one of the Twelve,</b><br>Judas's inclusion among the Twelve Apostles underscores the gravity of his betrayal. The Twelve were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and witnesses to His ministry, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and the foundation of the new covenant community. Judas's position as one of the Twelve signifies trust and responsibility, making his eventual betrayal more poignant. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the human capacity for sin, even among those who are part of the inner circle of faith. It highlights the theme of apostasy and the warning that proximity to holiness does not guarantee personal righteousness.<p><b>he was later to betray Jesus.</b><br>The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is a pivotal event in the Passion narrative, leading to Jesus's arrest and crucifixion. This act of betrayal was prophesied in the Old Testament, with passages such as <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a> often cited as foreshadowing Judas's actions. The betrayal is a fulfillment of divine prophecy, yet it does not absolve Judas of personal responsibility. It serves as a profound example of the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will. Judas's betrayal is also a type of the ultimate rejection of Christ, symbolizing the rejection of God's offer of salvation. This act is a catalyst for the events leading to the crucifixion, which is central to the Christian understanding of redemption and atonement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver.
