Scripture presents him not as an outsider but as one of the Twelve whom Jesus personally chose (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier signs of inner compromise appear in <a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-6</a>, where Judas objects to Mary&#8217;s act of worship and is identified as a thief. Those earlier choices set the stage for the final act of betrayal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a> reminds us that Judas&#8217;s role &#8220;was foretold in Scripture.&#8221; His appearance here underscores God&#8217;s sovereign foresight while holding Judas fully responsible for his actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His betrayer</b><p>&#8226; The phrase is blunt: Judas is defined by the deed he is about to complete. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> had foretold, &#8220;Even my close friend &#8230; has lifted up his heel against me,&#8221; a prophecy Jesus applied to Judas in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>.<p>&#8226; Betrayal from within intensifies the pain&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> notes, &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend,&#8221; implying that the opposite, a friend&#8217;s treachery, is devastating.<p>&#8226; Yet even this treachery serves God&#8217;s redemptive plan: Jesus will walk willingly into arrest, trial, and crucifixion (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also knew the place</b><p>&#8226; Judas&#8217;s knowledge is not accidental; it comes from shared experience. Earlier evenings spent with Jesus give him precise familiarity with Gethsemane&#8217;s quiet grove (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a> links the place to &#8220;the Kidron Valley,&#8221; the route David fled when betrayed by Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23-31</a>). The echo highlights a recurring biblical theme: betrayal by someone close.<p>&#8226; Jesus does not hide; He returns to the very spot His betrayer expects. <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a> pictures the Good Shepherd laying down His life with deliberate intent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because Jesus had often met there</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a> records, &#8220;Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives.&#8221; The garden was a consistent gathering spot, not a last-minute hiding place.<p>&#8226; This pattern displays Jesus&#8217;s transparency. He keeps His regular routine, surrendering to the Father&#8217;s timing rather than seeking escape (<a href="/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>).<p>&#8226; It also illustrates Christ&#8217;s empathy.

Judas, once a trusted companion, arrives armed with insider knowledge. Yet Jesus walks knowingly into that place, faithful to His customary rhythm and surrounded by disciples He loves.

(Comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 371.) All the Evangelists narrate the coming of Judas. John only remembers that the spot was one belonging, it may be, to a friend or disciple, where Jesus was in the habit of going with His disciples, and that Judas therefore knew the place, and knew that he would probably find them there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Judas also, who was betraying him</span> (notice present tense in contrast with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">knew the place: because oftentimes Jesus resorted</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was assembled there</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thither with his disciples</span>. Luke tells us that during this very week (<a href="/luke/21-37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>) they had passed their nights (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) on the "Mount of Olives," and it is most likely that Judas conjectured that they had gone thither again to pass the night. The fact here mentioned by John, that Judas knew the place, disposes of the ignorant and vulgar taunt of Celsus, that our Lord sought to escape from his enemies after having challenged them (see Orig., 'Contra Cel.,' 2:9. 10). Keim, with perversity, declares that John only represented the place as known to Judas, in order to enhance the voluntary nature of the sacrifice. Some explanation may thus be given of the fact that the eleven disciples, having reached an accustomed place of repose, all slumbered and slept, and were not able to watch one hour. The choice of this particular garden for the purpose cannot be unraveled. Dean Plumptre <span class="accented">suggests</span> that it was the property of Lazarus, who was no other than the rich young man, who sold his all and gave to the poor, all but one solitary garment, and that he himself was keeping this one <span class="accented">possession</span> for the <span class="accented">uses</span> of his Lord on that very night, and that when in danger of arrest he it was that fled away naked. This is pure conjecture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Judas,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#959;&#973;&#948;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ioudas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2455.htm">Strong's 2455: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Judas, the name of ten Israelites; also of the posterity of one of them and its region.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
