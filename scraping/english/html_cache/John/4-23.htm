Jesus speaks of a transition from the old covenant, centered on physical locations and rituals, to the new covenant, which emphasizes spiritual worship. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which foretold a new covenant where God's law would be written on hearts rather than stone.<p><b>when the true worshipers</b><br>The term "true worshipers" distinguishes those who genuinely seek God from those who merely follow religious rituals. This echoes the call for sincerity in worship found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him.<p><b>will worship the Father</b><br>The focus on "the Father" highlights the personal and relational nature of worship in the new covenant. This relationship is made possible through Jesus Christ, who reveals the Father (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>) and provides access to Him (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). It underscores the shift from a distant, ritualistic worship to an intimate, familial relationship with God.<p><b>in spirit and in truth</b><br>Worship "in spirit" refers to the inner, heartfelt devotion that transcends physical locations and rituals. It aligns with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who enables believers to connect with God on a spiritual level (<a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-16</a>). "In truth" emphasizes worship that is grounded in the reality of who God is, as revealed in Scripture and through Jesus Christ, who is the truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This dual emphasis ensures that worship is both sincere and doctrinally sound.<p><b>for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him</b><br>This phrase reveals God's active desire for genuine worshipers. It reflects His initiative in salvation, as He draws people to Himself (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>). The idea of God seeking worshipers underscores His love and grace, as He desires a relationship with humanity. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God calling a people for Himself, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well, revealing profound truths about worship and the nature of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A woman from Samaria who encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.

God now gathers people who, by the Spirit and anchored in Scripture&#8217;s truth, adore Him genuinely. He Himself seeks such worshipers, inviting all who believe in Christ to draw near and glorify Him with authenticity and fidelity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">But the hour cometh.</span>--Better, as in <a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>, <span class= "ital">but there cometh an hour.</span> He adds to this thought, what He could not add to the previous one, "and now is." Local worship was not yet giving way to spiritual; but a band of true worshippers was being gathered, and some were then following Him.<p><span class= "bld">The true worshippers.</span>--Her distinction of place was of the accident, but the essence was the nature of the worship. What could any worship be to a God who saw the impurity of the heart, and the contradiction of thought and word? What could <span class= "ital">she</span> know of the worship of which she speaks? Yes; and the temple at Jerusalem was a house of merchandise, instead of one of prayer; what did priest and Levite, scribe and Pharisee, know of true worship?<p><span class= "bld">In spirit and in truth.</span>--The link between human nature and the divine is in the human spirit, which is the shrine of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm" title="What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?">1Corinthians 6:19</a>). All true approach to God must therefore be in spirit. (Comp. <a href="/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>.) Place, and time, and words, and postures, and sounds, and all things from without, are important only in so far as they aid in abstraction from the sensible world, and in elevation of the spirit within. The moment they distract they hinder true worship. Ritual cannot be discussed without risk of spiritual loss. The words "in truth," already expressed in <span class= "ital">true</span> worshippers, and repeated in the following verse, are more than "truly." Sincerity is not a test of acceptable worship, though it is a requisite. Bigots sincerely think they do God's service. Worship which is "in truth" is in harmony with the nature of the God whom we worship. To think of God in hearing His truth, to kindle the soul by hymns of praise, to realise the earlier portions of collects and prayers which utter His attributes, are necessary to the truth of the petitions, and thanksgivings, and adorations of worship. The model prayer of Christianity brings home to the heart the Fatherhood of God in its first words.<p><span class= "bld">For the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">for such the Father also seeketh His worshippers to be.</span> The word "such," <span class= "ital">i.e., of this character,</span> is emphatic. The "also" expresses that the worship, on the part of the true worshippers, is in accordance with the divine will: "the Father also (on His part) . . ." The reader will not fail to note the emphasis in this reply on the word "Father" (<a href="/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a> and twice in this verse). This name of God, which we teach children to lisp in earliest years, came to her, it may be, now for the first time. He is not Vengeance to be appeased, nor Power to be dreaded, but Love to be received. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>.) It is when men learn to think of God as Father that merely local and material worship must cease. The universal desire and practice of worship is the witness to a universal object of worship. The yearning of the human spirit is that of a child seeking the author of his being. The seeking is not human only. The Father also seeketh His child, and seeth him when he is a great way off (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm" title="And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.">Luke 15:20</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the hour cometh, and now is</span> - already the day has dawned, the new conception is breaking like "awful rose of dawn" upon the minds of some - <span class="cmt_word">when the</span> <span class="cmt_word">veritable</span> <span class="cmt_word">worshippers</span> - those who answer to the idea of worshippers, those who actually draw near to the Father in living fellowship and affectionate appreciation of his eternal Name - <span class="cmt_word">shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.</span> An old misreading of this text, accepted by some Fathers, and based upon the idea expressed in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>, has found expression in the Sinaitic Codex, "in the spirit of the truth." But "spirit" here does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the spirit of man - that part of man's constitution through which he most especially bears the image of God, and with which the Divine Spirit deals, and in which he dwells (<a href="/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>). The worship in spirit is worship contrasted with all mere carnal concomitants, all mere shadows of the good things to come, all mere ritual, all specialties of place, or time, or sacrament, or order. It need not be in despite of a genuine reverence for days, or seasons, or postures, or washings, but in absolute independence of them, and they, without this, will be actually valueless. <span class="accented">And in truth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as dealing with reality, the adequate and veracious expression of genuine desires and veritable emotions; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">nam et</span> (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">For indeed also the Father seeketh such to be his worshippers.</span> Luthardt and Meyer differ as to the emphasis. Meyer insists that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span> lays stress on the word which immediately follows, and he refers to <a href="/1_corinthians/14-8.htm">1 Corinthians 14:8</a> as not contradicting the rule. He would render, "For the Father also on his part seeketh," etc. Luthardt says that the new thought is to be found in <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, and therefore upon this the emphasis is laid. Westcott, by many passages, such as <a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, etc., urges that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> "alleges a reason which is assumed to be conclusive from the nature of the case." The whole sentence is therefore covered by the expression, "For the Father also on his part seeketh those as worshippers of him who worship him in spirit and in truth." A slight contrast is felt between the regimen of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with accusative, here again introduced, following upon that with dative in the first clause. Moulton would render the first clause, "offer worship to the Father," and the second by "worship him." The Father is now seeking, by the ministry of his Son, by the gift of his Spirit, for those who approach him with deeply felt need and true affection, in spirit, not in ceremony, in truth, not in hypocritical or heartless profession. This is another indication of the high truth taught in the prologue (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>; <a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>, see notes) that there are vast differences among men, even anterior to their reception of the perfect revelation of the Father's heart in Christ Jesus. "The life is the light of men." There are those who "do the truth" and are "of the truth," who "worship God in spirit and in truth." The whole gospel dispensation is a search for these. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
