The invalid, a man who had been suffering for 38 years, recognizes Jesus as someone of importance, though he may not fully understand who Jesus is. This encounter takes place at the Pool of Bethesda, a site known for its healing properties, located near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem. The use of "Sir" reflects the cultural norms of showing respect to those perceived as having authority or ability to help.<p><b>&#8220;I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.</b><br>The belief was that an angel would stir the waters of the pool, and the first person to enter afterward would be healed. This reflects a common ancient belief in the healing properties of certain waters, which is also seen in other cultures. The invalid's statement highlights his isolation and lack of community support, a significant issue in a society where family and community were crucial for survival and well-being. This phrase underscores the man's desperation and hopelessness, as he has no one to assist him in reaching the pool.<p><b>While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the competitive nature of the situation at the pool, where many sick and disabled people gathered, each hoping to be the first to enter the water. The invalid's condition prevents him from moving quickly, emphasizing his helplessness and the futility of his efforts. This scenario can be seen as a metaphor for the limitations of human effort and the need for divine intervention. The man's plight is a poignant reminder of the broader human condition, where many are in need of healing and salvation, yet unable to achieve it on their own. This sets the stage for Jesus' miraculous intervention, demonstrating His power and compassion, and foreshadowing the spiritual healing and salvation He offers to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invalid_man.htm">The Invalid Man</a></b><br>A man who had been disabled for thirty-eight years, lying by the Pool of Bethesda, hoping for healing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the Gospel, who approaches the invalid man and offers healing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem believed to have healing properties when its waters were stirred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stirring_of_the_water.htm">The Stirring of the Water</a></b><br>A phenomenon believed to be caused by an angel, leading to healing for the first person to enter the pool afterward.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_festival.htm">The Jewish Festival</a></b><br>An unspecified feast of the Jews, during which Jesus visits Jerusalem and encounters the invalid man.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god,_not_circumstances.htm">Dependence on God, Not Circumstances</a></b><br>The invalid man's focus was on the pool, but Jesus redirected his attention to Himself as the true source of healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_word.htm">The Power of Jesus' Word</a></b><br>Jesus' command to "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk" demonstrates His authority over physical ailments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The man's response to Jesus' command required faith, illustrating that belief often precedes the manifestation of God's power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_marginalized.htm">Compassion for the Marginalized</a></b><br>Jesus' interaction with the invalid man shows His concern for those society overlooks or neglects.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_community.htm">The Role of Community</a></b><br>The man's lament about having no one to help him highlights the importance of community support and care for one another.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_5_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 5:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_5_7_man_s_trust_in_humans_not_God.htm">How does John 5:7 illustrate the man's reliance on human help over divine?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/John_5_7_man_s_view_of_Jesus_power.htm">What does John 5:7 reveal about the man's understanding of Jesus' power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_5_7_inspire_seeking_Jesus.htm">How can John 5:7 encourage us to seek Jesus first in difficulties?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/John_5_7_vs_Prov_3_5-6_Trust_God_or_man.htm">Compare John 5:7 with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God over man.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_John_5_7_lesson_daily.htm">How can we apply the lesson of John 5:7 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/John_5_7_s_role_in_Jesus_healings.htm">What is the significance of John 5:7 in the context of Jesus' healing miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_5_7_s_link_to_faith_and_healing.htm">How does John 5:7 reflect the theme of faith and healing in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Bethesda_in_John_5_7.htm">Why is the pool of Bethesda important in understanding John 5:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/key_themes_in_john.htm">What are key themes in the Book of John?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/should_you_separate_yourself_from_them.htm">What miracles did Jesus perform according to the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_3,000_baptisms_at_once.htm">Is there historical or archaeological support for 3,000 people being baptized at once (Acts 2:41)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_god_answer_every_prayer.htm">Does God answer all prayers?

Will this Stranger, whom he has never seen before, do for him what none of those who often saw him had ever done? Will he watch for the bubbling water, and place him first in it? Is there one being in all the world who regards his state as calling for loving pity, rather than scornful loathing?<p><span class= "bld">I have no man.</span>--There is an eloquence of helplessness more powerful than that of words. Day by day he has watched, listened for the first sound, caught the first movement in the bath, summoned the feeble vestiges of strength to an action on which all depended, and hoping each succeeding time, in spite of despair in which last time's hope has been engulfed, has been coming, when "another goeth down before." "I have no man" is to-day the helpless, unspoken cry of thousands imaged here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sick</span> (impotent) <span class="cmt_word">man answered him:</span> <span class="cmt_word">Sir,</span> <span class="cmt_word">I have no man, when the water has been troubled, to put me</span> <span class="cmt_word">into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me</span>. This implies that some special advantage accompanied the troubling of the water. The sudden escape of the medicinal gas may have soon subsided, and, with it, the special virtue of the well. The difficulty which the sick man found in reaching the point of disturbance may be accounted for in many ways. The steps which led into the water; the weakness of the sufferer, which made it an impossible task without help; the eagerness at many other impotent folk to take advantage of the supposed cure, jostling one another with selfish haste; or the absence of any personal friend to fight his battle for him, and cast him (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span>) with the required plunge into water. The last point may be explained on the supposition that he was a comparative stranger in Jerusalem, and had made no friends; or by another, which several other allusions justify, viz. that he was a man who, from some reason or other, could neither make nor retain friendship. The melancholy recital of his frequent disappointment is given with an air of mendicant resignation - a kind of morbid satisfaction with his lot. The phrase, "while I am coming, another," etc., implies that he could move, if slowly, without help. The moroseness of self-dependence characterizes some sufferers, who rather glory in isolation than lament it.
