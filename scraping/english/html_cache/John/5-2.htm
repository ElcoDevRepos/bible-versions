Jerusalem&#8212;the city where God chose to place His name (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>)&#8212;is repeatedly the backdrop for decisive works of the Lord. From Jesus&#8217; dedication as an infant in the temple (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-38</a>) to His triumphal entry (<a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10-11</a>), Jerusalem is where prophecy meets fulfillment. By locating the event here, John reminds us that the God of Scripture works in real places and real history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>near the Sheep Gate</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> identifies the Sheep Gate as the portal priests rebuilt for bringing sacrificial animals into the temple precincts.<p>&#8226; This detail is no throwaway line; it places the pool at a gate associated with sacrifice, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11-12</a> contrasts daily temple sacrifices with Christ&#8217;s once-for-all offering, reinforcing the symbolism of Jesus performing a healing ministry right beside the very gate that ushered in animals destined for the altar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a pool</b><p>Water in Scripture frequently pictures cleansing and life. Think of Naaman washing and being healed in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>) or the blind man sent to wash in Siloam (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>). This pool, then, is more than a geographical marker; it becomes a stage for illustrating the living water Jesus later offers in <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>. The setting prepares our hearts for both physical and spiritual renewal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with five covered colonnades</b><p>Eye-level architectural precision lends eyewitness credibility (cf. <a href="/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>).

For "sheep-market," we should read with the margin, <span class= "ital">sheep-gate</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm" title="Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/3-32.htm" title="And between the going up of the corner to the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.">Nehemiah 3:32</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>). This gate was known well enough to fix the locality of the pool, but is itself now unknown. St. Stephen's Gate, which has been the traditional identification, did not exist until the time of Agrippa. There is something tempting in the interpretation of the Vulgate adopted by some modern travellers and commentators, which supplies the substantive from the immediate context, and reads "sheep-pool." But the fact that the Greek adjective for "sheep," is used here only in the New Testament, and in the Old Testament only in the passages of Nehemiah referred to above, seems to fix the meaning beyond doubt.<p><span class= "bld">Bethesda</span> means "house of mercy." The "Hebrew tongue" is the then current Hebrew, what we ordinarily call Aramaic, or Syro-Chaldaic. The spot is pointed out traditionally as <span class= "ital">Birket Israil,</span> near the fort of Antonia, but since Dr. Robinson's rejection of this, it has been generally abandoned. He himself adopted the "Fountain of the Virgin," which is intermittent. He saw the water rise to the height of a foot in five minutes, and was told that this occurs sometimes two or three times a day. The fountain is connected with the pool of Siloam, and probably with the fountain under the Grand Mosque. The seventh edition of Alford's <span class= "ital">Commentary</span> contains, an interesting letter, pointing out that Siloam itself was probably the pool of Bethesda, and that the remains of four columns in the east wall of the pool, with four others in the centre, show that there was a structure half covering it, which resting upon four columns would give five spaces or porches. The fact that this pool is called Siloam in <a href="/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a> does not oppose this view. The word "called" here, is more exactly <span class= "ital">surnamed,</span> and "House of Mercy" may well have been given to the structure, and thus extended to the pool in addition to its own name. But to pass from the uncertain, it is established beyond doubt, (1) that there are, and then were, on the east of Jerusalem mineral springs; (2) that these are, and then were, intermittent; and (3) that such springs are resorted to in the East just as they are in Europe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there is in Jerusalem.</span> A phrase denoting intimate acquaintance with the topography of the city, and the present tense suggests either a hint of a ruin yet existing after the fall of Jerusalem, or it may betray the fact that the evangelist wrote down at the very time some details of the incident which formed the occasion of the following discourse, and never, in his later editing of the document, omitted or altered the form of his sentence. <span class="cmt_word">At the sheep</span> (<span class="accented">market</span>) or (<span class="accented">gate</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>a pool, surnamed in Hebrew Bethesda, having five</span> <span class="accented">porticoes</span> or <span class="cmt_word">porches</span><span class="accented">. The adjective</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span> requires some substantive to be introduced, and since there is no reference to any sheep market in the Old Testament, little justification can be found for the gloss contained in the Authorized Version. There was a "sheep gate" mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1, 32</a> and Nehemiah 12:39. There is no reason against this method of supplying the sense, except this, that there is no other instance of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, or "gate," being omitted after this fashion. The "sheep gate" stood next. in Nehemiah's recital, to the "fish gate," and it was built by the priests. The old "sheep gate" is now known by the name of St. Stephen's Gate, to the north of the Haram es-Sherif, or temple area from which the path leads down into the valley of the Kedron, and if "gate" be the proper term to add to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> and we have its site fixed by the modern St. Stephen's Gate, then we must look for the pool surnamed Bethesda in that vicinity. Eusebius and Jerome speak of a <span class="accented">piscina probatica</span> as visible in their day, but do not determine its site. Robinson ('Bib. Researches,' 1, p. 489) did not accept the identification of the sheep gate with St. Stephen's Gate, and places the former more to the south, and nearer to what is now called the Fountain of the Virgin. This fountain, on Robinson's visit, displayed some curious phenomena of periodical and intermittent ebullition, receiving a supply of water from another source. It was found by Robinson to be connected by a tunnel with the fountain of Siloam, and the relations of these wells have been quite recently submitted to fresh examination ('Palestine Expl. Soc. Rep.,' Oct. 1883). Robinson identified this pool with "Solomon's Pool" of Josephus and "King's Pool" of Nehemiah, and thought it might be the original pool of Bethesda. Neander and Tholuck incline to agree with him. The observations of Robinson have been confirmed by Tobler, and at least show that what certainly happens now in some of these fountains may have been phenomena constantly expected at some other fountain bearing the name now before us, on the northeastern side of the Haram area. Within the (sheep gate) St. Stephen's Gate the traditional site of Bethesda is pointed out. The modern name is <span class="accented">Birket lsrael</span>, and this tank, from the accumulation of rubbish, does not now show its original extent; neither does it now hold water, but receives the drainage of neighbouring houses (Colonel Wilson in 'Plot. Palestine,' vol. 1, pp. 66, 106-109). A church, near that of St. Anne, was built by the Crusaders over a well, in this immediate vicinity - a spot which was supposed to be the site of the angelic disturbance. Colonel Wilson prefers this traditional site to that fixed upon by Robinson. So also Sir G. Grove, in Smith's 'Bible Dict.' <span class="accented">The five porches</span>, or porticoes, may have been a columnar structure of pentagonal form, which sheltered the sick and the impotent folk. At present no indubitable relic of this building has been discovered. Alford (7th edit.) quotes a letter which makes it probable that Siloam was Bethesda, and the remains of four columns in the east wall of that pool, with four others in the centre, show that a structure with five openings or porches might easily have been erected there. <span class="accented">Bethesda</span>, which is said to be the Hebrew (that is, Aramaic) surname of the pool, is very doubtful. Probably this is the correct form of the text, though there are many variants, such as <span class="accented">Bethzatha</span>, in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, 33, Tischendorf (8th edit.); <span class="accented">Bethsaida</span>, in some versions and Tertullian. It seems generally allowed that its significance (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) is "house of grace or mercy," and that it derived its reference from the dispensation there of God's providential gifts. The healing virtue of waters charged with iron and carbonic acid and other gas is too well known to need reference, and the remarkable cures derived from their use may account forevery part of the statement which was here written by John. Eusebius speaks of these waters as "reddened," so he thought, with the blood of sacrifices, but tar more probably by chatybeate earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7964;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
