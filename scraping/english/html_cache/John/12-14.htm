He had foreknowledge of the colt&#8217;s location, underscoring His sovereign authority.<p>- The animal was &#8220;young,&#8221; and Luke notes that it had never been ridden (<a href="/luke/19-30.htm">Luke 19:30</a>). Such an untouched beast was considered specially set apart, fitting for sacred use (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>).<p>- A donkey, not a war-horse, highlights the Messiah&#8217;s peaceable mission (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>) and fulfills God&#8217;s purposeful plan: the King comes in humility rather than military might.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus sat on it</b><p>- By sitting on the colt, Jesus publicly declared His messianic identity. Kings in Israel signaled their royal authority by riding a mule or donkey into the city (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33, 38</a>).<p>- The scene contrasts sharply with worldly power. <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a> pictures Christ&#8217;s future return on a white horse for judgment; here He rides a humble donkey, announcing salvation and peace.<p>- The disciples&#8217; obedience (<a href="/mark/11-6.htm">Mark 11:6</a>) and the crowd&#8217;s reception (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>) show that the rightful King has arrived, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/118-25.htm">Psalm 118:25-26</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as it is written:</b><p>- John immediately anchors the event in Scripture, quoting <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> in the next verse (<a href="/john/12-15.htm">John 12:15</a>). The phrase &#8220;as it is written&#8221; affirms the unbreakable reliability of God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>).<p>- Every detail&#8212;the specific animal, the timing at Passover, the public acclaim&#8212;was foreseen centuries earlier, demonstrating that Jesus is the promised Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>).<p>- This fulfillment invites trust: the same Scriptures that foretold His first coming assure believers of His saving work and future return (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-14.htm">John 12:14</a> records more than a mode of transportation; it unveils the deliberate, prophetic presentation of Jesus as Israel&#8217;s humble yet sovereign King. The young donkey speaks of peace and divine planning, Jesus&#8217; seated posture proclaims royal authority tempered by meekness, and the appeal to what &#8220;is written&#8221; roots the moment in the unerring promises of Scripture. Together these elements call us to recognize, rejoice in, and submit to the Messiah who fulfills God&#8217;s Word perfectly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon.</span>--St. John simply mentions this to introduce the prophecy. The others all give the incidents in detail. "Having found," does not imply that the colt was found without the search which the other Evangelists record. (Comp. the same word in <a href="/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35</a>.) It has been noted, as illustrating the fact, that the word "found" includes the sending the disciples to look for the colt, that it is the same Greek word which Archimedes used when he found the object of his search, and cried, <span class= "ital">Eureka! Eureka!</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written.</span> The whole account of the process by which our Lord secured this <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is described at great length by the synoptists (see <a href="/matthew/21-2.htm">Matthew 21:2</a>; <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12</a>; <a href="/luke/19-30.htm">Luke 19:30</a>). The foal implies that the animal had never borne another burden. The account of Matthew refers to the mother and the foal, as though they were inseparable, and together bore the sacred burden. Mr. Holman Hunt, in his picture of the 'Triumph of the Innocents,' has represented the beast bearing Mary and her Child as accompanied by the colt. The entire process of securing both must have taken time, and augmented the excitement. Christ at length, on the eve of his Passion which he so distinctly foreshadowed, allowed the enthusiasm of the people to prevail, and accepted the homage. The Galilee pilgrims take up the demonstration, which was commenced, as we see from John's Gospel, by "the Jews" and those Jerusalemites who had been profoundly moved by the significance of the resurrection of Lazarus. The circumstances thus elucidated from the four narratives, reveal undesigned coincidences. The entry into Jerusalem did not take place till the afternoon, and so we find that all that our Lord did on arrival was to "go to the temple, look round on all things, and, now that the even was come, to revisit Bethany with the twelve" (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/12-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finding</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#8017;&#961;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Heur&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2147.htm">Strong's 2147: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary heuro, which heureo is used for it in all the tenses except the present and imperfect to find.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a young donkey,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#957;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(onarion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3678.htm">Strong's 3678: </a> </span><span class="str2">A young ass.
