This phrase indicates a direct response to their accusations, showcasing Jesus' authority and willingness to engage with religious leaders. The use of "answered" suggests a defense or explanation, highlighting the tension between Jesus and the Jewish authorities.<p><b>&#8220;To this very day</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity and ongoing nature of God's work. It suggests that God's activity did not cease after creation but continues in sustaining and governing the world. The phrase "to this very day" implies that God's work is not bound by human constraints such as the Sabbath, which is a key point in the context of the Sabbath controversy.<p><b>My Father is at His work</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to God as "My Father," indicating a unique and intimate relationship with God. This was a radical claim, as it implied equality with God, which was considered blasphemous by the Jewish leaders. The concept of God working continuously is rooted in Jewish understanding of God's providence and care for creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, which states that God does not slumber or sleep.<p><b>and I too am working.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus aligns His actions with those of the Father, asserting His divine authority and mission. This statement reinforces the idea that Jesus' works, including His miracles and teachings, are in harmony with God's will. It also foreshadows the greater works Jesus would accomplish, such as His death and resurrection. Theologically, this phrase underscores the unity of the Father and the Son, a theme that is further developed in the Gospel of John, particularly in <a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>, where Jesus states, "I and the Father are one."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Jewish leaders who are questioning His actions on the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>- They are challenging Jesus because He healed a man on the Sabbath, which they considered a violation of the law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father (God)</a></b><br>- Referred to by Jesus as "My Father," indicating a unique and intimate relationship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>- The day of rest in Jewish law, which is central to the conflict in this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where this event takes place, a significant location for Jewish religious life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_work.htm">Understanding Divine Work</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that God's work is continuous, even on the Sabbath.

Similar moments appear when Jesus addresses Sabbath controversy in <a href="/matthew/12-11.htm">Matthew 12:11-12</a> and <a href="/luke/13-15.htm">Luke 13:15-16</a>, showing that mercy and restoration align with God&#8217;s heart every day.<p>&#8226;

His answer to this charge is that His action was the result of His Sonship and unity with that God. The very idea of God implied action. This was familiar to the thought of the day. Comp., <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the contemporary Philo, "God never ceases working; but as to burn is the property of fire, and to be cold is the property of snow, thus also to work is the property of God, and much the more, inasmuch as He is the origin of action for all others" (<span class= "ital">Legis Allegor.</span> i. 3. See the whole section. The English reader will find it in Bohn's Ed., vol i., p. 53). The rest on the seventh day was the completion of the works of creation (see this stated emphatically in <a href="/context/genesis/2-2.htm" title="And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). It was not, it could not be, a cessation in divine work, or in the flow of divine energy. That knew nor day nor night, nor summer nor winter, nor Sabbath nor Jubilee. For man, and animal, and tree, and field, this alternation of a time of production and a time of reception was needed, but God was the ever-constant source of energy and life for all in heaven and earth and sea. The power going forth to heal that sufferer was the same power which sustained them in well-being. The strength which passed through his half-dead frame, and bade it live, was the same which every Sabbath morning awoke them from death's image, sleep, and would awake from death itself (<a href="/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>). The sun shone, and fruitful showers fell, and flower burst its bud, and harvest ripened, and they themselves, in energy of life, had grown on every day alike. God ever worketh up to this present moment. That God is also Father. The Son, therefore, worketh in the same way. This poor sufferer, lying helpless, is of the same human nature with the Son of God. He has in faith and hope made himself receptive of the divine energy, and that energy which can know no Sabbath, but is ever going forth to every heart that can receive it, hath made him whole.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="accented">The claim of special relation with the Father.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Jesus answered them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; here and ver. 19 are the only places where the author uses this aorist, <span class="cmt_word">My Father worketh hitherto;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. until now</span>; has not, has never, ceased from working. Some critics, eager for disparaging comment, have said "this is point blank denial of the sabbath rest of the Creator as exhibited in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1, 2</a>, and <a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>. But, on the contrary, it is the true exposition of those grand utterances. God through his Logos, the Father through his Son, did bring his strictly <span class="accented">creative</span> works to an end with the six days; but then he entered on the seventh day, the rest of his preserving, protective, reproductive energy; then he began to pursue his redeeming and quickening operations in all regions of his dominion. My Father worketh, energizes, until now. His "rest" is an infinite activity of wisdom and power, of righteousness and mercy. The true sabbath is this rest of God. Man has to enter into this rest, and cooperate with and utterly abandon himself to the will of God. Sabbath keeping is the great symbol of such entire satisfaction with God. The activities from which man has to cease on the holy day are man's own, man's self-centred labours; but he, too, may combine the highest activity with profound repose. "<span class="accented">My Father worketh until now, and I work</span> - I, who am his Instrument, his Word, his Manifestation, his Messenger, abstaining from all mere self-originated, self-poised, self-centering toil, I <span class="accented">work with him for him.</span> I work obviously and visibly that you may see for yourselves what he has ever been doing silently and unobserved." Philo had said ('Leg. All.,' 1:3) "that God never ceases to create, nor takes a holiday from his works;" and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> had grasped, as an echo of Christ's own teaching, the perpetuity of Divine rest through all the ages of work; but the naked thought here soars far above them both. The dawning of every clay, the opening of the flowers, the flowing of the rivers, the sustenance of vegetable, animal, and human life, reveal through every moment of the agelong sabbath rest, and on every sabbath day, his intense and constant activity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(apekrinato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
