This teaching is part of a larger conversation where Jesus explains spiritual truths using physical metaphors. His words often challenged listeners to think beyond the literal and understand deeper spiritual meanings.<p><b>while teaching</b><br>Jesus was known as a rabbi or teacher, and His method of teaching often included parables, direct instruction, and dialogue. His teachings were authoritative and often contrasted with the interpretations of the religious leaders of the time. Teaching was a central aspect of His ministry, as He sought to reveal the Kingdom of God and fulfill the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>in the synagogue</b><br>The synagogue was a central place for Jewish worship, teaching, and community gatherings. It served as a place for reading the Torah and discussing the Scriptures. Jesus frequently taught in synagogues, which provided Him with a platform to reach the Jewish community and engage with religious leaders. Synagogues were scattered throughout Jewish regions, and their presence in towns like Capernaum highlights the importance of religious life in these communities.<p><b>in Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often referred to as His "own city" (<a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>). It was a fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee and served as a base for Jesus' operations. Archaeological findings, such as the remains of a synagogue and Peter's house, provide insights into the historical and cultural context of the area. Capernaum's location made it a hub for trade and interaction, allowing Jesus' teachings to spread widely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>A Jewish place of worship and teaching, where Jesus often taught and engaged with the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which served as a central hub for Jesus' ministry in Galilee.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_context.htm">The Importance of Context</a></b><br>Understanding the setting of Jesus' teachings helps us grasp the full meaning of His words.

Note on <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>), we have good reason for believing that modern discovery has traced out the foundations of the synagogue in which this discourse was spoken. It was a gift to the Jews by a devout Gentile (<a href="/luke/7-5.htm" title="For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.">Luke 7:5</a>), and as such, of greater architectural beauty than was common among Galilean synagogues. Corinthian capitals and a heavy cornice and frieze are among the ruins, and the traveller's eye may rest to-day on the very ornaments which our Lord's eyes saw there eighteen centuries ago. On one of the lintels of the door he may trace a sculptured pot of manna, and connect with it the thoughts of the manna which the fathers did eat, and died: just as in a Christian church he may trace the emblems of the bread of life, which a man may eat of and not die. A plan and details of the synagogue, with an account by Captain Wilson, R.E., will be found in the <span class= "ital">Second Quarterly Statement</span> of the Palestine Exploration Fund (June, 1869).

It was, as we learn from the synoptists, his second and habitual home in Galilee. In Warren's 'Recovery of Jerusalem,' p. 344, a description of <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> and of its ruins occurs, and amongst them the remains of an ancient synagogue. "On turning over a large block of stone," says Wilson, "we found the pot of manna engraved on its face." "This very symbol may have been before the eyes of those who heard the Lord's words" (Westcott). This note of time and place is important, as showing that thus early in his ministry our Lord proclaimed in Galilee, as well as in Jerusalem, the deepest things of his own consciousness and intentions; that the teaching in Galilee was not, as Renan would have us apprehend, nothing more than an idyllic progress of personal popularity and rapturous hosanna. The Lord knew that he must offend those who would by force constrain him to be their Messianic King, and made it by this discourse clear that spiritual communion with his inner life, as a Divine, Heaven-sent Representative, as One suffering and dying for the world, was the only and supreme condition of deriving and sharing in his own supernatural and eternal life. The effect of this discourse and the crisis that followed in his public ministry is now described. The words of Jesus led to deeper faith and to a more determined antagonism. "The light shone into the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." "He came to his own, and his own received him not; but to as many as received, he gave power to become sons of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-59.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
