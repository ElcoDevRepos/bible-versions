The water jar represents her initial purpose for coming to the well, which was to draw water. Her leaving it behind symbolizes a shift in priorities after her encounter with Jesus. This action can be seen as an indication of her immediate acceptance of Jesus' message and her eagerness to share it. In a broader biblical context, this act can be compared to the disciples leaving their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>). It signifies a turning point and a new beginning.<p><b>went back into the town</b><br>The town referred to is Sychar, a Samaritan city. The Samaritans were a mixed race, partly Jewish and partly Gentile, and were often despised by the Jews (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). The woman's return to the town highlights the breaking of social barriers, as she, a Samaritan woman with a questionable past, becomes a messenger of the Messiah. This reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, which reaches beyond traditional Jewish boundaries.<p><b>and said to the people</b><br>The woman&#8217;s boldness in speaking to the people is noteworthy, given her social status and past. Her testimony is a powerful example of personal evangelism. Despite her previous reputation, her encounter with Jesus transforms her into a credible witness. This aligns with the biblical theme that God often uses unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). Her testimony also prefigures the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where believers are called to share the gospel with all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritan_woman.htm">The Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>A central figure in this passage, she encounters Jesus at Jacob's well.

Most commentators suggest that she left it, intending by the very act to come back again shortly for water. But this is scarcely the idea conveyed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>. Archdeacon Watkius truly says that this notice "is a mark of the presence of him who has related the incidents." <span class="cmt_word">And she went her way to the city</span> - probably beyond her home (see note, ver. 7), constituting herself at once the messenger and missionary of the new Teacher and Prophet, who had declared himself to be the Messiah - <span class="cmt_word">and saith to the men</span> whom she found in the marketplace or highway, <span class="cmt_word">Come, see a man who told me all things that</span> <span class="accented">ever <span class="cmt_word"></span>I did.</span> This exaggeration of the self-revelation was due to the deep conviction of her mind that the Prophet had read her whole life - its weakness and its follies, and it may have been its sins and crimes, not unknown, alas! to others as well. Chrysostom says, "She might have said, 'Come and see One that prophesieth;' but when the soul is aflame with holy fire it looks then to nothing earthly, neither to glory nor to shame, but belongs to one thing alone, the flame which occupieth it." There is a touch of <span class="accented">naivete</span>, of loquacity, of impetuous womanhood, about this, that thrills with life. She was not afraid, in the first gush of her new-found joy, to brave the unflattering scorn of the men to whom such a confession was made; and then, in most natural and appropriate fashion, added, <span class="cmt_word">He is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not however the Christ, is he?</span> The question, by its form, suggests a negative answer; "but," Westcott says, "hope bursts through it (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>)." She knows that he <span class="accented">is</span> the Christ, but she wishes the townspeople to guess it - to come to a like conclusion with herself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
