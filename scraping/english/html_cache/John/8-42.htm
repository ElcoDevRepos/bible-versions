In the context of <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees and Jewish leaders, who are questioning His authority and identity. This setting is crucial as it highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities of His time.<p><b>If God were your Father</b><br>Here, Jesus challenges the spiritual paternity of His listeners. The Jewish leaders prided themselves on being descendants of Abraham and considered God their Father. However, Jesus implies that true spiritual kinship with God is not based on lineage but on recognizing and accepting Him, the Son. This echoes the theme in <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>, where becoming children of God is linked to receiving Christ.<p><b>you would love Me</b><br>Love for Jesus is presented as evidence of a genuine relationship with God. This statement underscores the inseparable connection between the Father and the Son. In <a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>, Jesus reiterates that those who love Him will be loved by the Father, emphasizing that love for Christ is a hallmark of true discipleship.<p><b>for I have come here from God</b><br>Jesus asserts His divine origin and mission. This claim is central to the Gospel of John, which repeatedly emphasizes Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). His coming from God signifies His pre-existence and divine authority, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's divine nature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p><b>I have not come on My own</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' submission to the Father's will, a recurring theme in His ministry. It reflects the unity and purpose within the Trinity, as seen in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, where Jesus states that He can do nothing by Himself but only what He sees the Father doing. This submission is a model for believers in their relationship with God.<p><b>but He sent Me</b><br>The sending of Jesus by the Father underscores His role as the divinely appointed Savior. This mission is rooted in the love and redemptive plan of God, as expressed in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. The concept of being sent also connects to the Old Testament prophets, who were sent by God to deliver His message, but Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of this divine sending.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Jewish leaders and people who are questioning His authority and identity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus is speaking.

As the Son of God He had eternal fellowship with the Father.

(Comp. <a href="/john/16-27.htm" title="For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.">John 16:27</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">for not even of Myself am I come, but He sent Me;</span> as opposed to the thought that His origin was distinct from the Father. His coming was not His own act, but was a mission from God to the world.<p>But if He is sent from God, if He is present with them from God, if He proceeded from the Father, it must be that all who are true children of God would recognise and love Him.<p>It is important to note here that in our Lord's own words there is an assertion of the oneness of nature and of will with that of the Father, and yet the distinction of person is maintained. He is come from God, but He proceeded from the divine essence.

By <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> he implies an even sublimer conception of the prenatal glory, and that, as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews puts it, "he was the Effulgence of his glory, and the express Image of his substance." <span class="cmt_word">And I am come.</span> I am here face to face with you. Meyer and others would make both verbs depend on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: but if we are right in the special meaning of the preposition, the force of it would be lost in the second clause. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> refers to his eternal procession from the very nature of God, and special indication of it when he took our human nature up into his own; and the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> refers to his presence and appearance in their midst as a "Man who told them the truth." <span class="cmt_word">For neither have I come.</span> The perfect tense here is used in contrast to the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, to show that he has the whole past of his career as a divinely sent Messenger present in his consciousness. And he establishes the fact that he has proceeded from God by the dismission of every other alternative. <span class="accented">I have not come <span class="cmt_word"></span>from myself</span>, as an act of self-determination; I have not come to do my own will, but the Father's. I have not come on any self-chosen, self-honouring path, with motives of self-interest; <span class="cmt_word">but</span> in strict obedience to the Father's injunction - <span class="cmt_word">he sent me.</span> You would have loved me, not hated me, you would have trusted me and rejoiced in me, and not sought to kill me, if God were your Father; for you would then have felt all through my career that <span class="accented">that</span> One Father, of whom you boast an intimate knowledge, was revealing himself as One near to you, close to you, in the bare fact of my presence among you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
