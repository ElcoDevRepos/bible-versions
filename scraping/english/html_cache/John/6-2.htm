This reflects the social and religious climate of first-century Judea, where people were eagerly anticipating a messianic figure. The crowd's following of Jesus also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah drawing people to Himself, such as in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, which speaks of the Servant who will bring justice to the nations.<p><b>because they saw the signs</b><br>The term "signs" refers to the miracles Jesus performed, which served as evidence of His divine authority and messianic identity. In the Gospel of John, signs are not just miracles but are symbolic acts that reveal deeper spiritual truths about Jesus' nature and mission. The signs are meant to lead people to faith, as seen in <a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>, where it is stated that these signs are recorded so that people may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.<p><b>He was performing on the sick</b><br>Jesus' healing of the sick demonstrates His compassion and power over physical ailments, which were often seen as a result of sin or demonic influence in the cultural context of the time. These healings are a foretaste of the ultimate healing and restoration that Jesus will bring in His kingdom. They also fulfill prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our sicknesses and carrying our pains.

It does not mean simply that they saw these miracles on the west of the lake, and followed Him across it; but that He kept on healing the sick, and that the crowds kept on following Him. The usual caravan-road for the northern pilgrims was on the east side of the lake, and the throng would increase as He went.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was following him a vast crowd, because they were spectators of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">signs he was working on those that were sick.</span> The imperfect tenses here reveal a period of time that had elapsed; a group and series of healings which had touched the heart of the people. Their "following" had not been by ship, but round the head of the lake, and across the ford of the Jordan, which is still situated about two miles from the point where the river flows into the Sea of Galilee. The multitudes would easily learn the direction of the well known boat with its solitary sail, and would be, some of them, ready at the landing place, to greet the Lord on his arrival. Many hours might elapse before the crowd had reached such vast proportions as we subsequently find. It may easily have been swollen by curious and inquisitive pilgrims, or by the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, intent on a sight of the Prophet who had preached the sermon, who had spoken in wondrous parables, who had given such striking proof that "God was with him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">A large</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(polys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">crowd</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8004;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ochlos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3793.htm">Strong's 3793: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of echo; a throng; by implication, the rabble; by extension, a class of people; figuratively, a riot.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">followed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#973;&#952;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kolouthei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_190.htm">Strong's 190: </a> </span><span class="str2">To accompany, attend, follow.
