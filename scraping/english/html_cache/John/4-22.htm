The Samaritans had a syncretistic religion, blending elements of Judaism with their own traditions. They accepted only the Pentateuch and rejected the rest of the Hebrew Scriptures, leading to an incomplete understanding of God. This lack of full revelation resulted in worship that was not based on the full truth of God's nature and His redemptive plan. The Samaritans worshiped at Mount Gerizim, which was contrary to the Jewish understanding of worship centered in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>we worship what we do know,</b><br>Here, Jesus speaks from the perspective of the Jews, who had the complete Hebrew Scriptures, including the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. This comprehensive revelation provided a fuller understanding of God's character and His covenant promises. The Jews had the temple in Jerusalem, which was the center of worship as ordained by God. This phrase emphasizes the importance of worshiping God with a correct understanding based on His revealed Word.<p><b>for salvation is from the Jews.</b><br>This statement highlights the Jewish people's role in God's redemptive plan. The Jews were chosen as the people through whom God would bring salvation to the world. This is seen in the covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the promises of a Messiah. Jesus, as the fulfillment of these promises, was born a Jew, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.

It can be no difficulty to those who seek to form their judgments from the Gospel as it is. Assume that the Gospel belongs to the Greek thought of the close of the second century, and the verse must be omitted, though it is certainly part of the original text; accept the Gospel as belonging to the Hebrew thought of the first century, and this touch of Jewish theology is in entire harmony with it. The contrast between the Samaritan and the Jewish worship lay in its history, its state at that time, and its rejection of the fuller teaching of the prophetical books of the Old Testament. "In every way the Jews had much advantage, but chiefly that unto them were committed the oracles of God." Little as they knew the treasure they possessed, they were the guardians of spiritual truth for the world, and in a sense deeper than they could fathom, "salvation was of the Jews." (Comp. <a href="/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>; <a href="/context/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4-5</a>, Notes; <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2</a>.)<p>The "we" of this verse is in answer to the "ye" of <a href="/john/4-20.htm" title="Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.">John 4:20</a>. She identifies Him with those who claim Jerusalem as the place of worship. That "ye" contained its own answer. In using it she had said that the Messiah was of the Jews. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye worship that which</span> (not "him whom") <span class="cmt_word">ye know not</span>. "That which" points to the essence and inner character of the object of their worship. They gave him a name, but they were comparatively ignorant of, and confessedly hostile as a people to, the revelation that the Father had made. They fell back on a past of rigid orthodoxy but of limited range. They rejected every portion of the Old Testament with the exception of the Pentateuch, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the entire historical treatment of the primeval faith; even that very essence of it which involved the progressive and expanding conception of the character of God - the perpetuity and continuous renovation of relations, the prophetic insight into providence, the sublime liturgy of a ceaseless worship, the prediction of a Messianic glory which, in the fulness of the times, should complete and complement all that preceded. They were, by their prejudices and hostility, kept ignorant of and unacquainted with the Name that was above every name. In contradistinction from this, we Jews, to whom as a nation you rightly conclude I belong, and as a representative of whom I speak - <span class="cmt_word">We worship that which we know.</span> Christ in this place, more distinctly perhaps than in any portion of the four Gospels, places himself as a worshipper side by side with his hearers. Here, moreover, he identifies himself with the Jews - becomes their interpreter and mouthpiece and representative. When a question arises, which of the two has the larger amount of truth, Jew or Gentile, Jew or Samaritan, he pronounced in stringent terms in favour of the Jew. The revelation advancing beyond the narrow limitations of Samaritan nationality as to place, and time, and historic fact, with its pregnant ritual, has revealed the Father to us Jews, in <span class="cmt_word">this</span> <span class="cmt_word">respect and because the salvation</span> of which Moses partly dreamed, but which has been the burden of every prophecy and psalm - the "salvation" which gives meaning to all our knowledge, <span class="cmt_word">is from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, not "belonging to," but "proceeding from," <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>; <a href="/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22, 52</a>) <span class="cmt_word">the Jews.</span> The Jews have been the school where the highest lessons have been taught, the richest experiences felt, the noblest lives lived, the types and shadows of good things to come most conspicuous. We cannot avoid reading between the lines the sublime enthusiasm which Paul gathered from this class of teaching ("To whom pertaineth the adoption,...and covenant,...whose are the fathers, and to whom were committed the oracles of God,... and from whom as concerning the flesh Christ came"). The utterance is profoundly significant, as it is a powerful repudiation of the theory which makes the author of this Fourth Gospel a Gentile of the second century, with a Gnostic antipathy to Judaism and Jews. The contradiction to this theory indubitably involved in this verse has led to the wildest conjectures - even the suggestion of a Jewish gloss on some ancient manuscripts of the Gospel has been one desperate device to save the theory. <span class="accented">Taut pis pour les fairs.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/4-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
