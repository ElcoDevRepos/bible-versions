It was inexpensive and readily available, often used to quench thirst. This detail highlights the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, which prophesies that the Messiah would be given vinegar to drink. The presence of the jar indicates the proximity to the Roman soldiers, who were responsible for the crucifixion, and their indifference to the suffering of Jesus.<p><b>So they soaked a sponge in the wine,</b><br>The use of a sponge was practical, as it could absorb the liquid and be easily lifted to Jesus' mouth. Sponges were common in the Roman world, often used for cleaning purposes. This act of offering wine to Jesus can be seen as a moment of both cruelty and unintended mercy, as it momentarily alleviated His thirst. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/22-15.htm">Psalm 22:15</a>, which speaks of the Messiah's intense thirst.<p><b>put it on a stalk of hyssop,</b><br>Hyssop is a plant mentioned frequently in the Bible, often associated with purification and sacrifice.

The &#8220;sour wine&#8221; (cheap, diluted vinegar) was a common refreshment for soldiers (see <a href="/luke/23-36.htm">Luke 23:36</a>) and fulfills <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, &#8220;They gave me vinegar for my thirst.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

A simple sponge becomes an instrument of prophecy and mercy.<p>&#8226; The soldiers&#8217; action unwittingly advances God&#8217;s foreordained plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>): what they intend as routine or mockery matches Scripture word for word.<p>&#8226; Notice the tenderness of God&#8217;s care&#8212;even in suffering, Jesus is allowed a brief moistening of His lips so He can cry, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; clearly (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put it on a stalk of hyssop,</b><p>&#8226; Hyssop appears at the first Passover, used to apply lamb&#8217;s blood to Israel&#8217;s doorposts (<a href="/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>). Now, hyssop again touches the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), linking the two events.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a> recalls hyssop in covenant rituals; the writer later declares Jesus&#8217; blood &#8220;obtained eternal redemption&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The small, fragile plant reminds us that God delights in using humble means to display His glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lifted it to His mouth.</b><p>&#8226; This gesture fulfills prophecy and demonstrates Christ&#8217;s voluntary submission (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; It sets the stage for His final declaration, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221;&#8212;the triumphant proclamation that the debt of sin is paid in full (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Though lifted by soldiers&#8217; hands, the scene ultimately lifts up Jesus before all humanity as the only Savior (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/19-29.htm">John 19:29</a> shows that every detail of Calvary&#8212;down to a jar, a sponge, and a sprig of hyssop&#8212;unfolds exactly as Scripture promised. The sour wine reveals prophetic fulfillment, the sponge and hyssop recall the Passover, and the act of lifting it to Jesus&#8217; mouth prepares His victorious cry. What people meant as mere routine, God used to proclaim that the Lamb&#8217;s work is complete and salvation is secure for all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar.</span>--This vessel of the ordinary sour wine drunk by the Roman soldiers, was placed near in order to be given to those who were crucified. Thirst was always an accompaniment of death by crucifixion, and that the vessel of wine was prepared for this purpose is made probable by the mention of the sponge and hyssop (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/27-48.htm" title="And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.">Matthew 27:48</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And put it upon hyssop.</span>--This detail is peculiar to St. John. Bochart (<span class= "ital">Hierozoicon,</span> i. 2, 50) thinks that the plant was marjoram, or some plant like it, and he is borne out by ancient tradition. The stalks, from a foot to a foot and a half high, would be sufficient to reach to the cross. The plant is named in one other passage in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/9-19.htm" title="For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,">Hebrews 9:19</a>), and is frequent in the Greek of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">?z?v,</span> and the identification must always be uncertain, because we cannot know whether the Greek translation is based upon an identification of the plant, or upon a similarity in the sound of the names.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was set there</span> <span class="cmt_word">a vessel full of vinegar</span>, probably for the use of the soldiers, and occasionally offered to the sufferers to soothe a part of their torment.
