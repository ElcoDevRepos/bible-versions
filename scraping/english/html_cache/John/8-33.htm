This claim highlights their pride in being part of God's chosen people, as Abraham is the patriarch of Israel (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The Jews believed that their descent from Abraham guaranteed them a special status before God. This statement reflects a common Jewish belief of the time that physical descent from Abraham was a source of spiritual security and privilege (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We have never been slaves to anyone.&#8221;</b><br>This claim is historically inaccurate, as the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>) and experienced subjugation under various empires, including the Babylonians and Romans. The statement likely reflects a sense of spiritual or national pride, possibly indicating that they viewed themselves as spiritually free due to their covenant relationship with God. It may also reflect a denial of their current political situation under Roman rule, emphasizing their belief in spiritual freedom despite physical circumstances.<p><b>How can You say we will be set free?&#8221;</b><br>The question challenges Jesus' statement about freedom, revealing a misunderstanding of His message. Jesus speaks of spiritual freedom from sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>), while the Jewish leaders focus on physical or political freedom. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' teachings are misunderstood by His audience, who often interpret His words in a literal or earthly sense rather than a spiritual one. The concept of true freedom in Christ is further explored in Paul's writings, such as in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where he speaks of freedom from the law and sin through faith in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is engaging in a dialogue with the Jewish people, challenging their understanding of freedom and spiritual bondage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_people.htm">Jewish People</a></b><br>Specifically, the descendants of Abraham who are conversing with Jesus.

It had been promised to Abraham, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies" (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>). This seed they were. This promise they interpret of national prosperity. Abraham's seed in bondage! the thought is impossible. As in other cases (comp. <a href="/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>), they forget part of the facts of history, for they have never learned their lessons. The Egyptian slavery and Babylonian captivity are passed over. That very generation witnessed around them the insignia of Rome, paid taxes to Rome, used the coin of Rome, but it was the policy of the empire to leave to the subject provinces a nominal freedom; and it may be that stress is laid on the words "been in bondage," which occur nowhere else in the Gospels. Those then living may have said with truth that they had never been in actual bondage, and the current expectation of the Messiah at that time may have led them to interpret the promise to Abraham specially of themselves. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33-46.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">The offer of spiritual freedom to the seed of Abraham provoked bitter hostility and misapprehension.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">We be Abraham's seed</span> - taking the highest position of national grandeur and racial pride. Vast were the pretensions which the Jews often assumed from this lofty ancestry. "They were all children of kings;" "Solomon's feast was not too good for them;" "He was heir of the world;" "They were the inheritors in him of all the nations." They had rung this cry into the ears of John the Baptist, when this last prophet had called upon them for repentance. Their following boast is difficult to understand: <span class="cmt_word">We have never yet been enslaved to anyone;</span> and great difference of opinion has prevailed over the meaning cf. these words. It is incredible that John should represent: the Jews as ignorant of their national political history. The first word of their Decalogue included a reference to the "house of bondage" from which Jehovah had delivered the seed of Abraham. Moreover, their political humiliation at the hand of the border kingdoms of Assyria, Babylon, and Syria was the perpetual theme of prophet and psalmist. The terrible reverses that they had subsequently experienced at the hand of Antiochus and of the Roman power, and the galling submission to Rome which at the moment was rousing their fiercest passion, would render any such boast simply preposterous. Godet's suggestion, that they were making a boast of their personal civil freedom, that Abraham's seed were not sold into positive slavery, however mortifying their political servitude had proved, is far fetched and too far away from the facts of the case; neither does it harmonize with the character of this angry retort. Probably a reference is made to the ideal freedom from slavery and from dependence which they had, in their hour of deepest depression from all and every form of tyranny whatsoever, religiously maintained. They did, as their wonderful psalter shows, cherish a conviction that David's throne and Abraham's inheritance ideally stood through all the ages, lustrous and magnificent to the eye of faith. When the holy and beautiful house was burned with fire, when their exile was complete, they still saw all visible things, even "heaven and earth," departing or rolled up like a scroll, while their Creator and redeeming King was seated still on his eternal throne. From St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, they clearly held that the mere possession of the Law, whether they kept it or not, was their much-prized pledge of independence from all other authority or servitude. If so, they may have been on this occasion boasting of their ideal freedom in virtue of their he reditary privileges, and forgetful of the lessons even of the agelong story of Ishmael and Esau, and the deportation and abolition of Israel as a nation. One can scarcely refrain a momentary thrill of admiration at the hardihood of their eager faith, and the overwhelming strength of confidence they manifested in their destiny as a people. All the spiritual salvation and ideal freedom which they desired they possessed as children of Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">How sayest thou</span> - "Upon what possible principle dost thou promise to us that which we already are proud of possessing, viz. glorious liberty?"
