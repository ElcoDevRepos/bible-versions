The stone covering the tomb was a common burial practice in ancient Jewish culture, used to seal the entrance of a cave-like tomb. Jesus' directive to remove the stone is a precursor to the miracle He is about to perform, showing His power over the grave. This act also requires faith from those present, as removing the stone would expose the decaying body. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus' own resurrection, where the stone was also rolled away from His tomb.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, by now he stinks,&#8221; said Martha, the sister of the dead man.</b><br>Martha's response highlights the human perspective and the reality of death. Her concern about the odor indicates that Lazarus has been dead long enough for decomposition to begin, which in Jewish belief, signified that the soul had left the body. This detail underscores the hopelessness of the situation from a human standpoint, making the miracle even more profound. Martha's address to Jesus as "Lord" shows her respect and belief in His power, yet her statement reveals a struggle to fully comprehend His ability to overcome death.<p><b>&#8220;It has already been four days.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of four days is crucial in understanding the magnitude of the miracle. In Jewish tradition, it was believed that the soul hovered around the body for three days after death, hoping to re-enter it. By the fourth day, the soul was thought to have departed, making resurrection impossible. This timing emphasizes that Lazarus' resurrection is a divine act, beyond any natural explanation. It also serves to strengthen the faith of the witnesses and foreshadows Jesus' own resurrection, which would occur on the third day, defying expectations and affirming His identity as the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is about to perform a miraculous act that demonstrates His power over life and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/martha.htm">Martha</a></b><br>The sister of Lazarus, she expresses concern about the practical implications of opening the tomb, showing her human perspective and doubt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The deceased brother of Martha and Mary, whose resurrection will serve as a powerful sign of Jesus' divine authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The place where Lazarus is buried, symbolizing death and the finality of human life without divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The village where this event takes place, located near Jerusalem, and a place where Jesus often visited.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_overcomes_doubt.htm">Faith Overcomes Doubt</a></b><br>Martha's initial doubt is a common human reaction, but Jesus calls us to trust in His power and promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_authority_over_death.htm">Jesus' Authority Over Death</a></b><br>This event foreshadows Jesus' own resurrection and His ultimate victory over death, offering hope to all believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_precedes_miracles.htm">Obedience Precedes Miracles</a></b><br>Jesus commands the stone to be removed, requiring an act of obedience before the miracle occurs.

Jesus is not suggesting; He is taking charge, just as He will one day &#8220;command all who are in the graves to come out&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The stone is a real, physical barrier&#8212;and also a vivid picture of anything that keeps us from seeing God&#8217;s power. By calling for it to be removed, Jesus shows that human obedience often precedes divine intervention (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; He involves the crowd. They cannot raise the dead, but they can roll a stone; He lets them share in the work so they will share in the wonder (<a href="/john/11-40.htm">John 11:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment foreshadows His own tomb. Another stone will be rolled away (<a href="/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>), proving that nothing&#8212;neither rock nor death&#8212;can restrain the Son of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Lord, by now he stinks,&#8221; said Martha, the sister of the dead man.</b><p>&#8226; Martha addresses Him as &#8220;Lord,&#8221; yet her senses cry out against His command. Faith meets earthly reality, and the clash is honest (<a href="/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The stench underscores the finality of death. This is no faint pulse revived but a corpse in decay, stressing the literal nature of the miracle (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Her words echo our own hesitations: we believe, but we picture the mess behind the stone and shrink back (<a href="/mark/9-24.htm">Mark 9:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Even so, Jesus does not rebuke her harshly; He moves forward, revealing that His power answers both the spiritual corruption sin brings (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>) and the physical corruption death brings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;It has already been four days.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The detail is intentional. Jesus delayed (<a href="/john/11-6.htm">John 11:6</a>) so that the miracle would be unmistakable. Jewish custom said the soul lingered near the body up to three days; the fourth day removed every shred of natural hope.<p>&#8226; Four days magnify His glory: &#8220;This sickness will not end in death, but is for God&#8217;s glory&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing previews a greater resurrection. If He can call a decomposing man back to life, then His own rising on the third day (<a href="/luke/24-6.htm">Luke 24:6&#8211;7</a>) and the future resurrection of all believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20&#8211;23</a>) are fully assured.<p>&#8226; The number also whispers of completeness&#8212;death has done its worst, and still Jesus overrules it (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a> captures the collision between Jesus&#8217; sovereign command and human apprehension. He orders the obstacle removed, invites cooperation, confronts decay, and times it so that His victory over death is beyond dispute. The verse reminds us that when Christ speaks, every barrier, every doubt, and even the irreversible grip of death itself must yield to His life-giving authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">Martha, the sister of him that was dead.</span>--This fact of close relationship is mentioned again to account for her remark. We know, from the whole narrative, that she was his sister; but this verse would say, not simply that Martha spoke, but that that in Martha which was sister to him who was dead spoke. She thinks that the form of him she loved has now passed to corruption; she cannot bear that her own eyes or the eyes of others should see it.<p><span class= "bld">For he hath been dead four days.</span>--The word "dead" is not expressed in the Greek, which says literally, <span class= "ital">for he hath been of the fourth day;</span> and the thought is rather of the sepulchre than of death--"for he hath been in the sepulchre four days." (Comp. <a href="/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.">John 11:17</a>.) The body had been embalmed (<a href="/john/11-44.htm" title="And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.">John 11:44</a>); but the manner of the Jews was to embalm only with spice, and to wrap in linen clothes (<a href="/context/john/19-40.htm" title="Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.">John 19:40-42</a>), and there is no evidence that they at any time followed the Egyptian method of embalming. The only instance of Jewish embalming mentioned in the Old Testament is that of Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2Chronicles 16:14</a>).<p>The fact that the body had been in the sepulcher four days is given by the sister as a proof that decomposition must have taken place, and expositors have generally assumed that it was so. This is, however, not stated in the text, and the assumption is opposed by the fact that there was an interval during which the sepulchre was open, and Jesus prayed to the Father (<a href="/context/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41-42</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> has rather the idea of "lift" than "roll away;" it is used for "take," "take away," "carry as a burden." <span class="cmt_word">Martha, the sister of him that was dead,</span> <span class="cmt_word">said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been four days here</span>. Martha's language is another singular illustration of the desire on her part to give a certain kind of advice and direction to our Lord, as though he might be the wiser and bettor for her monitions. The characterization of her as "the sister of the dead" man is not needed for identification, but rather to explain or justify her intrusion upon the solemn, stately direction of the Lord. She shrank from such an exposure of the body of her beloved brother, as an unnecessary act, since he was only to rise at the last day, or to be regarded <span class="accented">by</span> his faith in Christ before his death as having already passed from death and through death into a new life. She must have relinquished at that moment all hope of resurrection of the body of Lazarus there and then: <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he already stinketh." This is explained by many of the Fathers as proof that our Lord not only raised from death-swoon Jairus's daughter, and the young man on his way to burial, but also a putrefying corpse; thus giving three symbols of the effects of sin: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a young life blighted; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a man's energies dissipated and his condition apparently hopeless; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a type also of one dead in trespasses and sins (Trench on the Miracles) - one whose habits of trespass and bondage to evil seem to forbid all renewal. Godet thinks that Martha had special reasons for such a speech. Others, that all that we have here is the <span class="accented">speculation</span> or <span class="accented">lanai</span> of Martha, and that it must be so. She puts one more arrest, as it would seem, upon the free act and love of Jesus. This seems quite sufficient to account for the use of the word. It would seem that, for some reason, the body had not been fully embalmed, or she would not have used the expression. Still, all had been done with spices and perfumes that was intended. The T&uuml;bingen criticism eagerly lays hold on this point, as proof that the fourth evangelist intended by such a touch to exalt and exaggerate the wonder-working power of Christ. There is no need whatever to see in it more than Martha's sisterly love getting the better of her submission to her Master's order. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "For he is of the fourth day (dead) (buried)."
