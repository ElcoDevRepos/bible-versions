This double affirmation is unique to the Gospel of John and serves to highlight the authority of Jesus' words. In the cultural context of the time, such repetition was a way to underscore the reliability and seriousness of a statement, akin to a solemn oath.<p><b>whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate</b><br>The "sheepfold" refers to a protective enclosure for sheep, often made of stone walls with a single entrance. In biblical times, shepherds would lead their sheep into these enclosures for safety during the night. The "gate" symbolizes the legitimate and rightful way to enter, suggesting order and divine approval. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references to God as the shepherd of Israel (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>).<p><b>but climbs in some other way</b><br>This phrase implies deceit and illegitimacy. In the historical context, thieves would often attempt to bypass the gate to steal sheep, highlighting their unlawful intentions. Spiritually, this can be seen as a metaphor for false teachers or prophets who seek to lead God's people astray without divine authority or calling.<p><b>is a thief and a robber</b><br>The terms "thief" and "robber" are used to describe those who exploit and harm the flock for personal gain. In the cultural context, a thief might steal secretly, while a robber would use violence. This distinction underscores the danger posed by those who do not enter through the legitimate means. Biblically, this can be connected to warnings against false prophets and leaders who come to deceive (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>, <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>).

The verse calls every listener to reject counterfeit paths and trust the one true Gate who guarantees safety, salvation, and abundant life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Verily, verily, I say unto you.</span>--This formula is not used at the beginning of a fresh discourse, but is, in every case, the solemn introduction of some development of our Lord's deeper teaching. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.) We are not, then, to regard this chapter as a new subject, but as part of the teaching commenced in <a href="/john/9-35.htm" title="Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?">John 9:35</a>, and arising out of the sign of healing the blind man. This sign is present to their thoughts at the close of the discourse, in <a href="/john/10-21.htm" title="Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?">John 10:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold.</span>--The special form which the discourse here takes has been thought, with a probability which does not fall far short of certainty, due to the actual presence of a sheepfold with the shepherds and their flocks. (See <a href="/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>.) We know that Bethesda was near the "sheepgate," and we have seen that it is not improbably to be identified with a covered portion of the Pool of Siloam. (See Note on <a href="/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>.) In any case, there must have been sheepfolds sufficiently near to make it possible that they had arrived at one, and the change in the central points of the allegory find their most natural explanation in thoughts of the shifting scene on which it is based. The description of such a scene, by Bochart, written more than two centuries ago, has been borne out by all modern travellers. We have to think of an open fold, surrounded by a wall or railing, into which, at eventide, the shepherds lead their flocks, committing them, during the night, to the care of an under-shepherd, who guards the door. In the morning they knock and the porter opens the door, which has been securely fastened during the night, and each shepherd calls his own sheep, who know his voice and follow him to the pasturage. (Comp. Thomson, <span class= "ital">The Land and the Book,</span> vol. i., pp. 299-302.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-21.</span> - <p><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> <span class="accented">Christ the Shepherd of the flock of God</span>. The discourse which now follows was the Lord's parabolic or allegoric reply to the conduct of the Pharisaic malignants. These men, claiming to be infallible guides of the ignorant, to be veritable shepherds of the flock of God, had ignored the advent of the true and good Shepherd, had opposed the Divine call and supreme claim of the Messiah, had set themselves to disturb and dislocate the relations between him and those who saw his glory and found in him the Consolation of Israel. They had excommunicated the adoring disciple who had passed out of lifelong darkness into marvelous light. They had exaggerated the faint glimmer of light which had broken upon their own blindness into true vision. They had said, "We see," and thus shown themselves to be willfully in the wrong. Their sin abode upon them. The fold of God's sheep was something different from their own expectations and definitions. Their way into it proved that they did not know its true nature. To meet this crisis our Lord delivers a triad of related and parallel pictures, which differ from the ordinary parable (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>). The parable is a picture which is complete in its elf, and invites the reader to discover some answering spiritual truth. It consists of a careful setting forth of some physical fact, some fragment of biography, some personal or domestic detail. It is true to life and experience, and embodies some ethical principle or religious emotion; and while it does not explicitly teach either, yet it suggests them to the inquiring mind. The parables of the synoptic Gospels are not exclusive or rigid in their form. The so-called parable of "the Pharisee and the publican" and that of "the good Samaritan" are at once transformable into patterns or principles of action. The element of its own interpretation is also conspicuous in that of "the rich man and Lazarus" and "the rich fool." With these latter specimens of our Lord's teaching may be compared the allegoric illustrations of the present discourse. These pictures are "transparencies" (Godet), through which the Savior's spiritual teaching pours its own illumination. They both alike differ from the "fable," a form of address in which personal characters and activities are attributed (as in the apologue of Jotham, etc.) to the irrational or even to the inanimate creation. The first of the similitudes before us has more of the character of the parable proper, because it does not at once carry its own interpretation with it. Vers. 1-6 represent in parabolic form the claims of those who aspired to provide a "door," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a sure and safe entrance to the theocratic fold. In vers. 7-10 our Lord interprets and expands the first representation by giving special significance to the words he had already used, adding something to their meaning, and contrasting his own position with that of all others. From the eleventh to the eighteenth verse he once more reverts to the original picture, and claims to occupy a relation to the sheep of God's band of far more intimate and suggestive kind than what was connoted by the <span class="accented">door</span> into the fold. He is "the good Shepherd." In that capacity he adds other and marvelous features. The parabolic or allegorical language passes away into vivid description of the leading features of his work. The parable at last glows into burning metaphor. In the first paragraph our Lord gives a parabolic picture of flock and fold, door and porter, robber and shepherd. In the second paragraph he emphasizes the relation between the <span class="accented">door</span> and the fold, claiming to be "the <span class="accented">Door</span>." In the third he illustrates the function and the responsibility of the true "Shepherd," and the relation of the shepherd to the <span class="accented">flock</span>, and he claims to be the Shepherd of Israel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The parable of the fold and flock</span>, <span class="accented">the door and the porter</span>, <span class="accented">the robber and the shepherd</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- <span class="cmt_word"></span>Verily, verily</span>, betokens the deep solemnity and importance of the matter in hand, but not a complete break in the circumstances - neither a new audience nor a new theme. The adoption by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>), by Ezekiel (34.), and by Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/11-4.htm">Zechariah 11:4-17</a>) of similar imagery to denote the contrast between the true and false shepherds, and the anticipation by the prophets of a time when the true and good Shepherd would fulfill all Jehovah's pleasure, throws vivid light on these words of our Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</span> Several commentators of eminence have maintained that by "the <span class="accented">door</span>," in this first verse, our Lord (as in ver. 7) meant at once to designate himself. This is not necessary. He rather summons the Pharisees to recognize the fact that there is a door, a way of sure and divinely appointed admission to the "fold of the sheep," through which the veritable Shepherd passes, bringing his flock with him by well-known voice and manner. Later on, our Lord claims to be the one Way' by which all under-shepherds can gain true access to the flock, and all the sheep of God's pasture can find protection and freedom; but here he suggests the principle of discrimination between a true shepherd and a thief or robber. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is one who is selfishly seeking his own ends, and would avoid detection; the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is one who would use violent means to secure his purpose (Judas was a "thief," Barabbas was a "robber"). The false shepherd disdains the door, and climbs up some other way along his own selfish lines of action (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is used in this place only, equivalent to "from some other quarter than the ordinary home of the shepherd"). His purpose is not to benefit the sheep, but to seize them, or slaughter them for his own purposes (<a href="/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). The Lord suggests that many have assumed to sustain the relation of shepherd to the flock and fold of God, with no inward call either of commission or profession. They have been eager to insist on their own rights, have mistaken their own narrow traditions for the commandments of God, have imposed upon starved and worried souls their own selfish interpretations of that commandment, and have shown that they had no legitimate access to the hearts of men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">truly,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
