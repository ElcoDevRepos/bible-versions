Evening marks the beginning of a new day in Jewish tradition, as days are counted from sunset to sunset. This timing is also important in the narrative structure of the Gospel of John, as it often highlights transitions and significant events occurring at night or in the dark, symbolizing spiritual darkness or misunderstanding.<p><b>His disciples went down to the sea</b><br>The disciples' movement "down to the sea" refers to the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in northern Israel. This body of water is central to many of Jesus' miracles and teachings. The Sea of Galilee is situated below the surrounding hills, which explains the phrase "went down." This geographical detail underscores the disciples' familiarity with the area, as many of them were fishermen by trade. The sea is a place of both livelihood and testing for the disciples, as seen in various Gospel accounts. This setting also foreshadows the upcoming miracle of Jesus walking on water, demonstrating His authority over nature and His divine identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who were learning from Him and witnessing His miracles.
