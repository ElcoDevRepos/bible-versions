The context is His encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well, which occurs in the region of Samaria. This interaction is significant because Jews typically avoided Samaritans due to longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Jesus' willingness to engage with the Samaritans demonstrates His mission to reach all people, transcending cultural barriers. The phrase indicates a direct communication from Jesus, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader.<p><b>&#8220;I have food to eat</b><br>Here, Jesus uses the metaphor of food to convey a spiritual truth. In the Bible, food often symbolizes sustenance and satisfaction. Jesus is referring to a type of nourishment that goes beyond physical sustenance. This aligns with other scriptural references where spiritual fulfillment is likened to food, such as in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, where Jesus says, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." The "food" Jesus speaks of is His commitment to doing the will of the Father, which provides Him with spiritual strength and satisfaction.<p><b>that you know nothing about.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the disciples' lack of understanding regarding spiritual matters at this point in their journey with Jesus. It underscores a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' followers often misunderstand His teachings, which are frequently spiritual in nature rather than literal. This statement invites the disciples to seek deeper understanding and insight into Jesus' mission and the nature of His kingdom. It also foreshadows the greater revelation and comprehension they will gain after the resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is speaking to His disciples after His encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are concerned about His physical nourishment and are puzzled by His statement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritan_woman.htm">Samaritan Woman</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, her encounter with Jesus sets the context for this teaching moment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sychar.htm">Sychar</a></b><br>The town in Samaria where this event takes place, near Jacob's well.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_well.htm">Jacob's Well</a></b><br>A significant historical and spiritual site where Jesus speaks to the Samaritan woman and later to His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment_over_physical_needs.htm">Spiritual Nourishment Over Physical Needs</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of spiritual sustenance over physical food.

When they returned and urged Him to eat (<a href="/john/4-31.htm">John 4:31</a>), He redirected the conversation.<p>&#8226; By saying &#8220;He told them,&#8221; Scripture highlights that the disciples needed teaching in that moment&#8212;much like in <a href="/matthew/16-11.htm">Matthew 16:11&#8211;12</a>, when Jesus corrected their misunderstanding about bread.<p>&#8226; Christ often seized ordinary moments to reveal spiritual truth (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38&#8211;42</a>; <a href="/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14&#8211;21</a>). Here, their concern for lunch became a doorway to a lesson on divine priorities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have food to eat</b><p>Jesus pointed to a sustenance beyond the physical.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a> He quoted, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God,&#8221; showing that spiritual nourishment sustains more deeply than any meal.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;food&#8221; was doing the Father&#8217;s will; this is stated plainly a few verses later: &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience and mission energized Jesus. Similarly, when believers walk in God&#8217;s purposes, they experience strength and satisfaction (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you know nothing about</b><p>The disciples, focused on groceries, missed the spiritual dimension unfolding before them.<p>&#8226; Earlier they had marveled that He spoke with a woman (<a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>); now they marvel again, revealing limited understanding (compare <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus was not rebuking them harshly but inviting them to a deeper awareness (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Soon they would taste this &#8220;food&#8221; themselves, laboring in a harvest they had not planted (<a href="/john/4-38.htm">John 4:38</a>) and discovering the joy of gospel work (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/4-32.htm">John 4:32</a> reveals that Jesus draws life from accomplishing the Father&#8217;s will.

"Meat" is better rendered <span class= "ital">food</span> (see Note on <a href="/john/4-8.htm" title="(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)">John 4:8</a>). The Greek word here is the same as in <a href="/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>; <a href="/john/6-55.htm" title="For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.">John 6:55</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he saith to them, I have food to eat that ye know not;</span> of which you are ignorant, but which you may come to know by and by. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are both used. The first denotes, strictly speaking, the act of eating; and the second the material for food; but they are, in Greek literature, generally used almost interchangeably. There were Divine desires and sacred satisfactions which discriminated the Lord's consciousness from that of his disciples. Thoma refers to the mighty fasts of the great lawgiver and prophet as the literary antecedent of this significant event; but this superiority to food is true of every great soul. The men of the spirit are consumed with desires which dwarf the desires of the flesh, and they forget to eat their bread. Nor can we forget that the synoptic narrative places the forty dave' fast in this very epoch of Christ's life, chronologically speaking.
