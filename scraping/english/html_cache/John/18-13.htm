Although he was no longer the official high priest, he retained considerable influence, as seen in his involvement in Jesus' trial. The high priesthood was a lifetime position according to Jewish law, but Roman authorities often replaced high priests to maintain control. Annas' continued influence is evident as he was the first to whom Jesus was taken, indicating his authority and respect within the Jewish leadership. This act fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus being rejected by the religious leaders (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>).<p><b>who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas</b><br>Caiaphas, the son-in-law of Annas, was the acting high priest at the time of Jesus' trial. This familial connection highlights the dynastic nature of the high priesthood during this period, with Annas' family maintaining control over the position. Caiaphas' role in the trial of Jesus is significant, as he was instrumental in orchestrating the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion. This connection between Annas and Caiaphas underscores the political and religious complexities of the time, as well as the collusion between different factions to maintain power.<p><b>the high priest that year</b><br>Caiaphas served as high priest from AD 18 to 36, a notably long tenure, suggesting his adeptness at navigating the political landscape under Roman rule. The phrase "that year" emphasizes the specific time of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, a pivotal moment in salvation history. The high priest's role was central in Jewish worship, especially during the Day of Atonement, making Caiaphas' involvement in Jesus' condemnation deeply ironic, as Jesus is the ultimate High Priest and the final atoning sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). This highlights the transition from the old covenant to the new covenant through Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being led to trial and crucifixion.
