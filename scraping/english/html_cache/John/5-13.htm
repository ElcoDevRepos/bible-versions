His lack of knowledge about Jesus highlights the anonymity with which Jesus often performed miracles, emphasizing His humility and the focus on faith rather than fame. This incident reflects the broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus' identity is gradually revealed, often misunderstood or unrecognized by those He helps. The man's ignorance of Jesus' identity also underscores the grace of God, who acts even when we are unaware of His presence.<p><b>for Jesus had slipped away</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' intentional withdrawal from the scene, a common occurrence in His ministry. Jesus often avoided public acclaim and potential conflict with religious authorities, as His time had not yet come. This action reflects His strategic approach to ministry, balancing public teaching and private retreat. It also demonstrates His control over the situation, ensuring that His mission proceeded according to divine timing rather than human expectation.<p><b>while the crowd was there</b><br>The presence of a crowd at the Pool of Bethesda suggests a bustling environment, typical of Jerusalem, especially during feast times. Crowds often gathered around Jesus, drawn by His teachings and miracles. However, the crowd's presence also posed a risk of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of His mission, as many sought a political Messiah rather than a spiritual Savior. This setting underscores the tension between Jesus' growing popularity and the need for discretion in His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healed_man.htm">The Healed Man</a></b><br>A man who had been an invalid for 38 years, healed by Jesus at the Pool of Bethesda.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The Son of God, who performs the miracle of healing the invalid.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pool_of_bethesda.htm">The Pool of Bethesda</a></b><br>A pool in Jerusalem where many disabled people lay, hoping for healing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people present at the Pool of Bethesda, witnessing the events but unaware of Jesus' identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, they later question the healed man about his healing on the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unseen_healer.htm">The Unseen Healer</a></b><br>Jesus often works in ways that are not immediately recognized.
