In Jewish burial customs, bodies were often placed in caves or carved tombs sealed with a large stone. The act of removing the stone signifies an act of faith and obedience to Jesus' command, despite the potential for decay and odor after four days. This moment foreshadows the resurrection of Jesus, where a stone is also rolled away from His tomb. It highlights the power of Jesus over death and the grave, a central theme in the Gospel of John.<p><b>Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward</b><br>Lifting one's eyes to heaven is a common posture of prayer in Jewish tradition, symbolizing a direct communication with God. This gesture indicates Jesus' intimate relationship with the Father and His reliance on divine authority. It also serves as a public demonstration of His connection to God, reinforcing His identity as the Son of God. This act of looking upward is seen in other biblical instances, such as in <a href="/psalms/123.htm">Psalm 123:1</a>, where the psalmist lifts their eyes to God in heaven.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</b><br>Jesus addresses God as "Father," emphasizing the personal and familial relationship between them. This term reflects the unique sonship of Jesus and His role in the divine plan. The expression of gratitude before the miracle occurs demonstrates Jesus' confidence in the Father's will and power. It also serves as a model of faith and thanksgiving for believers, showing that prayer is not just about requests but also about acknowledging God's faithfulness. This moment connects to other instances where Jesus thanks God, such as in the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11</a>), illustrating a consistent pattern of gratitude in His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority and intimate relationship with the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lazarus.htm">Lazarus</a></b><br>The brother of Mary and Martha, whose death and subsequent resurrection by Jesus is the focal event of <a href="/bsb/john/11.htm">John 11</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_and_martha.htm">Mary and Martha</a></b><br>Sisters of Lazarus, who are mourning his death and are witnesses to Jesus' miracle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The village where Lazarus, Mary, and Martha lived, located near Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>The physical barrier to Lazarus' tomb, symbolizing the removal of obstacles to divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_in_prayer.htm">Gratitude in Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus models the importance of thanking God even before the miracle occurs, teaching us to trust in God's faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Removing the stone was an act of faith, showing that human cooperation is often required in divine works.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_relationship.htm">Divine Relationship</a></b><br>Jesus' address to the Father highlights the intimate relationship believers are invited into through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_witness.htm">Public Witness</a></b><br>Jesus' public prayer serves as a testimony to those around Him, encouraging believers to live out their faith openly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_god's_will.htm">Confidence in God's Will</a></b><br>Jesus' assurance that the Father hears Him encourages believers to pray with confidence in God's responsiveness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_11_41_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 11:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_John_11_41_guide_our_prayers.htm">How does Jesus' gratitude in John 11:41 model our prayer life today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_relationship_with_God_in_John_11_41.htm">What does Jesus' prayer in John 11:41 reveal about His relationship with God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_thankfulness_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' example of thankfulness in our daily challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_John_11_41_Phil_4_6_on_prayer.htm">How does John 11:41 connect with Philippians 4:6 on prayer and thanksgiving?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_Jesus_prayer_for_Lazarus.htm">What role does faith play in Jesus' prayer before Lazarus' resurrection in John 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_thank_God_before_miracle_in_John_11_41.htm">Why did Jesus thank God before performing the miracle in John 11:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_11_41_Jesus_bond_with_God.htm">How does John 11:41 demonstrate Jesus' relationship with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_lift_His_eyes_in_John_11_41.htm">What is the significance of Jesus lifting His eyes in John 11:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_pro-palestinian_movement.htm">Who knows the Son except the Father?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_praying_out_loud_necessary.htm">Is praying out loud necessary?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_did_jesus_mean_by_'i_am'.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'Before Abraham was, I am'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_private_vs._public_prayer.htm">Matthew 6:5&#8211;6: If praying in private is commanded, how do we reconcile public prayers in church or corporate worship? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does John 11:41 Mean</div><b>So they took away the stone</b><p>&#8226; This action displays obedient faith by Martha and the mourners.

The verse which follows was spoken to prevent a misunderstanding on the part of the disciples and in all times.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Then they took away the stone [ from the place where the dead was laid]. They lifted the stone, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesus lifted up his eyes</span> <span class="accented">to heaven</span>. This is not to be taken as an ordinary prayer, but a thanksgiving for prayer already heard. "Jesus lifted up his eyes," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to heaven - to that sublime symbol of the infinite activity of God, which surrounds us day and night, and which is in numerous religious systems made a type and image of the Divine Being himself; nor does our modern conception of the universe dethrone it from this high place. Christ's language is thanksgiving that God has already heard him. Godet and Hengstenberg say that Jesus thanked God in anticipation of the miracle, as though it were already done. Meyer and Alford look back to some earlier prayers. But surely there is some reason for the thanksgiving. The stone is <span class="accented">lifted</span>, or <span class="accented">removed</span>; there lies the corpse, but no dank sepulchral vapor issues from it; rather some sign is given that prayer offered by Christ had been already heard, and that death has not made the havoc with the frame which would otherwise have occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me</span>. When he uttered the prayer we cannot say; but we know that his mind was greatly exercised concerning his friend before he left Peraea. His words confess that his wishes have been in harmony with the Divine eternal will. So elsewhere the Lord tells his disciples, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "your desires will be in harmony with the Divine purpose; you will not be able to pray for anything either temporal or spiritual which God will not bestow, has not indeed prepared himself to bestow and you to receive." This is the true mystery and meaning of prayer. The hypothesis of the twofold nature of Christ, instead of being shipwrecked on the fact of his prayers and intercessions, throws light on the very nature of prayer itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/11-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
