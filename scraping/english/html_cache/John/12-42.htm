The term "leaders" likely refers to members of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council of the Jews, which included Pharisees and Sadducees. Despite their positions, some were convinced by Jesus' teachings and miracles. This belief among the leaders fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, which speaks of the arm of the Lord being revealed, indicating that even those in authority would recognize the Messiah. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea are examples of such leaders who believed in Jesus (<a href="/john/3.htm">John 3:1-2</a>, <a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-39</a>).<p><b>But because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him,</b><br>The Pharisees were a powerful religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. Their influence was significant in the synagogues and among the people. The leaders' fear of the Pharisees indicates the social and religious pressure to conform to established norms. Confession of faith in Jesus would have been seen as a direct challenge to the Pharisaic authority and interpretation of the Law. This reluctance to confess publicly is reminiscent of the fear of man described in <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>, which contrasts with the call to boldness in faith found in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>.<p><b>for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.</b><br>Being put out of the synagogue was a severe consequence, as the synagogue was central to Jewish religious, social, and community life. This expulsion, known as "herem," meant exclusion from the religious community and social ostracism. <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> provides a similar context where the parents of the man born blind feared the Jewish leaders for the same reason. This fear reflects the cost of discipleship and the challenge of prioritizing allegiance to Christ over societal acceptance, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32-33</a>. The synagogue's role as a community hub underscores the significant sacrifice involved in openly following Jesus during this period.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders.htm">Leaders</a></b><br>Refers to the Jewish authorities or rulers who believed in Jesus but were hesitant to publicly confess their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A prominent religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Yes&#8212;many did.<p>&#8226; Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>; 7:50) and Joseph of Arimathea (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>) stand as personal examples, showing that high rank does not immunize a person from the Spirit&#8217;s conviction.<p>&#8226; Their belief underscores <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>: &#8220;to all who did receive Him&#8230;He gave the right to become children of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him,</b><p>Belief stayed hidden.

The choice is stark: silence to please men or confession to honor God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a> links confession with salvation&#8217;s fullness: &#8220;If you confess with your mouth, &#8216;Jesus is Lord,&#8217; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The leaders&#8217; silence illustrates the tug-of-war between conviction and convenience, reminding us that secret faith longs for courageous expression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.</b><p>The synagogue was the social, religious, and economic hub of Jewish life. Expulsion meant isolation, lost livelihood, and family shame.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a> forewarns, &#8220;They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Fear of man can smother fruitful faith (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>). Yet God calls His people to value eternal fellowship over temporal acceptance (<a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, costly identification with God&#8217;s people is honored: consider Moses who &#8220;chose to suffer affliction with the people of God&#8221; rather than enjoy Egypt&#8217;s pleasures (<a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast sharpens the glory of later believers who, having &#8220;rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>), embraced public discipleship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/12-42.htm">John 12:42</a> reveals that genuine faith can sprout even in intimidating environments, yet fear of rejection can muzzle it.

It seems from the present passage that the Pharisees were the most determined foes of Christ, and that even the rulers were kept in awe by their threat of excommunication. This submission to the Pharisees' yoke which kept them from Christ was itself blinding their eyes and hardening their hearts. They are at once, therefore, the exception to, and the illustration of, the principle of which St. John was speaking. They had the power to see the truth, but they had not the will to face boldly the results of their own convictions, and the unused power ceased to exist.
