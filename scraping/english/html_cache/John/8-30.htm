In <a href="/john/8.htm">John 8</a>, Jesus is engaged in a dialogue with the Pharisees and the Jewish crowd, discussing His identity and mission. The "things" He spoke include His claims of being the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and His relationship with the Father (<a href="/john/8-16.htm">John 8:16-18</a>). This context is crucial as it highlights the authority and divine nature of Jesus' words, which were often met with skepticism and hostility from the religious leaders. The setting is likely the temple courts in Jerusalem, a central place for teaching and debate, especially during the Feast of Tabernacles, which provides a backdrop for the events in <a href="/john/7.htm">John 7 and 8</a>.<p><b>many believed in Him</b><br>This phrase indicates a significant response to Jesus' message. The belief mentioned here is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John, emphasizing faith as a response to Jesus' revelation of Himself. The term "believed" suggests more than intellectual assent; it implies trust and acceptance of Jesus' claims. This belief is contrasted with the unbelief of the Pharisees and other leaders, who often rejected Jesus despite witnessing His miracles and hearing His teachings. The response of "many" highlights the impact of Jesus' words and the division He caused among the people. This belief is a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, which speaks of the report being believed by some, and it foreshadows the spread of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community to the Gentiles, as seen in the book of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching in the temple courts, addressing the crowd and the Pharisees.

There is surely no less room for wonder in the faith spoken of here. Those who believe are of the rulers ("those Jews," <a href="/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>). The words which they now heard (<a href="/context/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28-29</a>) contain nothing of what we commonly call proof. They are an appeal to the future which should prove them true, and to His own consciousness of perfect obedience to the Father's will, and of unbroken realisation of the Father's presence. They are indeed, in part, words which men have since dwelt upon to prove that He who uttered them did not claim to be divine. It was not so with those who heard Him. They are watching for a technical assertion of His divinity, and do not hear it; but they are convinced by the power of His words that He is divine. (Comp. Note on <a href="/john/7-31.htm" title="And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?">John 7:31</a>.) These scribes and Pharisees feel, as their officers felt before, that "Never man spake like this Man." Where was priest or Rabbi who could appeal to the spotless purity of a life? There is the irresistible power of truth in the appeal which carries conviction to the heart. We have already found in the case of Nicodemus an example, probably not a solitary one, of a faith among the rulers which dared not confess itself. (See also <a href="/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</span> This is another interjected comment or connecting link supplied by the evangelist, revealing intimate knowledge of the state of feeling and changeful emotions of the people. Another hint of the eyewitness and ear witness of this memorable scene; and, supposing that we read here a correct transcript of words that proceeded from his lips, we can do no other than cry with Thomas, "My Lord, and my God!" The remark is intercalated, as though St. John wished to emphasize the accuracy with which he had reported, on this occasion, the very words of his Lord, conveying their ambiguous phrase, and asserting in fresh form what had convinced St. John, on subsequent reflection, that he was what he said. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, to believe <span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">on</span>, a person, is to close with him, to accept all the collateral consequences of such trust, to be content to wait for fuller explanation, to cast self upon the object of faith, and allow the object of such trust to bear all the responsibility of the act. It is the form most frequently adopted by St. John (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16, 18, 36</a>; <a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39</a>, and many other places; cf. <a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1, 12</a>; <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20</a>); only once in the synoptic narrative (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> with <a href="/mark/9-42.htm">Mark 9:42</a>). The form <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> occurs occasionally with the accusative (<a href="/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a>, and frequently in the Acts); and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with the dative, also! <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, are used, implying even a closer and more intimate communion still with the Object of faith (see <a href="/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30</a>). With these forms must be compared the more common one with the simple dative, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>, which occurs in vers. 31, 45, and <a href="/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>, etc., which implies acceptance of the saying, promise, or fact there propounded, and falls short of the moral surrender involved in the fuller form. John here asserts that <span class="accented">many</span> of his hearers, those who had hitherto refrained from full acceptance of Jesus as the Son of God, yielded to his claims there and then. This faith on the part of "some" is almost more wonderful than the unbelief of others. The difficulties in their way were appalling in comparison with the perplexities which beset our minds. The Lord appealed to his own inner consciousness, to his supernatural aid in speech, to the spotless, sinless character of his hidden life. It was remarkable that any strangers or enemies should have surrendered themselves to them. The event shows that the surrender could not stand the test. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As [Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
