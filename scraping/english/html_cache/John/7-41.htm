The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," meaning "Anointed One." In the Jewish context, the Messiah was expected to be a deliverer and king, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The declaration by some that Jesus is the Christ indicates their belief that He fulfills these messianic prophecies. This belief is supported by Jesus' teachings, miracles, and authority, which align with the expectations of the Messiah as a spiritual and, for some, a political leader.<p><b>But still others asked, &#8220;How can the Christ come from Galilee?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the skepticism and misunderstanding about Jesus' origins. Galilee was a region in northern Israel, often looked down upon by Judeans for its mixed population and distance from the religious center of Jerusalem. The question reflects a common belief that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem, as prophesied in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which states that the ruler of Israel would come from Bethlehem, the city of David. This skepticism is rooted in a lack of knowledge about Jesus' birth in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>) and His Davidic lineage (<a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>). The question also underscores the theme of Jesus being a stumbling block to those who rely solely on human understanding and preconceived notions, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose identity as the Messiah is being debated.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A diverse group of people in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles, expressing differing opinions about Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel, known for being less prestigious than Judea, and the place where Jesus grew up.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast_of_tabernacles.htm">The Feast of Tabernacles</a></b><br>A Jewish festival during which this debate takes place, highlighting the significance of Jesus' presence in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messiah.htm">The Messiah (Christ)</a></b><br>The anointed one expected by the Jews, whose origins and identity are being questioned.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of knowing the full context of biblical prophecies to avoid misunderstandings about Jesus' identity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judging_by_appearances.htm">Judging by Appearances</a></b><br>Be cautious of making judgments based on preconceived notions or external appearances, as the crowd did with Jesus' Galilean origin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_truth.htm">Seeking Truth</a></b><br>Encourage a diligent search for truth, as the crowd's debate shows the necessity of seeking deeper understanding of Jesus' life and mission.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>Acknowledge that differing opinions exist within the body of believers, and strive for unity by focusing on the core truths of the faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Reflect on personal biases that may hinder recognizing God's work in unexpected places or people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_John_7_41_mean.htm">What is the meaning of John 7:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/John_7_41_Recognize_Jesus_identity.htm">How does John 7:41 challenge us to recognize Jesus' true identity today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/OT_prophecies_Jesus_Messiah_Bethlehem.htm">What Old Testament prophecies affirm Jesus as the Messiah from Bethlehem?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Address_Jesus_origins_in_faith_talks.htm">How can we address doubts about Jesus' origins in our faith discussions?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jesus_birthplace_key_to_faith.htm">Why is understanding Jesus' birthplace important for our faith in Him?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/John_7_41_Seek_deeper_truth_in_Scripture.htm">How does John 7:41 encourage us to study Scripture for deeper truth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_doubt_Jesus_as_Messiah_in_John_7_41.htm">Why did some people doubt Jesus as the Messiah in John 7:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/John_7_41_Jesus_origin_questioned.htm">How does John 7:41 challenge the understanding of Jesus' origin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_fuels_doubt_in_John_7_41.htm">What historical context influences the skepticism in John 7:41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_john_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from John 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_question_messiah's_galilee_origin.htm">John 7:41&#8211;42 &#8211; Why do some question the Messiah&#8217;s origin in Galilee if Scripture says the Messiah must come from Bethlehem? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_was_jesus'_place_of_residence.htm">What was Jesus' place of residence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_peter_learn_jesus_is_the_christ.htm">How did Simon Peter find out that Jesus was the Christ?

These signs matched Old Testament expectations for the promised Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Some listeners, seeing and hearing these things firsthand, drew the straightforward conclusion: Jesus is the long-awaited &#8220;Anointed One&#8221; foretold from <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> onward and promised explicitly in passages such as <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a> and <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>.<p>&#8226; Their declaration aligns with earlier confessions: the Samaritan villagers who said, &#8220;We know that this man really is the Savior of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-42.htm">John 4:42</a>), and Peter&#8217;s confession, &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture openly invites this conclusion. John will later state his purpose: &#8220;that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But still others asked, &#8220;How can the Christ come from Galilee?&#8221;</b><p><a href="/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a> b continues: &#8220;But still others asked, &#8216;How can the Christ come from Galilee?&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The objection rests on an incomplete grasp of prophecy and of Jesus&#8217; own background. <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> foretells that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem of Judah. The crowd knows this (<a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>) but mistakenly thinks Jesus originates in Galilee alone.<p>&#8226; In truth, Jesus was born in Bethlehem (<a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4-7</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1-6</a>) and is of David&#8217;s royal line (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23-31</a>; <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>). He later grew up in Nazareth of Galilee (<a href="/matthew/2-22.htm">Matthew 2:22-23</a>), fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which foretold light dawning on &#8220;Galilee of the nations.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their question illustrates how assumptions can cloud recognition of God&#8217;s work. The same Scriptures that pointed to Bethlehem also predicted a ministry centered in Galilee (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>). Jesus meets both qualifications perfectly.<p>&#8226; Division over Jesus is a recurring theme: some respond in faith, others stumble over preconceived notions (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>; 7:12; 10:19-21). Yet the evidence for His messiahship remains consistent and compelling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a> captures a moment of sharp division. One group rightly identifies Jesus as the Christ based on His words and works; another hesitates because they think the Messiah cannot come from Galilee. The hesitation rests on incomplete information, for Jesus was indeed born in Bethlehem and ministered in Galilee, fulfilling all prophetic requirements. Scripture consistently affirms that He is the promised Messiah, and the passage invites today&#8217;s reader to trust that testimony without reservation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Others said this is the Christ.</span>--The Messiah is distinguished from the Prophet in the words of the multitude there, as in the question of the legates of the Sanhedrin, <a href="/context/john/1-20.htm" title="And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.">John 1:20-21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span>--The answer "No" is expected, and the tense is present--<span class= "ital">Surely the Messiah cometh not out of Galilee?</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Others said, This is the Christ.</span> These must have pressed the argument further.

Was he not called "Jesus of Nazareth"? His life had been spent there, his ministry in the main restricted to the northern province. These questions give a vivid scene and portray a great emotion. The people are resting on the letter of prophecy (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), where the Messiah, as understood by their own teachers (see <a href="/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5</a>), was to proceed from Bethlehem; but they overlook the remarkable prediction in <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>, where Galilee is spoken of as the scene of extraordinary illumination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/7-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Others</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7948;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Alloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_243.htm">Strong's 243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Other, another (of more than two), different.
