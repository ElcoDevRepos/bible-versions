His arrival "just after him" refers to John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, who reached the tomb first but did not enter. This moment highlights Peter's leadership role among the disciples, as he takes the initiative to enter the tomb. The urgency and immediacy of Peter's actions reflect the deep concern and confusion among the disciples following the crucifixion and reports of the empty tomb. This scene is set in the context of the resurrection morning, a pivotal event in Christian theology, affirming Jesus' victory over death.<p><b>He entered the tomb</b><br>Peter's decision to enter the tomb demonstrates his courage and desire for understanding. The tomb, likely a rock-cut structure typical of first-century Jewish burial practices, was located in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Entering the tomb signifies a willingness to confront the reality of Jesus' death and the mystery of His resurrection. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' earlier prediction that Peter would be a foundational leader in the early church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>).<p><b>and saw the linen cloths lying there.</b><br>The presence of the linen cloths is significant. In Jewish burial customs, the body would be wrapped in linen with spices. The fact that the cloths were lying there, and not in disarray, suggests that Jesus' body was not stolen, as grave robbers would not have taken the time to unwrap the body. This detail supports the resurrection narrative, as it implies a supernatural event. The linen cloths lying undisturbed can be seen as a symbol of Jesus' resurrection, echoing the imagery of the grave clothes left behind as a sign of new life, similar to Lazarus being unbound from his grave clothes (<a href="/john/11-44.htm">John 11:44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong leadership among the apostles.

Peter&#8217;s arrival just moments later shows his characteristic boldness and urgency, matching his earlier resolve to follow Jesus even in danger (<a href="/luke/22-33.htm">Luke 22:33</a>).<p>&#8226; This small time gap highlights their differing temperaments: John&#8217;s reflective caution contrasts with Peter&#8217;s impulsive action, yet both are drawn by love and curiosity. The scene echoes <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>&#8212;believers strengthen one another through their unique gifts.<p>&#8226; The fact that two eyewitnesses arrive independently fulfills the principle of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a> that testimony is confirmed by &#8220;two or three witnesses,&#8221; preparing the ground for credible resurrection evidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He entered the tomb</b><p>&#8220;He entered the tomb.&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6</a>b)<p>&#8226; Peter&#8217;s entry fulfills his role as the outspoken leader of the Twelve (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-19</a>). His stepping inside emphasizes courageous investigation rather than passive observation, an attitude urged in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;Test all things; hold fast to what is good.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This action demonstrates that faith and inquiry work hand in hand.

This detail rules out grave robbery, since thieves would not unwrap a corpse before fleeing (<a href="/john/19-40.htm">John 19:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The orderly state of the linens, paired with the separate placement of the face cloth described in verse 7, points to a deliberate, supernatural departure, aligning with Jesus&#8217; own words in <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.&#8221;<p>&#8226; These linens become silent witnesses, much like the stones Joshua set up at the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6-7</a>); they provoke remembrance and testimony of God&#8217;s power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6</a> captures Peter&#8217;s urgent arrival, bold entrance, and careful observation.

Peter&#8217;s actions invite believers today to combine zeal with thoughtful examination, anchoring faith in the concrete reality of Christ&#8217;s victory over death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie.</span>--Better, . . . <span class= "ital">beholdeth the linen clothes lie.</span> The word is not the same as that in <a href="/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5</a>, but expresses the close observation of the linen clothes by St. Peter, while St. John did but see them from without.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - John stood gazing, waiting, wondering, and, while doing this, <span class="cmt_word">then cometh Simon Peter following him</span> across the very garden which must have borne many marks of the dreadful tragedy that had been hurriedly terminated before the commencement of the sabbath. The expression, "following him," may refer to what Luke (<a href="/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>) says that Peter did, viz. that he too stooped down and looked as John had done. Westcott says, "without a look or pause." But why need we suppose a point-blank contradiction of Luke? Such a mode of entrance is almost unthinkable. But he did more: <span class="cmt_word">And entered into the sepulcher</span>. How strangely impulsive this man! how characteristic of every other recorded action of Peter! There must have been a Peter who corresponded to the four- or five-fold portraiture of the evangelistic history. The last time that Peter saw his Lord was when a "look" of his cruelly insulted Friend and Master had broken his own heart; yet now he was rushing impulsively to gaze again upon that face with, so far as he knew, all the marks of infernal insult yet upon it. The contrast of character between John and Peter is everywhere maintained. John, in <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, first recognizes the Lord; Peter hurries through the waters to fall once more at his feet. John is lost in silent meditations; Peter exclaims, and wonders. <span class="cmt_word">And he beholdeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, with a closer and more careful, vivid, and instructive gaze, not merely <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, the word used by John of his own conduct) <span class="cmt_word">the linen cloths lying, and the napkin</span> (sudarium, schweisstueh) <span class="cmt_word">which was</span> (had been) <span class="cmt_word">upon his head</span>.

How full the writer's mind was of Christ! <span class="cmt_word">Not lying with the linen cloths, but separately in one place, rolled up,</span> as if it had been folded up or wrapped together (see for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, AEschylus, 'Again.,' 623; Homer, 'Iliad,' <span class="greek">&#x3b7;</span>. 470 - this is the only time that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is thus adverbially used in the New Testament - and see for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, present participle, <a href="/luke/23-53.htm">Luke 23:53</a>). It was clear, then, that the body had not been carried away for another burial, nor had it been hastily removed, seeing that there were signs of deliberation, choice, and care. All that was suggested by this wonderful appearance of the grave, all that it means to us, we cannot fathom. The new life has raiment of its own, belonging to a higher region of existence, woven in spiritual looms; yet the hands that unwound these bandages and head-cloth, and laid them as Peter and John saw them, were capable of physical exertions and activity. What dogmatic hints are involved in this recital! He is a living Person, not an abstract principle or vague force. There are evident proofs that, however great the change which had passed over him, the Living One was the same man that he had ever been. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Simon</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#943;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Sim&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4613.htm">Strong's 4613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simon.
