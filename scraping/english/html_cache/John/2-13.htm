It is a time of remembrance and celebration, marked by the sacrifice of a lamb and the eating of unleavened bread. The Passover is a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), symbolizing His sacrificial death for the redemption of humanity. The timing of this event is significant, as it sets the stage for Jesus' later crucifixion, which occurs during Passover, highlighting the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and typology.<p><b>Jesus went up to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem is the central city of Jewish worship, home to the Temple, which is the focal point of religious life and the location where sacrifices are offered. The phrase "went up" is used because Jerusalem is situated on a hill, and pilgrims would ascend to the city. This journey to Jerusalem for the Passover was a customary practice for Jewish males, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>. Jesus' presence in Jerusalem during Passover is significant, as it demonstrates His adherence to Jewish law and customs, and it foreshadows His ultimate sacrifice. This visit also sets the stage for His public ministry and the events leading to His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to perform significant actions in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_passover.htm">Jewish Passover</a></b><br>A major Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, symbolizing liberation and redemption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city, central to Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, where significant events in Jesus' ministry occur.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_significance_of_passover.htm">Understanding the Significance of Passover</a></b><br>The Passover is a time of remembrance and reflection on God's deliverance.

Nothing in Jesus&#8217; ministry happens haphazardly. &#8220;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). John repeatedly marks the calendar of Jesus&#8217; life (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>; 13:1), underscoring that every event unfolds right on schedule.<p>&#8226; The moment recorded here is a hinge between the private sign at Cana (<a href="/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1-11</a>) and a very public confrontation in the temple courts. We are invited to watch how divine purpose intersects ordinary dates on a calendar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jewish Passover</b><p>&#8226; Passover is the memorial of Israel&#8217;s rescue from Egypt (<a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>). Three times a year males were commanded to appear before the LORD in the place He chose (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; John purposely calls it &#8220;the Jewish Passover,&#8221; pointing readers beyond national ritual to its ultimate fulfillment. Paul later writes, &#8220;For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). From the first chapter, John has already identified Jesus as &#8220;the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p>&#8226; By tying Jesus to this festival, Scripture links the Exodus deliverance to the greater deliverance Jesus will accomplish at the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was near</b><p>&#8226; The nearness of the feast heightens expectation. Crowds surge toward Jerusalem; hearts are tuned to remember redemption. That charged atmosphere sets the stage for Jesus&#8217; dramatic cleansing of the temple (<a href="/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; John later notes two additional times when &#8220;the Passover was near&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>; 11:55), each one advancing the story toward the climactic Passover in which Jesus Himself will die. God lets us feel the countdown.<p>&#8226; Nearness reminds us that opportunities to meet with God arrive, then pass. <a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a> urges, &#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus</b><p>&#8226; The focus instantly shifts from the feast to its true fulfillment&#8212;Jesus. &#8220;In Him all the fullness of Deity dwells bodily&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; He is not merely a participant; He is the Lord of the feast. Just as He turned water into wine, He will soon redefine Passover bread and cup (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; His presence confronts stale religion. Whenever Jesus enters a scene, revelation follows (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and authority is exercised (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went up</b><p>&#8226; Pilgrims always spoke of &#8220;going up&#8221; to the holy city, both geographically and spiritually (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; consistent obedience to the Law is on display. From childhood He traveled to Jerusalem for the feasts (<a href="/luke/2-41.htm">Luke 2:41-42</a>). He fulfills every righteous requirement (<a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at purposeful ascent toward His ultimate mission. Each step is a step toward the cross (<a href="/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem is the city God chose &#8220;that My Name might be there&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). Prophets called it the place of God&#8217;s throne and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; It is here that prophecy, sacrifice, and kingdom converge. Jesus will teach, heal, clash with authorities, die, rise, and ascend from this city. <a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a> captures His heart: &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem&#8230; how often I have longed to gather your children together.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ultimately the earthly city points forward to &#8220;the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), secured by the Lamb who now walks its streets in <a href="/bsb/john/2.htm">John 2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a> plants a simple travel note that opens a panoramic window on God&#8217;s redemptive plan. At precisely the right moment, near the feast that celebrates deliverance, Jesus&#8212;fully obedient Son and true Passover Lamb&#8212;ascends to the city chosen for sacrifice and glory. Every detail affirms Scripture&#8217;s accuracy: time, festival, Person, movement, and place all align to reveal the Savior who fulfills Law, prophecy, and promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/john/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And the Jews' passover was at hand.</span>--Here, again, we are on common ground with the earlier Gospels. They place a cleansing of the Temple at the close of our Lord's ministry at the only Passover which comes within the scope of their narrative. The subject has been dealt with in Notes on <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> (Comp. also <span class= "ital">Introduction: The Chronological Harmony of the Gospels,</span> p. 35) The careful reader will not fail to observe the graphic touches peculiar to this narrative--the money-changers <span class= "ital">sitting,</span> the sacrificial animals, the making of the scourge, the money poured out, the order to remove the doves which could not be driven out. We feel all through in the presence of an eye-witness. It is worth remembering that on the eve of the Passover the head of every family carefully collected all the leaven in the house, and there was a general cleansing. He was doing in His Father's house, it may be, what was then being done in every house in Jerusalem. The remark will be seen to have an important bearing on the question of the repetition of the cleansing.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
