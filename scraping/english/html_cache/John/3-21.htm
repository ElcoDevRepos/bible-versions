In the biblical context, "truth" is often associated with God's Word and His commandments (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>). Practicing the truth involves aligning one's actions with the teachings of Jesus, who is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This concept is rooted in the Hebrew understanding of truth as faithfulness and reliability, suggesting a life of integrity and obedience to God's will.<p><b>comes into the Light</b><br>The "Light" symbolizes Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). Coming into the Light implies a willingness to be exposed to the truth of Christ and to live transparently before God and others. This imagery of light versus darkness is prevalent throughout Scripture, representing the contrast between good and evil, knowledge and ignorance, salvation and condemnation (<a href="/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8-14</a>). The act of coming into the Light signifies repentance and a desire for spiritual transformation.<p><b>so that it may be seen clearly</b><br>This phrase suggests that the actions of those who practice the truth are meant to be visible and evident to others. It reflects the biblical principle that believers are to be "the light of the world" (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>), demonstrating their faith through good works. The visibility of one's deeds serves as a testimony to the transformative power of God's truth in a believer's life, encouraging others to glorify God.<p><b>that what he has done has been accomplished in God.</b><br>This final phrase acknowledges that any good deeds or righteous living are ultimately the result of God's work in an individual's life. It underscores the doctrine of divine grace, where human efforts are empowered and sustained by God's Spirit (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>). This aligns with the teaching that believers are created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). The phrase also highlights the importance of giving glory to God for any accomplishments, recognizing His sovereignty and providence in all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is having a conversation with Nicodemus, a Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council, about spiritual rebirth and the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nicodemus.htm">Nicodemus</a></b><br>A Pharisee who comes to Jesus at night seeking understanding about His teachings.

With fixed purpose he doeth not that which is evil or worthless, but that which, when every veil by which it is hidden from himself or others is removed, remains morally true. Regarding truth as the work of life, he cometh to the light, and though for him too it will be a revelation of sins and errors, and deeds of shame, he hates them the moment he knows them, cuts them from his life at whatever cost, and carries his whole being to the light that it may become really true, and that its true works may be made manifest. He will hate the darkness, for he can have nothing to conceal in it. He will love the light, for everything which it reproves he reproves too, and every ray he can gather from it becomes part of the truth which is his life-work. For the remarkable expression "to do the truth," which, with its opposite "to do a lie" (<a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.

This is confirmed by St. Paul's argument (<a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a> and 2), where some Gentiles who have not the Law are admitted to do by nature the things contained in the Law, and even to become a law unto themselves; and where, in contradistinction to the hopelessly rebellious, Paul assumes that there are some who "by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, honour, and immortality." These "do the truth, and have no pleasure in unrighteousness." They are "taught of God," they have "seen and heard from the Father" some of the great things of the Law. The Holy Spirit has opened their eyes to see great things in the Law, and they come to the light. They are not afraid of the revelation it will make. They may be humbled and pained by the disclosure, but there is a Divine luxury in such pain. The purpose of the coming to the light on the part of one who doeth the truth, is <span class="cmt_word">in order that his works may be made manifest.</span> This is the precise contrary of the conduct of the man whose eye is scaled and whose heart is made fat by sin. Such a one dreads <span class="accented">conviction</span>, the outward affirmation or utterance of the inwardly known <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and therefore shrinks from conviction or any conduct which will promote it. He flees from the man of God, he disdains the revealing Word, he rejects the blessed Christ, he loves the darkness, this <span class="accented">is</span> his condemnation. On the other hand, the sincere man, who is honest with himself, is supremely anxious for the true light to bear down upon his "works." He is willing that they should be manifested. If he is deceiving himself with false hopes, he yearns that these should disappear before the shining of the true light. If his works will bear examination, then let him know the verdict which is unconsciously being given by the revelation of the light. It is a nice question to determine the meaning of the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. The current interpretation is for, or <span class="cmt_word">because, they are wrought in God;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sincere man desires this self-manifestation, comes to the light because his works have been inwrought by Divine grace. He loves the light, he does the truth <span class="accented">because</span> God has wrought within him to will and to do. In other words, the work of grace is in every case the adequate explanation of such a contrast to the common condition of human nature. Godet suggests that <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> here has the meaning of "that," and urges that the Greek usage in <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> and other passages will justify the translation, <span class="accented">he cometh</span>... <span class="accented">manifest, that they are wrought in God</span>, as though this Divine revelation were the real end of his coming to the light. This appears to me to be incompatible with the fact. The man who doeth the truth may yet need very much instruction before he accepts the Divine Original of his own conduct, or desires the manifestation to others of the Divine Source of his humble search. The more current translation, "because," is in harmony with the facts of Christian and religious experience, and is in keeping with the biblical assurance, that all good, all holiness, sincerity, and upright striving, just such as Nicodemus was then displaying, is God's own work, and is the result of his grace. Nicodemus comes, asks questions, receives weighty answers, and retires. We do not know the immediate result of these most wonderful words upon him; but we do find him taking the part of Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50, 51</a>); and from <a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a> we learn that, though a secret disciple, he did not disdain to come out of his hiding place to houour the corpse of the Crucified. The death of Jesus, which had blasted the hopes of the apostles, had fired those of Nicodemus. Every word of this discourse is compatible with the position of the great Prophet at this early period of his ministry, is suited to the Pharisaic mind, and adapted to meet its difficulties and correct its prejudices. If a few expressions, such as "the only begotten Son," "this is the condemnation, that," "he that doeth the truth," are found in writings which are John's undoubted composition, the circumstance may be explained that he borrowed them from Jesus. This is quite as rational (not to say legitimate and reverential) as to suppose, because of them, that John invented them, and betrayed their origin by placing them in the lips of Jesus. We do not suppose that John has mechanically recited the whole of the words that were spoken on either side, but preserved those heads of discourse which rise like mountain peaks above the oceans of thought between them, and are linked together by the glory which they severally reflect from the sublime personality of the Son of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/3-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whoever</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
