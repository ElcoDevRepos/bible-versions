His authority was representative of Roman rule over the Jewish people, highlighting the political tension of the time. Pilate's involvement fulfills the prophecy of Jesus being delivered to the Gentiles (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>). The act of taking Jesus signifies the transfer of custody from Jewish religious leaders to Roman political authority, emphasizing the collaboration between the two groups in the events leading to the crucifixion.<p><b>and had Him flogged.</b><br>Flogging, or scourging, was a brutal Roman punishment often preceding crucifixion. It involved whipping the victim with a flagrum, a whip with multiple leather thongs embedded with metal or bone, causing severe physical trauma. This act fulfilled the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "by His stripes we are healed." The flogging of Jesus is a type of His sacrificial suffering, prefiguring the atonement for sin. It also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' own prediction of His suffering (<a href="/mark/10-34.htm">Mark 10:34</a>). The severity of Roman flogging underscores the physical and emotional agony Jesus endured, highlighting His willingness to suffer for humanity's redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

This is apparently intended to indicate the time of the Crucifixion, and they thus agree generally with St. John's account.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - (d) [Within the Praetorium.] The unjust scourging, and the crown of thorns. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Then <span class="cmt_word">Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him</span>. The force of the "therefore" may be seen in the foregoing observations (see especially <a href="/luke/23-23.htm">Luke 23:23-25</a>). He obviously fancied that the sight of their Victim's utter humiliation, his reduction to the lowest possible position, would sate their burning rage. Scourging was the ordinary preliminary of crucifixion, and it might be regarded as Pilate's verdict, or the conclusion of the whole matter. Roman and Greek historians confirm the custom (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 5:11.1; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:14. 9; comp. <a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>; <a href="/luke/18-33.htm">Luke 18:33</a>) of scourging before crucifixion. It may have had a twofold motive - one to glut the desire of inflicting physical torment and ignominy, and another allied to the offer of anodyne, to hasten the final sufferings of the cross. But the governor clearly thought that he might, by first humoring the populace, in releasing Barabbas from his confinement, and then reducing to a political absurdity the charge of treason against Caesar, save the suffering Prisoner from further wrong. The morbid suggestion of a mind accustomed to gladiatorial shows, and to the sudden changes of feeling which ran through the amphitheatres at the sight of blood, not only reveals the incapacity of Pilate to understand the difference between right and wrong, but proves that he had not sounded the depth of Jewish fanaticism, nor understood the people he had been ordered to coerce. John uses the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, a purely Greek word. Matthew and Mark, who refer to the scourging which preceded Christ's being led to Calvary, use another official and technical word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (identifiable with the Latin word flagellans). This does not require us to believe in two scourgings. Matthew and Mark simply refer to the scourging, which had been arbitrarily and informally inflicted, as John informs us, before the condemnation was pronounced. The Roman punishment flagellis inflicted hideous torture. "It was executed upon slaves with thin elm rods or straps having leaden balls or sharply pointed bones attached, and was delivered on the bent, bare, and tense back." The victim was fastened to a pillar for the-purpose, the like to which has actually been found by Sir C. Warren in a subterranean cavern, on the site of what Mr. Ferguson regards as the Tower of Antonia (Westcott). The flagellation usually brought blood with the first stroke, and reduced the back to a fearful state of raw and quivering flesh. Strong men often succumbed under it, while the indignity of such a proceeding in this case must have cut far deeper into the awful sanctuary of the Sufferer's soul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/john/19-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
