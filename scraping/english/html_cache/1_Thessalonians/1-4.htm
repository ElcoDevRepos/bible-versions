This reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending social and ethnic boundaries. The phrase "beloved by God" underscores the special relationship between God and His people, echoing Old Testament themes where Israel is described as God's chosen and beloved nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). This love is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign grace, aligning with the New Testament teaching that believers are loved by God through Christ (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>).<p><b>we know that He has chosen you</b><br>The assurance "we know" reflects the apostle Paul's confidence in the Thessalonians' election, which is a central theme in Pauline theology. The concept of being "chosen" or "elect" is rooted in the Old Testament, where God chose Israel as His people (<a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8-9</a>). In the New Testament, this idea is expanded to include all who are in Christ, indicating God's sovereign initiative in salvation (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>). This election is not based on human works but on God's purpose and grace (<a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). The evidence of their election is seen in their faith, love, and hope, as well as their reception of the gospel with power and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3, 5</a>). This reflects the transformative work of Christ in believers, fulfilling the prophetic promise of a new covenant where God's law is written on hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/silvanus.htm">Silvanus (Silas)</a></b><br>- A companion of Paul, mentioned in the opening of the letter, who helped in the ministry to the Thessalonians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- Another companion of Paul, who played a significant role in the early church and in the ministry to the Thessalonians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>- A city in Macedonia where the church was established, and to whom this letter was addressed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thessalonian_church.htm">The Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a group of believers who were commended for their faith and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_election.htm">Understanding Divine Election</a></b><br>The concept of being "chosen" by God is central to understanding our identity as believers.

The tense of the word "beloved" represents not only God's attitude to them in the present, but the long continuance of it in the past, especially as proved by His election of them.

St. Paul rejoices, because the continued possession of spiritual privileges, used or abused, is an assurance of God's continued "favour and goodness towards us." Of course, however, this observation does not much affect the mysterious doctrine of predestination. The question must still remain why God brings some in this life to the knowledge of His truth, and others not; but the observation, at any rate, destroys the notion of an arbitrary damnation and salvation. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span>; that is, not the Thessalonians themselves, but we, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; knowing, being well assured cf. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren beloved</span>, your election of God; or rather, as it is in the margin and in the R.V., <span class="accented">Knowing brethren, beloved of God, your election.</span> By election is meant that act of free grace by which God destines individuals to become believers in Christ.
