He is first introduced in <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16:1-3</a>, where Paul meets him in Lystra. Timothy's mother was a Jewish believer, and his father was Greek, which gave him a unique cultural perspective that was beneficial in ministering to both Jews and Gentiles. Paul often sent Timothy to churches to represent him and to address issues, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a> and <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19-23</a>. This demonstrates the trust Paul had in Timothy's ability to lead and teach.<p><b>our brother and fellow worker for God</b><br>The term "brother" signifies the close spiritual relationship between Paul and Timothy, emphasizing the familial bond within the body of Christ. "Fellow worker" highlights Timothy's active role in the ministry. This phrase underscores the collaborative nature of early Christian missions, where individuals worked together for the advancement of the gospel. It reflects the New Testament model of ministry as a partnership, as seen in <a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>.<p><b>in the gospel of Christ</b><br>The "gospel of Christ" refers to the good news of Jesus' death, resurrection, and the salvation available through Him. This was the central message of Paul's ministry, as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>. The phrase emphasizes the divine origin and authority of the message Timothy was entrusted to share. It also connects to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to spread the gospel to all nations.<p><b>to strengthen and encourage you</b><br>The purpose of sending Timothy was to fortify the Thessalonian believers in their faith. The early church faced persecution and challenges, as noted in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6 and 2</a>:14. Strengthening and encouraging were vital to help them remain steadfast. This reflects the pastoral care and concern Paul had for the churches he planted, similar to his exhortations in <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a> and <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>.<p><b>in your faith</b><br>The focus on "faith" highlights the importance of a strong, personal belief in Jesus Christ as the foundation of the Christian life. Faith is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> and <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>. It is both a gift from God and a response to His grace. Strengthening faith involves deepening one's understanding of God's word and promises, as well as living out that faith in daily life, as encouraged in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young disciple and companion of Paul, known for his sincere faith and dedication to the gospel.

Like the shepherd who leaves the ninety-nine to look after the one (<a href="/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12-13</a>), Paul &#8220;sent&#8221; a trusted representative instead of remaining comfortably where he was (<a href="/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14-15</a>). This reminds us that genuine love moves feet and schedules, not just feelings. Love dispatches help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our brother</b><p>Timothy is not introduced by title, but by family bond. In Christ, spiritual kinship transcends geography, ethnicity, and age (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). Referring to Timothy as &#8220;our brother&#8221; underscores the warmth and equality of believers before the Father. No hierarchy here&#8212;just siblings on the same mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fellow worker for God</b><p>Paul calls Timothy a &#8220;fellow worker,&#8221; highlighting shared labor rather than solo heroics. God gathers a team (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>), and each member&#8217;s contribution matters (<a href="/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>). Ministry is partnership under divine employment; God supplies the field, the strength, and the harvest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the gospel of Christ</b><p>The assignment is laser-focused: the good news that Jesus saves. Everything Timothy does revolves around this message (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). Success is not measured by applause, but by faithfulness to &#8220;the gospel of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>). The gospel is both the banner over the mission and the power fueling it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to strengthen</b><p>Young believers often need stabilizing during storms. Timothy&#8217;s role parallels Paul&#8217;s earlier pattern of &#8220;strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). He would reinforce truth, correct misconceptions, and shore up shaky knees so the church could stand firm (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and encourage you</b><p>Encouragement breathes courage into weary hearts. &#8220;Encourage one another daily&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>) is lived out as Timothy speaks hope, reminds them of God&#8217;s promises, and models endurance. Words seasoned with grace (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>) and presence filled with compassion can lift a congregation&#8217;s spirits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in your faith</b><p>The ultimate target is their trust in Christ. Faith is a living, growing relationship (<a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>). Trials test it, but godly support refines it &#8220;of greater worth than gold&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). Timothy&#8217;s ministry aims not at mere comfort, but at a faith that stands resilient and radiant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul dispatched Timothy because love acts. Timothy, a beloved brother and co-laborer, arrived carrying the life-changing gospel, determined to fortify and cheer the Thessalonians so their faith would thrive under pressure. This verse models practical, gospel-centered care that strengthens the family of God and magnifies Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Sent.</span>--It may possibly mean that a message was despatched to him at Ber?a, ordering him to go, but is far more naturally understood if Timothy were at Athens at the time.<p><span class= "bld">And minister . . .</span>--The text here, according to the judgment of most of the best editors (though Tischendorf in his last edition has modified his opinion), is interpolated, and the verse should run: "our brother, and God's fellow-worker in the gospel of Christ." Timothy being a person so well known at Thessalonica, it is difficult to see why he should be thus particularised, unless he was the bearer of the letter, and St. Paul wished to insist upon their paying him due deference in spite of his youth.<p><span class= "bld">To establish, </span>perhaps in the sense of perfecting their organisation.<p><span class= "bld">To comfort</span> is here equivalent to "to encourage."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And sent Timotheus</span>. This was a great act of self-sacrifice on the part of Paul; because to be without an assistant and fellow-laborer in the gospel in such a city as Athens, the very center and strong hold of heathenism, full of temples and idols, must necessarily have brought upon him many discomforts; and yet his anxiety for the Thessalonians overcame all motives of personal convenience. <span class="cmt_word">Our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow-laborer.</span> The reading of manuscripts here varies. Some important manuscripts read, "our brother and fellow-worker with God" - a phrase which is elsewhere employed by the apostle: "for we are laborers together with God" (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>). Retaining, however, the reading of the text, Paul here calls Timothy his brothel expressing his esteem and fraternal affection for him; "a minister of God," expressing Timothy's official position and the honor conferred on him by Christ; and his "fellow-laborer," expressing his laborious work in preaching the gospel, and reminding the Thessalonians of his labors among them. Different reasons have been assigned for this eulogy pronounced by Paul on Timothy. Some suppose that it was to show how eagerly he consulted the welfare of the Thessalonians, by sending to them a person of such importance and of such use to himself as Timothy (Calvin); others think that it was to recommend Timothy to the favorable regard of the Thessalonians in the absence of himself (Chrysostom); but it appears to be the natural outburst of affection for his favorite disciple. <span class="cmt_word">In the gospel of Christ.</span> Timothy had labored with Paul and Silas in the publication of the gospel at Thessalonica, and was consequently well known to the Thessalonians, and favorably regarded by them. <span class="cmt_word">To establish you, and to comfort you</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">to exhort you</span>, as the matter of exhortation follows. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning your faith</span>; in order to the continuance and furtherance of your faith.
