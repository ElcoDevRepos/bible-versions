In the context of 1 Thessalonians, Paul is addressing a church that he founded during his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/17.htm">Acts 17:1-9</a>). The calling here refers to God's invitation to salvation and sanctification. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, where those whom God predestines, He also calls. The calling is not based on human merit but on God's sovereign will and grace. It reflects the personal nature of God's relationship with His people, as seen in the calling of individuals like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) and the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p><b>is faithful</b><br>God's faithfulness is a central theme throughout the Bible, underscoring His reliability and trustworthiness. In the Old Testament, God's faithfulness is often linked to His covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, where He is described as the faithful God who keeps His covenant. In the New Testament, this faithfulness is manifested in the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). The assurance of God's faithfulness provides comfort and confidence to believers, knowing that He will fulfill His promises, including the promise of eternal life (1 <a href="/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>).<p><b>and He will do it</b><br>This phrase assures believers of God's active role in their sanctification and ultimate glorification. It echoes <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses confidence that He who began a good work in believers will carry it on to completion. The "it" refers to the work of sanctification and the fulfillment of God's purposes in the lives of believers. This assurance is rooted in God's omnipotence and His commitment to His people. It also connects to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, where believers are promised resurrection and eternal life with Christ. This promise is not dependent on human effort but on God's power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>- A city in Macedonia where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.
