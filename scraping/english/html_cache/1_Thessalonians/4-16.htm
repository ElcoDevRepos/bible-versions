The Lord's descent from heaven is a fulfillment of His promise to return (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>). It reflects the ascension narrative in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>, where angels assure the disciples that Jesus will return in the same manner as He ascended. The descent signifies divine intervention and the culmination of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>with a loud command</b><br>The loud command signifies authority and power, reminiscent of Jesus' voice that calmed storms and raised the dead (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>). This command will be unmistakable and authoritative, signaling the gathering of His people. It echoes the Old Testament theophanies where God's voice is described as powerful and majestic (<a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>).<p><b>with the voice of an archangel</b><br>The mention of an archangel suggests a heavenly announcement of great significance. In <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>, Michael is referred to as an archangel, indicating a role of leadership among angels. This voice serves as a herald, proclaiming the arrival of the Lord and the unfolding of eschatological events.<p><b>and with the trumpet of God</b><br>The trumpet is a recurring symbol in biblical prophecy, often associated with divine revelation and judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). In ancient Israel, trumpets were used to call assemblies and announce significant events. Here, the trumpet of God signals the resurrection and gathering of believers, marking a pivotal moment in salvation history.<p><b>and the dead in Christ will be the first to rise</b><br>This phrase assures believers of the resurrection hope, affirming that those who have died in faith will be raised first. It aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-23</a>, where Christ is described as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. This resurrection is a testament to the victory over death achieved through Jesus' own resurrection, providing comfort and assurance to the Thessalonian believers facing persecution and loss.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who will personally return from heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God, from where Jesus will descend.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/archangel.htm">Archangel</a></b><br>A high-ranking angelic being, whose voice will accompany the Lord's return.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/trumpet_of_god.htm">Trumpet of God</a></b><br>A divine signal that heralds significant events, particularly the return of Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead_in_christ.htm">The Dead in Christ</a></b><br>Believers who have died before the return of Christ, who will be resurrected first.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_christ's_return.htm">The Certainty of Christ's Return</a></b><br>Jesus Himself will return, affirming the certainty and personal nature of His second coming.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_command.htm">The Power of God's Command</a></b><br>The loud command signifies authority and power, reminding believers of God's ultimate control over life and death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Angels in God's Plan</a></b><br>The voice of the archangel highlights the involvement of heavenly beings in the fulfillment of God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_hope_of_resurrection.htm">The Hope of Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of the dead in Christ provides hope and assurance for believers regarding life after death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_being_in_christ.htm">The Importance of Being in Christ</a></b><br>Only those who are "in Christ" will rise first, emphasizing the necessity of a personal relationship with Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thessalonians_4_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 4:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_4_16_How_does_it_inspire_hope.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 4:16 encourage us to live with hope daily?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_archangel_s_voice_in_event.htm">What role does "the voice of the archangel" play in this event?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_to_1_Cor_15_52_on_resurrection.htm">How does this verse connect with 1 Corinthians 15:52 about resurrection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_the_Lord_s_return_2.htm">In what ways can we prepare for the Lord's return as described here?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_resurrection_on_your_faith.htm">How does the promise of resurrection in this verse impact your faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thess_4_16_say_about_Jesus_return.htm">What does 1 Thessalonians 4:16 reveal about the nature of Jesus' return?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_4_16_Second_Coming_prophecies.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 4:16 align with other biblical prophecies about the Second Coming?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_trumpet_call_of_God.htm">What is the significance of the "trumpet call of God" in 1 Thessalonians 4:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_thessalonians_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Thessalonians 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_is_the_rapture_different_from_the_second_coming.htm">What distinguishes the Rapture from the Second Coming?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_1_thess._4_16_based_on_myths.htm">Could the loud command and voice of the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 stem from earlier mythologies rather than actual events? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/second_chance_post-rapture.htm">Is there a second chance after the rapture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_about_pets_in_the_rapture.htm">What happens to pets during the Rapture?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Thessalonians 4:16 Mean</div><b>For the Lord Himself</b><p>Paul begins with the certainty that Jesus, not a proxy, is coming back.

It is, however, somewhat particularised by what follows: two notes amid those sounds of mystery strike the ear--the archangel's voice, and the trump of God. Probably, therefore, the "shout of command" is uttered by the "leader of the angels;" and the trump (called "the trump of God" because used for God's purposes) is blown to summon the mustering hosts. In favour of supposing the Lord Himself to utter the cry, may be adduced <a href="/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>; but, on the other hand, it suits the dignity of the scene better to imagine the loud sound to come rather from one of the heralds of the great army.

This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5-6</a>), the Greek here refuses to be so explained. Rather, "the first thing will be the rising of the dead in Christ," contrasted with what follows--"<span class= "ital">then, </span>and not till then, shall we be caught up." The same order is carefully observed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm" title="In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.">1Corinthians 15:52</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; assigning a reason for the above assertion, "because." <span class="cmt_word">The Lord himself</span>; not merely the Lord as the chief Person and Actor on that day, in contrast to his saints, but emphatic, "<span class="accented">the</span> Lord himself," the Lord in his own proper Person. <span class="cmt_word">Shall descend from heaven</span>; where the crucified and risen Jesus is now enthroned, seated at the right hand of God. <span class="cmt_word">With a shout</span>; a word denoting a commanding shout as that of a leader to his host when he leads them into the battle, or of the army when it rushes to the fight. Some refer this shout to what follows - the voice of the archangel and the trump of God; but there are three particulars here mentioned. Others attribute it to Christ himself. <span class="cmt_word">With the voice of the archangel</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">of an archangel.</span> There is only one archangel mentioned in Scripture (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>); the word denotes, not "chief angel," but "chief or ruler of the angels." Accordingly, same suppose that Christ himself is here meant, as to him alone, it is asserted, does this title belong; but the Lord and the archangel are here evidently distinguished. Others strangely imagine that the Holy Ghost is here meant. Others fix on the archangel Michael (<a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). Christ is represented as accompanied by angels to the judgment; and it is futile to inquire who this leader of the angels is. <span class="cmt_word">And the trump of God</span>; even as the trumpet sounded at the giving of the Law from Sinai. Also the advent of Christ to judgment is represented as heralded by the sound of a trumpet (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>). "We are to recognize three particulars, following each other in rapid succession - the commanding shout of the King himself, the voice of the archangel summoning the other angels, and the trump of God which awakens the dead and collects believers" (Riggen-bach). <span class="cmt_word">And the dead in Christ shall rise first.</span> Some suppose that the reference here is to the first resurrection; that the righteous, "the dead in Christ," shall rise before the wicked, "the dead not in Christ;" and that a thousand years, or the millennium, will intervene between the first and second resurrections (<a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4, 5</a>). But this is an entirely erroneous supposition. All that is here asserted is that the dead in Christ shall rise before the living in Christ shall be changed; there is no contrast between the dead in Christ and the dead not in Christ, nor any allusion to the resurrection of the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
