In the early Christian context, this love was essential for the unity and growth of the church. The Thessalonian church, like many early Christian communities, was composed of diverse individuals who were called to live in harmony, reflecting the love of Christ. This concept is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>you do not need anyone to write to you</b><br>Paul acknowledges that the Thessalonians already understand the importance of brotherly love. This suggests that they have been practicing it effectively, likely due to the teachings they received from Paul and his companions during their initial visit. The phrase indicates a level of spiritual maturity and understanding among the Thessalonian believers, which Paul commends.<p><b>because you yourselves have been taught by God</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine origin of their understanding of love. It suggests that the Holy Spirit, who indwells believers, has been actively teaching and guiding them in the ways of love. This aligns with the promise of the New Covenant, where God writes His laws on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). It also reflects Jesus' promise that the Holy Spirit would teach and remind believers of His teachings (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>to love one another</b><br>The command to love one another is a central tenet of Christian teaching, echoing Jesus' new commandment to His disciples (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). This love is not merely an emotion but an active commitment to seek the welfare of others, reflecting the sacrificial love of Christ. The Thessalonians' practice of this love serves as a testimony to their faith and obedience to God's will, setting an example for other believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is writing to the Thessalonian church to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians in Thessalonica, a city in Macedonia, who are known for their faith and love.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate teacher of love, as Paul emphasizes that the Thessalonians have been taught by God Himself to love one another.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brotherly_love.htm">Brotherly Love (Philadelphia)</a></b><br>The specific type of love Paul refers to, which is characterized by affection and care among believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>The region where Thessalonica is located, significant for its early acceptance of the Gospel and the love demonstrated by its churches.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_instruction_in_love.htm">Divine Instruction in Love</a></b><br>God Himself is the ultimate teacher of love, and His instruction is evident in the lives of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_brotherly_love.htm">The Nature of Brotherly Love</a></b><br>Brotherly love (Greek: "philadelphia") is a familial affection that should characterize the relationships within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_evidence_of_faith.htm">Love as Evidence of Faith</a></b><br>The love among believers serves as a testimony to their faith and the transformative power of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_to_continue_in_love.htm">Encouragement to Continue in Love</a></b><br>Even when love is present, there is always room for growth and deeper expression of love within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_a_witness_to_the_world.htm">Love as a Witness to the World</a></b><br>The love demonstrated by Christians is a powerful witness to the world of God's love and the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thessalonians_4_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 4:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Thessalonians_4_9_Deepen_our_love.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 4:9 encourage us to love others more deeply?

Earlier he had highlighted &#8220;your labor prompted by love&#8221; in <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>, and here he circles back to that same theme. Jesus set the standard: &#8220;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>). Brotherly love is not optional seasoning for Christian life; it is the very aroma that identifies us as family (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you do not need anyone to write to you</b><p>Paul&#8217;s tone is warm and affirming. He says in effect, I am not introducing something foreign. Their love was already being broadcast &#8220;to all the brothers throughout Macedonia&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>). Likewise, in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:3</a> he again commends their ever-growing love. The message: genuine love is so visible that it hardly needs letters to validate it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you yourselves</b><p>The phrase underscores personal ownership. Every believer, not just pastors or seasoned saints, participates. Peter echoes this individual call: &#8220;Since you have purified your souls&#8230; love one another deeply, from a pure heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>). Paul reminds the Galatians, &#8220;Serve one another in love&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>). Love is everyone&#8217;s assignment, woven into daily choices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have been taught by God</b><p>What equipped these believers? God Himself. Isaiah foretold, &#8220;All your children will be taught by the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>). Jesus quoted that promise in <a href="/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>. Under the new covenant God writes His law on our hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>). The Holy Spirit pours out God&#8217;s love within us (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>) and gives an inward witness that trains us better than a thousand classrooms (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>,27). Divine instruction means love is more than theory; it is Spirit-empowered practice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to love one another</b><p>Here is the purpose clause: everything God teaches aims at this single outcome. Jesus framed it as a &#8220;new commandment&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). John later unpacked it: &#8220;We know love by this, that Jesus laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16-18</a>). Practical expressions include:<p>&#8226; welcoming outsiders into fellowship (<a href="/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>)<p>&#8226; bearing with weaknesses and forgiving quickly (<a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>)<p>&#8226; sharing resources so no one lacks (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>)<p>&#8226; encouraging one another daily (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>)<p>Love is not sentiment alone; it takes shape in tangible sacrifice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a> celebrates a church already glowing with brotherly love. Paul&#8217;s short line reveals four truths: love is the family trademark, every believer owns the responsibility, God Himself tutors our hearts, and the goal is active, sacrificial care for one another. As we yield to the Spirit who teaches from within, our lives echo the same melody the Thessalonians played so well&#8212;a melody the world still needs to hear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">But . . .</span>--This forms the second subject of instruction, following naturally on the first. "We are very glad to hear of so strong a Christian feeling of brotherhood among you, and think it almost unnecessary to say anything more to you about it; still your charity is hardly <span class= "ital">catholic</span> enough, nor have you exercised it with sufficient sobriety and thrift."<p><span class= "bld">Brotherly love.</span>--Not love of men at large, but of Christians in particular: in fact, pretty nearly what we call "Church feeling." It is the <span class= "ital">natural affection</span> of those who feel that they are children of the same Father and the same mother (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>), members of the same "household of faith" (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>). In itself, it is not the most exalted of graces, being to some extent the outcome of community of interests; therefore St. Peter exhorts his readers to make it a means of obtaining the higher grace of <span class= "ital">charity</span> (<a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-7.htm" title="And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.">2Peter 1:7</a>). St. Paul in this place does mean the sentiment rather than the practice, but has specially in view the exercise of liberality towards fellow-Christians. The feeling of community can only be known by acts that prove it.<p><span class= "bld">Ye need not.</span>--A sweet rhetorical figure, by which men are encouraged to the performance of a duty in which they are not perfect, by the praising of their imperfect attempts: a specimen of that "courtesy" which is a part of "brotherly love." (See <a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm" title="Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:">1Peter 3:8</a>.)

This virtue is often inculcated in Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>), and is distinguished from love in general (<a href="/2_peter/1-7.htm">2 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye need not that I write unto you</span>; a delicate and gentle reproof. <span class="cmt_word">For ye yourselves are taught of God.</span> We are not here to think of the new commandment of brotherly love given by the Savior, nor on the Divine compassion exciting us to love; but "taught of God" by the influences of the Spirit on their hearts and consciences to love one another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brotherly love,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(philadelphias)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5360.htm">Strong's 5360: </a> </span><span class="str2">Brotherly love, love of Christian brethren.
