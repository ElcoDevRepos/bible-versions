The term "brothers" signifies the familial relationship among believers, emphasizing unity and equality within the church. This familial language is consistent with Paul's other letters, such as in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, where he often uses "brothers" to address the community of faith.<p><b>to acknowledge those who work diligently among you,</b><br>Acknowledging leaders is a call to recognize and respect those who labor for the church. The Greek term for "work diligently" implies continuous, strenuous effort. This reflects the early church's structure, where leaders were often bivocational, balancing ministry with other work. The concept of diligent work is echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, where elders who lead well are considered worthy of double honor.<p><b>who care for you in the Lord</b><br>This phrase highlights the pastoral role of leaders, who are responsible for the spiritual well-being of the congregation. "In the Lord" indicates that their authority and care are derived from their relationship with Christ. This aligns with the shepherd imagery found in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is the Good Shepherd, and leaders are called to emulate His care and guidance.<p><b>and who admonish you.</b><br>Admonishment involves correction and instruction, a necessary function of church leadership. This is not merely criticism but is intended for growth and edification, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, where Scripture is used for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.

It is specially interesting to notice how much <span class= "ital">power</span> is given to the presbytery in this earliest writing of the New Testament, and how carefully St. Paul seems to have organised his churches, and that at the very foundation of them.
