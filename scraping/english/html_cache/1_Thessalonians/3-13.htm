The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. The idea of God establishing hearts suggests a firm foundation, echoing <a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>, where the righteous are described as having steadfast hearts. This divine action is necessary for spiritual stability and growth.<p><b>in blamelessness and holiness</b><br>Blamelessness refers to a state of being without fault or guilt, while holiness denotes being set apart for God's purposes. These qualities are essential for believers, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, where Paul writes about being holy and blameless before God. The call to holiness is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's own nature (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>before our God and Father</b><br>This phrase highlights the relational aspect of the believer's life with God, who is both a sovereign deity and a loving Father. The dual role of God as both judge and parent is seen throughout the Bible, providing both accountability and intimacy. The presence of God as Father is a comforting assurance of His care and guidance, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>.<p><b>at the coming of our Lord Jesus</b><br>The coming of Jesus, or Parousia, is a central eschatological event in Christian theology. It refers to the anticipated return of Christ, as promised in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>. This event is characterized by judgment and the fulfillment of God's kingdom. The expectation of Christ's return serves as motivation for ethical living and spiritual readiness, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-11.htm">2 Peter 3:11-12</a>.<p><b>with all His saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to all believers, both living and deceased, who are sanctified in Christ. This gathering of saints at Christ's return is a fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>, where the kingdom is given to the saints. It also reflects the communal aspect of salvation, where believers are united with Christ and each other.<p><b>Amen.</b><br>"Amen" is a term of affirmation, meaning "truly" or "so be it." It is used to express agreement with what has been said, often concluding prayers or doxologies. Its use here underscores the certainty and hope in the promises of God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20-21</a>, where the return of Christ is affirmed with "Amen."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Thessalonians, providing guidance and encouragement to the early Christian community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the early church was established, facing persecution and challenges in maintaining their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The divine being to whom believers are accountable and before whom they are to be blameless and holy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_jesus.htm">Lord Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose second coming is anticipated by believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the holy ones, possibly including both angels and believers who have passed on, who will accompany Jesus at His return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>Believers are called to live lives of holiness and blamelessness, reflecting the character of God.

St. Paul is already thinking, probably, how he shall treat the subject of chastity in the next chapter. (See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm" title="That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.">1Thessalonians 4:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before God . . .</span> <span class= "bld">at the coming.</span>--The hearts are to be unblamably holy before God--not only all through life, but also at the Judgment Day, when Jesus Christ is to judge us in the Father's presence. Though He has "committed all judgment unto the Son" (<a href="/john/5-22.htm" title="For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:">John 5:22</a>), yet the judgment is His own, and the Son is the agent <span class= "ital">by</span> whom He judges, just as He is the agent by whom He creates (see <a href="/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>): therefore in that day it is in the Father's sight rather than in the Son's (though there can be no divergence between Them) that we are to be able to clear ourselves.<p><span class= "bld">With all his saints</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, attended by them:-<p>"Thousand, thousand saints <span class= "ital">attending, . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end</span> (<span class="accented">in order that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God.</span> In the sight of God, in his judgment who searcheth the hearts.
