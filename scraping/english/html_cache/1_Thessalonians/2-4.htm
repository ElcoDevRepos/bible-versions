In the context of 1 Thessalonians, Paul defends his ministry against accusations of deceit or impure motives. The term "approved by God" suggests a process of testing and validation, akin to refining metals (<a href="/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>). This approval is not self-proclaimed but recognized by God, aligning with the biblical theme that true ministry is divinely sanctioned (<a href="/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>). The apostles' authority is rooted in their calling and commissioning by Christ (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p><b>to be entrusted with the gospel</b><br>The gospel, or "good news," is the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Being "entrusted" implies a stewardship responsibility, as seen in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). Paul and his companions are depicted as faithful stewards (<a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>), highlighting the sacred duty to preserve and proclaim the gospel accurately. This trust underscores the seriousness of their mission, reflecting the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>not in order to please men</b><br>Paul contrasts his motives with those of false teachers who seek human approval (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The cultural context of the Greco-Roman world often involved orators and philosophers who sought popularity and financial gain. Paul distinguishes his ministry by prioritizing divine approval over human accolades, echoing Jesus' teaching on serving two masters (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><b>but God, who examines our hearts</b><br>This phrase underscores God's omniscience and the sincerity required in ministry. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, intentions, and emotions (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). God's examination is thorough and discerning, ensuring that motives align with His will. This divine scrutiny is a recurring theme, reminding believers of the importance of integrity and transparency before God (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians, emphasizing his role as a messenger approved by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>- A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church and to whom this letter is addressed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The ultimate judge who examines the hearts of individuals, ensuring their motives align with His will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>- The message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which Paul and his companions were entrusted to share.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thessalonian_church.htm">The Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, who were being encouraged to remain steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_approval_over_human_approval.htm">Divine Approval Over Human Approval</a></b><br>As Christians, our primary goal should be to seek God's approval rather than the approval of people.
