This term reflects the early Christian understanding of the church as a family, transcending ethnic and social boundaries. The use of "recall" suggests that Paul is reminding them of something they have personally witnessed, emphasizing the authenticity and transparency of his ministry.<p><b>our labor and toil.</b><br>Paul's mention of "labor and toil" highlights the physical and mental effort he and his companions exerted in their ministry. This phrase underscores the apostolic commitment to hard work, reflecting the broader biblical principle that ministry often involves sacrifice and perseverance. In the Greco-Roman world, manual labor was often looked down upon, yet Paul embraces it, setting an example of humility and dedication.<p><b>We worked night and day</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of Paul's dedication, working tirelessly to support himself and his mission. The reference to "night and day" suggests a continuous effort, possibly indicating that Paul engaged in tent-making or another trade to provide for his needs. This self-sufficiency was crucial in maintaining the integrity of his message, ensuring that the gospel was not associated with financial gain.<p><b>so that we would not be a burden to anyone</b><br>Paul's intention was to avoid being a financial burden to the Thessalonian church. This reflects a broader biblical principle of selflessness and consideration for others, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>. By supporting himself, Paul ensured that his motives could not be questioned, maintaining the purity of his ministry and setting a precedent for future church leaders.<p><b>while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</b><br>The central focus of Paul's ministry was the proclamation of the "gospel of God," emphasizing the divine origin and authority of the message. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ. Paul's commitment to preaching the gospel, despite personal hardship, reflects the urgency and importance of the message, as seen throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Thessalonians, emphasizing his dedication and hard work in spreading the gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul, along with Silas and Timothy, established a church during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas_and_timothy.htm">Silas and Timothy</a></b><br>Companions of Paul who assisted in the ministry and were co-authors of the letter to the Thessalonians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_believers.htm">Thessalonian Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, who were encouraged by Paul&#8217;s example of hard work and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel_of_god.htm">The Gospel of God</a></b><br>The central message of salvation through Jesus Christ that Paul and his companions proclaimed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_hard_work_in_ministry.htm">The Value of Hard Work in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s example shows that ministry involves dedication and effort.

By paying his own way, he guarded the young Thessalonian church from accusations that Christianity was a money-making scheme, mirroring Nehemiah&#8217;s refusal to tax the people while rebuilding Jerusalem&#8217;s walls (<a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God</b><p>The whole purpose of the self-sacrifice was clear proclamation.

It does not denote that the apostle made up by labor at night the loss of time during the day which his higher duties, as a preacher of the gospel, occasioned; that he wrought at his trade at night, and preached during the (lay; but the phrase, "night and day," denotes incessantly, continually. <span class="cmt_word">Because we would not be chargeable to any of you.</span> Not a proof of the poverty of the Church of Thessalonica; but the reason of this unselfish conduct of the apostle was that no hindrance should arise on his part to the spread of the gospel; that no imputation of selfishness or covetousness should be laid to his charge. As he had done at Thessalonica so the apostle acted in other places. Thus at the time he was writing this Epistle he was working for his support at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>). And such was also his practice at Ephesus; for in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders he could appeal to them: "Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me" (<a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a><span class="cmt_word">).
