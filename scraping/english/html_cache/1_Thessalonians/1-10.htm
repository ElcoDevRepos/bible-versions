The Thessalonians were encouraged to live in expectation of Jesus' second coming, reflecting the teachings of Jesus in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>. The concept of waiting for the Son from heaven underscores the belief in Jesus' divine origin and His promised return, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>, where angels assure the disciples that Jesus will return in the same manner as He ascended.<p><b>whom He raised from the dead</b><br>This phrase affirms the resurrection of Jesus, a foundational doctrine of Christianity. The resurrection is a testament to God's power and serves as the cornerstone of Christian faith, as Paul elaborates in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>. The resurrection not only validates Jesus' divinity but also assures believers of their future resurrection and eternal life, as promised in <a href="/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>. The historical event of the resurrection is supported by multiple eyewitness accounts, as recorded in the Gospels and Acts.<p><b>Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath</b><br>Here, Jesus is identified as the deliverer, highlighting His role in salvation. The "coming wrath" refers to God's judgment upon the world, a theme prevalent in both Old and New Testament prophecies, such as in <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16-17</a>. Jesus' deliverance is not only from eternal separation from God but also from the impending judgment, as He bore the wrath of God on the cross for humanity's sins (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). This deliverance is a fulfillment of God's promise of salvation through the Messiah, as foretold in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, recognized as the Son of God, who was raised from the dead and is awaited by believers for His return.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where Paul established a church.
