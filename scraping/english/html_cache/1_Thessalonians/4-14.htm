The death of Jesus is central to the atonement theology, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where Christ's death is portrayed as a demonstration of God's love. The resurrection is equally crucial, serving as the validation of Jesus' divine nature and the promise of eternal life, as emphasized in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>. Historically, the resurrection was a pivotal event that transformed the early disciples, empowering them to spread the Gospel despite persecution. The resurrection also fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which speaks of God not allowing His Holy One to see decay.<p><b>we also believe that God will bring with Jesus</b><br>This phrase highlights the eschatological hope of believers, rooted in the promise of Christ's return. The concept of God bringing believers with Jesus is tied to the Second Coming, a theme prevalent in New Testament eschatology, particularly in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30-31</a>. Theologically, this reflects the belief in the bodily resurrection of the dead and the gathering of believers to Christ, as further explained in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>. The phrase underscores the continuity of God's redemptive plan, from the resurrection of Christ to the ultimate restoration of all things.<p><b>those who have fallen asleep in Him</b><br>The term "fallen asleep" is a euphemism for death, used in the New Testament to convey the temporary nature of death for believers, as seen in <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-13</a>. This reflects the early Christian understanding of death as a state of rest before the resurrection. The phrase "in Him" signifies the union of believers with Christ, a central theme in Pauline theology, as expressed in passages like <a href="/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>, which speaks of being united with Christ in His death and resurrection. This union assures believers of their participation in the resurrection and eternal life, reinforcing the hope and comfort offered to the Thessalonian church amidst concerns about deceased loved ones.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the Christian faith, Jesus' death and resurrection are foundational events that affirm His divinity and the hope of eternal life for believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who orchestrates the resurrection and the return of Jesus, affirming His power over life and death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers ("those who have fallen asleep in Him")</a></b><br>Refers to Christians who have died, with the metaphor of sleep indicating a temporary state before resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>The city where the church receiving this letter is located, a significant urban center in ancient Macedonia.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, providing guidance and encouragement to the Thessalonian believers regarding the hope of resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_resurrection.htm">The Certainty of Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is a historical and theological certainty that assures believers of their own future resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_beyond_death.htm">Hope Beyond Death</a></b><br>The metaphor of sleep for death provides comfort, indicating that death is not the end but a transition to eternal life with Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Belief in the resurrection should influence how Christians live, encouraging a life of holiness and hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_of_believers.htm">Community of Believers</a></b><br>The promise of resurrection fosters a sense of unity and encouragement among believers, as they share in this common hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to bring about the resurrection underscores His ultimate authority over life and death.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thessalonians_4_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_4_14_Believers_resurrection.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 4:14 assure us of believers' resurrection with Jesus?

The simpler words in <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a> mean "dying in full communion still with Him."

Additional sweetness is imparted to the phrase by the use of the metaphor of <span class= "ital">sleep;</span> but it is, perhaps, too much to say, as Dean Alford does, that "falling asleep" is here contrasted with "dying," in this sense:--"Who through the power of Jesus fell asleep instead of dying"--for the word is even used of <span class= "ital">a judicial punishment</span> of death in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1Corinthians 11:30</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again.</span> The apostle's argument proceeds on the supposition that Christ and believers are one body, of which Christ is the Head and believers are the members; and that consequently what happens to the Head must happen to the members. Our knowledge and belief of a future state, and especially of the resurrection, is founded on the resurrection of Christ (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so them also which sleep in Jesus</span>; or more literally, <span class="accented">through Jesus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Will God bring with him</span>; namely, with Jesus. These words are differently construed. Some read them thus: "Even so them also which sleep will God through Jesus bring with him" (De Wette, Lunemann); but this appears to be an awkward construction; as we must then render the clause, "will God through Jesus bring with Jesus." It is, therefore, better to refer the words, "through Jesus," to the first clause. It is through Jesus that believers fall asleep; it is he who changes the nature of death, for all his people, from being the king of terrors into a quiet and gentle sleep, from which they will awaken to eternal life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
