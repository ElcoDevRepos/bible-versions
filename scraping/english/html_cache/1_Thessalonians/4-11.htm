In the context of the early church, this was a call to avoid unnecessary conflict and to live in a manner that reflects the peace of Christ (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). The Greek word for "aspire" suggests a deliberate and earnest effort, indicating that living quietly is a goal to be actively pursued. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching of living peaceably with all (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). In a cultural context where public honor and status were often sought, this instruction emphasizes humility and contentment.<p><b>to attend to your own matters</b><br>This directive advises believers to focus on their personal responsibilities and not meddle in the affairs of others. It reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17</a>, which warns against involving oneself in disputes not one's own. In the early Christian communities, this was crucial for maintaining harmony and avoiding gossip or division. The instruction also aligns with the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-3.htm">Matthew 7:3-5</a> about addressing one's own faults before criticizing others. This principle promotes personal accountability and integrity.<p><b>and to work with your own hands</b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of manual labor, which was a common expectation in the Greco-Roman world. This instruction counters any tendency towards idleness, which Paul addresses more directly in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10-12</a>. By encouraging work, Paul upholds the dignity of labor and the value of self-sufficiency. This also reflects the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the garden to work it. In a spiritual sense, working with one's hands can be seen as a type of Christ, who Himself was a carpenter, embodying humility and service.<p><b>as we instructed you</b><br>This phrase indicates that these teachings were not new but had been part of Paul's original instruction to the Thessalonians. It underscores the consistency and continuity of apostolic teaching. The use of "we" suggests that this was a collective instruction from Paul and his companions, reinforcing the authority and unity of their message. This continuity is important for the early church as it establishes a foundation for Christian conduct that is rooted in apostolic tradition, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is writing to the Thessalonian church to provide guidance and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>A city in Macedonia where the church was established by Paul during his second missionary journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonian_church.htm">Thessalonian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of early Christians facing persecution and needing instruction on living a godly life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/silas_and_timothy.htm">Silas and Timothy</a></b><br>Companions of Paul who were involved in the ministry to the Thessalonians and likely contributed to the teachings referenced in the letter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>The region where Thessalonica is located, significant for its role in the spread of early Christianity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/ambition_for_quietness.htm">Ambition for Quietness</a></b><br>Christians are encouraged to aspire to a life marked by peace and tranquility, avoiding unnecessary conflict and drama.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/mind_your_own_business.htm">Mind Your Own Business</a></b><br>Believers should focus on their own responsibilities and not meddle in the affairs of others, promoting harmony and respect within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dignity_in_labor.htm">Dignity in Labor</a></b><br>Working with one's hands is a noble pursuit, reflecting God's design for human productivity and stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/instruction_and_obedience.htm">Instruction and Obedience</a></b><br>The Thessalonians are reminded to adhere to the teachings they received, highlighting the importance of following apostolic instruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_through_lifestyle.htm">Witness Through Lifestyle</a></b><br>Leading a quiet and industrious life serves as a testimony to non-believers, demonstrating the transformative power of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Thessalonians_4_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Thessalonians 4:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_quietly_today.htm">How can we "aspire to live quietly" in our daily lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_mind_your_affairs_in_church.htm">What does "mind your own affairs" mean in a Christian community context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Thess_4_11_vs_Proverbs_on_wisdom_speech.htm">How does 1 Thessalonians 4:11 relate to Proverbs' teachings on wisdom and speech?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_handiwork_honor_God_and_serve.htm">In what ways can working with our hands honor God and serve others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_1_Thess_4_11_on_non-believers.htm">How can implementing 1 Thessalonians 4:11 improve our witness to non-believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_live_quietly_mean_today.htm">What does "aspire to live quietly" mean in 1 Thessalonians 4:11 for modern Christians?

It is a strong use of the rhetorical figure called <span class= "ital">oxymoron, </span>or combining words of contrary meaning in order to give force and point to the style. The warnings in this verse are not directed against <span class= "ital">defiance</span> of the law of brotherly love, but against a thoroughly wrong mode of <span class= "ital">showing</span> that love: the unquietness, meddlesomeness, desultoriness with which it was accompanied are not so much instances of unkindness to the brotherhood as scandals to the heathen. Hence the conjunction at the beginning of the verse has something of an adversative force: "We beg you to be even more abundantly liberal, and (yet) at the same time to agitate for perfect calmness about it." It is commonly supposed (but proof is impossible) that the unsettlement arose from belief in the nearness of the Advent.<p><span class= "bld">Do your own business.</span>--Not merely was each individual to do his own work, but the whole Church was to refrain from interfering ostentatiously with other Churches. In all languages, "to mind one's own business" signifies rather the negative idea of ceasing to meddle than the positive idea of industry.<p><span class= "bld">Work with your own hands.</span>--Apparently the Thessalonians had been so busy in organising away from home that they had had no time to see to their own industry, and so (see end of next verse) were beginning to fall into difficulties. The words "with your own hands" are supposed to indicate that most of the Thessalonian Christians were of the artisan class.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that ye study</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ye be ambitious. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To be quiet</span>; to avoid unrest, to live in peace. Worldly ambition excludes quietness and prompts to restlessness; so that the apostle's admonition really is, "that ye be ambitious not to be ambitious." The unrest which disturbed the peace of the Thessalonian Church was not political, but religions; it arose from the excitement naturally occasioned by the entrance of the new feeling of Christianity among them. It would also appear that they were excited by the idea of Christ's immediate advent. This had occasioned disorders, and had caused several to neglect their ordinary business and to give themselves over to an indolent inactivity, so that Christian prudence was overborne (comp. <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6-12</a>).
