The reference to the killing of Jesus points to the crucifixion, a central event in Christian theology, where Jesus, the Messiah, was rejected and executed by the religious leaders and Roman authorities. This act is seen as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. The mention of "their own prophets" connects to the historical pattern of Israel rejecting and persecuting prophets sent by God, as seen in the cases of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>). This pattern underscores the persistent resistance to divine messages and messengers.<p><b>and drove us out as well</b><br>This phrase refers to the persecution faced by Paul and his companions, who were often expelled from cities due to their preaching of the Gospel. In <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5-10</a>, we see an example of this in Thessalonica, where Paul and Silas were forced to leave due to opposition from the Jewish leaders. This expulsion is part of the broader theme of apostolic suffering and perseverance in the face of hostility, as seen throughout the Acts of the Apostles. It also reflects the early Christian experience of being marginalized and rejected by both Jewish and Gentile communities.<p><b>They are displeasing to God</b><br>This statement indicates a divine judgment on those who oppose God's work and His messengers. The displeasure of God is a serious matter, as it implies a rejection of His will and purposes. Throughout the Bible, God's displeasure is often linked to disobedience and rebellion, as seen in the stories of Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>) and the rejection of God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>). This phrase serves as a warning against resisting God's plans and highlights the importance of aligning with His purposes.<p><b>and hostile to all men</b><br>This phrase suggests that the opposition faced by Paul and other early Christians was not only against them but was also detrimental to humanity as a whole. By rejecting the Gospel, which is the message of salvation and reconciliation, these opponents were acting against the best interests of all people. The hostility towards the Gospel is seen as a barrier to the spread of God's love and truth, which is intended for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). This phrase underscores the universal scope of the Gospel and the tragic consequences of opposing it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_jesus.htm">The Lord Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of Christianity, whose crucifixion is referenced here as a pivotal event in salvation history.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets who were often persecuted and killed for delivering God's messages.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_his_companions.htm">Paul and His Companions</a></b><br>The apostles, including Paul, who faced persecution and were driven out by those opposed to their message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_leaders.htm">The Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>Those who opposed Jesus and the early Christian message, often seen as responsible for the persecution of prophets and apostles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thessalonica.htm">Thessalonica</a></b><br>The city where the Thessalonian church was located, and where Paul faced opposition during his missionary journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/persecution_of_god's_messengers.htm">Persecution of God's Messengers</a></b><br>Throughout history, God's messengers have faced persecution.

Objection is often made to St. John's Gospel on the ground that no born Jew could have written of "the Jews" in the bitter way so common in that book, or viewed them so completely as a separate body from himself. This passage, in an indubitable epistle of "a Hebrew of the Hebrews." seems a satisfactory answer. The memories of St. Stephen's speech (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>) seem to be waking in the mind of him who was once a persecuting Jew himself.<p><span class= "bld">Have persecuted.</span>--Take the marginal version, "chased" (not <span class= "ital">"have</span> chased") "us violently out of Thessalonica."<p><span class= "bld">They please</span> <span class= "bld">not God</span>--(though to serve and please Him was the special purpose for which the nation was set apart, ) "and are at cross purposes with all mankind." The historian Tacitus gives, as a characteristic of the race, "an attitude of hostility and hatred towards all others." Juvenal makes the same accusation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who both killed the Lord Jesus</span>; emphatic, to point out the greatness of their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">And their own prophets</span>; or, as some manuscripts read, <span class="accented">and the prophets</span>. This crime was often laid to the charge of the Jews: thus, by our Lord, "Ye are witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets" (<a href="/matthew/23-31.htm">Matthew 23:31</a>); and by the protomartyr Stephen, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?" (<a href="/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And have persecuted us</span>; literally, <span class="accented">driven us out</span>, as Paul and Silos were expelled from Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And they please not God, but are contrary to all men.</span> The hatred and contempt which the Jews bore to other nations is noticed by Tacitus, Juvenal, and other heathen writers. Thus Tacitus writes of them: "They are faithful to obstinacy, and merciful toward themselves, but toward all others are actuated by the most irreconcilable hatred (<span class="accented">odium humani generis</span>)." And Juvenal says, "They will not show the road to one who was not of their religion, nor lead the thirsty person if uncircumcised to the common spring." Perhaps, however, the apostle refers here, not to the enmity of the Jews to the human race in general, though perfectly cognizant of their bigotry and intolerance; as this enmity was a perversion of their peculiar distinction as he people of God; but rather to their opposition to his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles - to their extreme reluctance that the Gentiles along with themselves should be admitted into the kingdom of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
