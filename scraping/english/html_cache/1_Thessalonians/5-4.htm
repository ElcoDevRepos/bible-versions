The term "brothers" indicates a close, familial relationship among believers, transcending ethnic and social boundaries.

Here, it contrasts with the "light" of Christ and truth. The Thessalonians, having received the gospel, are no longer in spiritual ignorance or moral darkness. This echoes <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the "light of the world," and those who follow Him will not walk in darkness.<p><b>so that this day</b><br>"This day" refers to the Day of the Lord, a concept rooted in Old Testament prophecy (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, <a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>) and further developed in the New Testament. It signifies a future time of divine judgment and salvation. The Thessalonians are reminded of their awareness and preparedness for this significant eschatological event.<p><b>should overtake you like a thief.</b><br>The imagery of a thief suggests suddenness and unexpectedness, a common biblical metaphor for the coming of the Lord (see <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>).
