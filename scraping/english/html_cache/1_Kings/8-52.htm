The "eyes" of God symbolize His awareness and readiness to respond to the needs of His people. In the ancient Near Eastern context, deities were often thought to be distant, but Solomon's prayer reflects a belief in a personal God who is actively involved in the lives of His people. The "servant" refers to Solomon himself, highlighting his role as the intercessor for Israel. The phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to be attentive to His chosen people. This plea for divine attention is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, which states, "The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are attentive to their cry."<p><b>and may You listen to them whenever they call to You</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the importance of prayer and God's willingness to hear His people. The act of calling upon God is a central theme throughout the Bible, illustrating the dependence of humanity on divine intervention. The phrase "whenever they call" suggests an ongoing, continuous relationship, not limited by time or circumstance. This reflects the biblical teaching that God is always accessible to those who seek Him, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12</a>, "Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you." The assurance of God's listening ear is a source of comfort and hope, encouraging believers to persist in prayer. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Jesus as the mediator between God and humanity, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, where Christ is the ultimate intercessor who ensures that God hears the prayers of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom Solomon is interceding for in his prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, to whom Solomon directs his prayer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dedication_of_the_temple.htm">The Dedication of the Temple</a></b><br>A significant event where Solomon prays for God's continued presence and favor upon Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_attentiveness.htm">God's Attentiveness</a></b><br>God is attentive to the prayers of His people.
