Solomon's ascension to the throne marks the continuation of the Davidic dynasty, which is central to the biblical narrative. The throne symbolizes authority and the divine right to rule, as God had chosen David and his lineage to lead Israel. This transition of power also reflects the stability and continuity of God's covenant with David, which is a precursor to the eternal kingship of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>and his kingdom was firmly established</b><br>The establishment of Solomon's kingdom indicates a period of peace and consolidation of power, which was necessary for the prosperity and expansion of Israel. This stability was achieved through Solomon's wisdom, which he famously requested from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The phrase also suggests that potential threats to Solomon's reign, such as rival claims to the throne, were effectively neutralized, as seen in the earlier chapters of 1 Kings. This firm establishment is a type of the ultimate peace and order that will be realized in the Kingdom of God under the reign of Christ, who is the true and eternal King. Solomon's reign is often seen as a golden age for Israel, foreshadowing the perfect and everlasting kingdom promised in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.

Like <a href="/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>, it underscores Solomon&#8217;s legitimate coronation.<p>&#8211; &#8226; The throne itself symbolizes divine authority delegated to Israel&#8217;s king (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5</a>). Solomon occupies a seat God established, stressing the continuity of God&#8217;s rule through David&#8217;s line (<a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8226; By sitting, Solomon moves from prince to reigning monarch, a decisive moment Gideon and Absalom never reached (cf. <a href="/judges/8-22.htm">Judges 8:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of his father David</b><p>&#8211; &#8226; The verse ties Solomon&#8217;s identity to David, underscoring lineage and covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8226; David&#8217;s throne carries memories of victories, worship, and repentance; Solomon inherits both privilege and responsibility (<a href="/1_kings/2-3.htm">1 Kings 2:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8226; This father-son connection prefigures the greater Son of David, Jesus, who will sit on an eternal throne (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his kingdom was firmly established</b><p>&#8211; &#8226; The Hebrew narrative often pauses to declare that a reign &#8220;was firmly established&#8221; after threats are neutralized (<a href="/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24, 45</a>). Here it means internal opposition (Adonijah, Joab, Shimei) had been addressed, securing peace.<p>&#8211; &#8226; God, not merely Solomon&#8217;s strategies, established the kingdom (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>).
