The context is Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple, where he anticipates future disobedience leading to exile. The phrase "come to their senses" implies a moment of clarity and repentance, similar to the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>. Historically, the Israelites experienced exile in Babylon, a significant event that fulfilled earlier warnings from prophets like Jeremiah. The land of their captors, Babylon, was a place of both punishment and reflection, where the Israelites were meant to remember their covenant with God.<p><b>and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors</b><br>Repentance is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing a return to God with a contrite heart. In the context of exile, repentance involves acknowledging sin and seeking God's forgiveness. The act of pleading suggests earnest prayer and supplication, a common practice among the Israelites during times of distress. This mirrors the call to repentance found in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear from heaven and heal the land if His people humble themselves and pray. The land of their captors serves as a backdrop for this spiritual renewal, highlighting God's willingness to forgive even in foreign lands.<p><b>saying, &#8216;We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,&#8217;</b><br>This confession acknowledges the gravity of their actions, using a threefold expression of sinfulness. The language reflects a deep understanding of their moral failure, similar to the confessions found in <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a>. The repetition underscores the seriousness of their transgressions and the need for divine mercy. This pattern of confession and repentance is a precursor to the New Testament message of forgiveness through Jesus Christ, who calls sinners to repentance and offers redemption. The acknowledgment of sin is the first step toward reconciliation with God, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

These repeated coincidences lead to the belief that the prayer was based upon and compiled from the Pentateuch] <span class="cmt_word">in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have Committed wickedness.</span> [This verse is full of <span class="accented">paronomasia</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span>, etc. Words almost identical with this confession were used (<a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>) by the Jews in their captivity at Babylon, from which it has been concluded that this part of the prayer must belong to the time of the captivity. But surely it is, to say the least, just as likely that the Jews, when the captivity of which Solomon spoke befel them, borrowed the phrase in which their great king by anticipation expressed their penitence. Seeing in the captivity a fulfilment of his prediction, they would naturally see in this formula, which no doubt had been preserved in the writings of the prophets, a confession specially appropriate to their case, and indeed provided for their use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/8-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and when they come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;
