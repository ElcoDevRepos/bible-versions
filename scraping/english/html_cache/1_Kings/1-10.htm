His absence from Adonijah's gathering indicates a deliberate exclusion of those loyal to David and God's chosen successor, Solomon. Nathan's prophetic authority and influence would have posed a threat to Adonijah's claim to the throne, as Nathan had previously supported Solomon's anointing (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-34</a>).<p><b>Benaiah</b><br>Benaiah was a valiant warrior and leader of David's bodyguard (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>). His loyalty to David and later to Solomon made him a significant military figure. Excluding Benaiah suggests Adonijah's awareness of Benaiah's allegiance to Solomon, which would have undermined Adonijah's attempt to secure the throne. Benaiah's later role in executing justice on behalf of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25, 34</a>) underscores his importance in the transition of power.<p><b>the mighty men</b><br>David's mighty men were a group of elite warriors who had been with him through many battles (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a>). Their loyalty to David and his chosen successor was well-known. By not inviting them, Adonijah was attempting to avoid opposition from those who had been instrumental in establishing and maintaining David's kingdom. This exclusion highlights the division within the kingdom and the political maneuvering taking place.<p><b>or his brother Solomon</b><br>Solomon, the son of David and Bathsheba, was the divinely appointed successor to David's throne (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). His exclusion from Adonijah's feast was a clear indication of Adonijah's intent to usurp the throne. Solomon's eventual anointing and reign fulfilled God's promise to David regarding his lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).

Scripture is literally pointing out that something crucial is missing amid all the celebration. The &#8220;but&#8221; reminds us how often human schemes run contrary to God&#8217;s plan&#8212;just as <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a> declares, &#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the Lord will prevail.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he did not invite Nathan the prophet</b><p>Nathan had been God&#8217;s faithful spokesman to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>). Adonijah&#8217;s snub is intentional. By excluding the prophet, he is refusing divine accountability, repeating the folly of King Saul, who brushed aside Samuel&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-26</a>). When leaders silence God&#8217;s voice, they place themselves outside His blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Benaiah</b><p>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, commander of David&#8217;s bodyguard (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20-23</a>), was fiercely loyal to the throne&#8217;s rightful line. Leaving him off the guest list is strategic: Adonijah knows Benaiah will defend God-ordained succession. Later, Solomon promotes Benaiah to lead the army in place of Joab (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>), proving this warrior&#8217;s unwavering fidelity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the mighty men</b><p>These are David&#8217;s elite soldiers, men like Eleazar and Shammah (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-10.htm">1 Chronicles 11:10-12</a>). They had stood with David through every hardship, so Adonijah must keep them away lest they rally behind Solomon. The omission underscores how illegitimate power grabs avoid those who value covenant loyalty over political expediency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or his brother Solomon.</b><p>Solomon is the God-designated heir (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). Excluding him exposes Adonijah&#8217;s true aim: seize the crown without confrontation. It mirrors the hostility Cain showed Abel when he perceived God&#8217;s favor on his brother (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a>). Yet God&#8217;s sovereign choice cannot be thwarted; Solomon will sit on the throne by day&#8217;s end (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every name left off Adonijah&#8217;s guest list spotlights hearts aligned with God&#8217;s revealed will. By shutting them out, Adonijah isolates himself from prophetic truth, loyal counsel, proven valor, and the rightful heir. <a href="/1_kings/1-10.htm">1 Kings 1:10</a> therefore warns that any plan built on exclusion of God&#8217;s chosen servants is doomed, while His purposes stand firm for those who honor His word and order.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</span> [It is clear from this verse that Adonijah perfectly understood that he had in Solomon a rival. The intentions and promises (ver. 13) of his father can hardly have been unknown to him. The name "Jedidiah, too, bestowed upon Solomon by Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), taken in connexion with the prophecy of Nathan (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 2 Samuel 7:12; cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), must have proved to him that Solomon was marked out for David's successor. He seems to have been well aware also who were Solomon's supporters. To some of them he may have made indirect overtures. The historian having recorded Adonijah's preparations for a <span class="accented">coup d'etat</span>, now relates the manner in which the plot was frustrated. The prophet, who had been the guardian and preceptor of Solomon's youth, and who knew the Divine will respecting the succession (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9, 10</a>), takes prompt and energetic measures to defeat the conspiracy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
