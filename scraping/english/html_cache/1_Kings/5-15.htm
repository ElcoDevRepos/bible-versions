The use of 70,000 porters, or laborers, indicates the logistical complexity and the massive human resources required. This workforce was likely composed of non-Israelite laborers, possibly Canaanites or other subjugated peoples, reflecting the socio-political dynamics of the time. The number also underscores Solomon's wealth and the kingdom's prosperity, as such a large labor force would require substantial resources to maintain. This aligns with the biblical narrative of Solomon's reign as a period of peace and prosperity, allowing for such grand projects.<p><b>and 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains</b><br>The mention of 80,000 stonecutters emphasizes the skilled labor necessary for the temple's construction, particularly in quarrying and shaping the stones used in the building. The "mountains" likely refer to the region around Jerusalem, where limestone quarries were abundant. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of such quarries, which would have been essential for providing the high-quality stone needed for the temple. The stonecutters' work was crucial, as the temple was to be a permanent and magnificent dwelling place for God, reflecting His glory and the covenant with Israel. This labor force's size and specialization highlight the temple's importance and the meticulous care taken in its construction, foreshadowing the New Testament's depiction of Jesus as the cornerstone of the spiritual temple, the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

We learn from <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</a> that "all the strangers that were in the land of Israel" were subjected to forced labour by Solomon - there were, that is to say, but 150,000 of them remaining. They occupied a very different position from that of the 30,000 Hebrews. None of the latter were reduced to bondage (<a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>), while the former had long been employed in servile work. The Gibeonites were reduced to serfdom by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), and the rest of the Canaanites as they were conquered (<a href="/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29, 30</a>). In <a href="/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, we find some of them employed on public works by David. By the "hewers" many commentators have supposed that stonecutters alone are intended (so Jos., Ant., 8:02.9) partly because stone is mentioned presently, and partly because <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is mostly used of the quarrying or cutting of stone, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-12.htm">2 Kings 12:12</a>, etc. Gesenius understands the word both of stone and wood cutters. But is it not probable that the latter alone are indicated? That the word is sometimes used of woodcutting <a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a> shows. And the words, "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the mountain"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) almost compel us so to understand it here. "The mountain" must be Lebanon. But surely the <span class="accented">stone</span> was not transported, to any great extent, like the wood, so great a distance over land and sea, especially when it abounded on the spot. (The tradition that the stone was quarried at Baalbek is quite unworthy of credence. It has no doubt sprung from the huge stones found there. "The temple was built of the beautiful white stone of the country, the hard <span class="accented">missal"</span> (Warren, p. 60.) It is true the number of wood cutters would thus appear to be very great, but it is to be remembered how few comparatively were the appliances or machines of those days: almost everything must be done by manual labour. And Pliny tells us that no less than 360,000 men were employed for twenty years on one of the pyramids. It is possible, however, that the huge foundations mentioned below (ver. 17) were brought from Lebanon.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/5-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
