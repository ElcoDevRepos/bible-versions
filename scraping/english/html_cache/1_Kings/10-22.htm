Tarshish is often associated with a distant port, possibly in Spain or the western Mediterranean, known for its wealth and resources. The collaboration with Hiram, king of Tyre, underscores the strong political and economic alliance between Israel and Phoenicia. Tyre was renowned for its seafaring expertise, and this partnership allowed Solomon to expand his influence and wealth. This alliance is also mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>, where Hiram supplies materials for the Temple, indicating a long-standing relationship.<p><b>and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive</b><br>The three-year cycle suggests long voyages, possibly indicating the great distances traveled by these ships. This period allowed for the collection of exotic goods from far-off lands, reflecting the extensive reach of Solomon's trade network. The regularity of these voyages implies a well-organized and prosperous trade system, contributing to the wealth and splendor of Solomon's kingdom, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>.<p><b>bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks</b><br>These items symbolize the opulence and international connections of Solomon's reign. Gold and silver were common measures of wealth and power, while ivory was a luxury item often used in art and decoration. Apes and peacocks, likely imported from Africa or India, represent the exotic and diverse nature of the goods Solomon acquired. This wealth and splendor are seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>, where God grants him riches and honor. The abundance of these goods also prefigures the wealth and glory of the Messianic kingdom, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-9</a>, where the nations bring their wealth to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/ships_of_tarshish.htm">Ships of Tarshish</a></b><br>Large, sea-going vessels associated with long voyages and trade, possibly referring to a specific type of ship or a fleet from a region known for its wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The king of Tyre, an ally of Solomon, who provided materials and skilled labor for the construction of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tarshish.htm">Tarshish</a></b><br>A distant port or region, possibly located in the western Mediterranean, known for its wealth and trade.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trade_goods.htm">Trade Goods</a></b><br>Gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks, symbolizing the wealth and exotic nature of Solomon's trade network.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_blessing.htm">God's Provision and Blessing</a></b><br>Solomon's wealth and trade success are seen as a blessing from God, reflecting His provision for those who follow Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_stewardship.htm">Wisdom in Stewardship</a></b><br>Solomon's ability to manage vast resources and trade networks demonstrates the importance of wisdom in stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_wealth.htm">The Danger of Wealth</a></b><br>While wealth can be a blessing, it also poses spiritual dangers, as seen later in Solomon's life when his heart turns away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_influence_and_responsibility.htm">Global Influence and Responsibility</a></b><br>Solomon's international trade highlights the potential for God's people to influence the world positively, but also the responsibility that comes with such influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_riches.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Riches</a></b><br>Despite Solomon's wealth, it serves as a reminder that earthly riches are temporary and should not be our ultimate pursuit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_10_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 10:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_10_22_Solomon_s_divine_wealth.htm">How does 1 Kings 10:22 illustrate God's blessing on Solomon's reign?

For (<span class= "ital">a</span>) Tarshish is first noted in <a href="/genesis/10-4.htm" title="And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.">Genesis 10:4</a> as among the descendants of Javan, the son of Japhet, which probably points to a European position; (<span class= "ital">b</span>) in some other places (<a href="/isaiah/23-1.htm" title="The burden of Tyre.

Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you of the evil.">Jonah 4:2</a>, we gather that it was on the Mediterranean Sea; (d) the silver, which was evidently the chief import by this navy of Tarshish, was in ancient times found in large quantities in Spain, as also "the iron, lead, and tin," mentioned with the silver in <a href="/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>. But the phrase "ships of Tarshish" appears to have become a technical phrase for ships of large size (see <a href="/isaiah/2-17.htm" title="And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.">Isaiah 2:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm" title="Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.">Jeremiah 10:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-8.htm" title="As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
