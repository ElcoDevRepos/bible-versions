The LORD's involvement suggests that the current leadership is not in alignment with His will. Historically, this reflects the pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where God raises leaders to fulfill His purposes, such as Saul, David, and Solomon. The phrase "raise up" often implies a divinely appointed leader, reminiscent of God's selection of David in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>. This king is to be a tool of divine judgment, similar to how God used foreign nations to discipline Israel.<p><b>who will cut off the house of Jeroboam</b><br>The "house of Jeroboam" refers to Jeroboam's dynasty, which was established after the division of the united kingdom of Israel. Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom, led Israel into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). The cutting off of his house signifies the end of his lineage and is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Ahijah the prophet in <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>. This act of cutting off is a common biblical motif for divine judgment against a rebellious house, as seen with the house of Eli in <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-33</a>.<p><b>This is the day&#8212;yes, even today!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the immediacy and certainty of the prophecy's fulfillment. It underscores the urgency of God's judgment and the inevitable nature of His decrees. The repetition "yes, even today" serves to stress that the time for repentance has passed, and the consequences are now at hand. This immediacy can be compared to other instances in scripture where God's judgment is swift and certain, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the prophetic nature of God's word, which is always fulfilled in its appointed time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign and orchestrates the rise and fall of kings according to His divine will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

[Rawlinson only expresses a general feeling when he says that "no satisfactory sense can be obtained from the Hebrew text," and suggests that it is corrupt or defective. The passage, no doubt, is one of extreme difficulty, and inasmuch as the MSS. and Versions lend us no aid to its interpretation, affords scope for conjecture. The explanation I venture to submit may, I hope, contribute - it can hardly do more - to the elucidation of the text. I observe that in ver. 13 <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is used of Abijah, "this one alone," etc. I assume that it has the same import here, viz., "this one today," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "this one dies or is cut off today," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> being understood as constantly, adverbially, - <span class="accented">hodie</span> (see, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>). It would be a natural reflection to the prophet who had just been speaking of the excision of the <span class="accented">house</span> of Jeroboam, "one perishes today, judgment is already begun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> As to the rest, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> I would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, which has practically the same sound, and for which, consequently, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is sometimes substituted by the transcriber, as in <a href="/1_kings/1-18.htm">1 Kings 1:18, 20</a>, and understand "And what wilt thou also do?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, what will become of thee also? It is quite possible (ver. 11) that Jeroboam's wife perished in the wholesale destruction of his house, as it is clear from the severe punishment assigned to her (ver. 12) that she must have shared in his sin. The readiness with which she lent herself to this deceit (ver. 4) also favours the supposition that she had approved his policy. She would then have survived her husband only two years. Keil's explanation, "cut off the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">this</span> day," appears contrary to actual fact, while to interpret "that day" (with the A.V.) is contrary to Hebrew grammar.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moreover, the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will raise up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
