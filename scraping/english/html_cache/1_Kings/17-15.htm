In the context of <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>, Elijah, a prophet of God, had instructed the widow of Zarephath to use her last bit of flour and oil to make bread for him, promising that her supplies would not run out. Her actions demonstrate a profound trust in God's provision, reminiscent of Abraham's faith when he was called to sacrifice Isaac (Genesis 22). The widow's obedience is a testament to the power of faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Her actions also prefigure the New Testament call to trust in God's provision, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>.<p><b>and there was food every day for Elijah and the woman and her household</b><br>This miraculous provision of food is a direct result of the widow's faith and obedience. It echoes the provision of manna for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16), showcasing God's ability to provide for His people in times of need. The continuous supply of food also foreshadows the miracles of Jesus, such as the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where a small amount of food was multiplied to feed many. This event serves as a type of Christ, illustrating God's power to sustain life and His compassion for those who trust in Him. The phrase underscores the theme of divine provision and the blessings that follow obedience to God's word, as seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who plays a central role in this account.

First, in this instance, as in the similar miracles of Elisha and of our Lord Himself, we see that God's higher laws of miracle, like the ordinary laws of His providence, admit within their scope the supply of what we should consider as homely and trivial needs--in this respect perhaps contradicting what our expectation would have suggested. Next, that it is a miracle of multiplication, which is virtual creation--not necessarily out of nothing--doing rapidly and directly what, under ordinary laws, has to be done slowly and by indirect process.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah</span> [the echo of ver. 13, "Go and <span class="accented">do according to thy saying"</span>]: and she, and he, [or <span class="accented">he and she</span>, according to Chethib] <span class="cmt_word">and</span> <span class="cmt_word">her house</span> [probably her friends or poor relatives who came to partake of her plenty (Bahr)], <span class="cmt_word">did eat many days.</span> [Heb. days, <span class="accented">i.e., an</span> indefinite period.
