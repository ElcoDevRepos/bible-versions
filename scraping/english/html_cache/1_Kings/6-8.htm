The south side entrance may symbolize openness to the light, as the south side would receive sunlight throughout the day. This architectural detail reflects the temple's design, which was intended to be both functional and symbolic. The temple's construction followed specific divine instructions, emphasizing the importance of order and holiness. The south side entrance also suggests a practical design for accessibility and movement within the temple complex. In biblical symbolism, the south can represent warmth and blessing, aligning with the temple's purpose as a place of divine presence.<p><b>A stairway led up to the middle level,</b><br>The stairway signifies a means of ascent, both physically and spiritually. In the context of the temple, it represents the progression towards holiness and the presence of God. The middle level may have served practical purposes, such as storage or housing for temple workers, but it also symbolizes an intermediary stage in the journey towards the divine. The concept of ascending is prevalent in scripture, often associated with drawing nearer to God (e.g., <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>). The stairway can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), providing access to higher spiritual truths.<p><b>and from there to the third floor.</b><br>The third floor represents the highest level within the temple structure, possibly used for more sacred purposes. The number three often holds significance in the Bible, symbolizing completeness and divine perfection (e.g., the Trinity). The progression from the bottom to the third floor can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth and maturity. This ascent mirrors the believer's journey towards a deeper relationship with God. The temple itself is a type of Christ, who embodies the fullness of God and provides believers with access to the divine presence (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). The third floor, as the culmination of the ascent, reflects the ultimate goal of union with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.

The temple&#8217;s outer structure had side rooms (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>) used for storage of temple articles and for priestly service.<p>&#8226; Only those appointed by God could enter; no casual traffic was allowed. This reinforces that access to the holy is regulated by God&#8217;s design, not human preference (cf. <a href="/numbers/18-3.htm">Numbers 18:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes this principle: true access to God is granted only through the way He establishes&#8212;fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was on the south side of the temple</b><p>&#8226; Unlike the main temple entrance, which faced east (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>), these service rooms opened to the south. The text simply records the fact, underscoring the literal accuracy of Scripture.<p>&#8226; Practical reasons: the south exposure allowed better light and protection from prevailing western storms (cf. <a href="/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-24.htm">Matthew 8:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual takeaway: God orders every detail of His house. The very placement of a doorway is planned (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). Believers can trust that He likewise orders the details of their lives (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A stairway led up to the middle level</b><p>&#8226; Instead of separate outside doors for each floor, a single internal stairway connected the levels. This ensured security and controlled movement among the priests (<a href="/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Ezekiel 41:7</a> describes a similar winding stair in Ezekiel&#8217;s temple vision).<p>&#8226; The upward movement pictures growth in service&#8212;priests ascended from basic tasks below to higher duties above. In Christ we, too, &#8220;grow up in all things&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>) and &#8220;press on toward the goal&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The stairway also prevented unclean entry from the outside to upper rooms, mirroring the call to progressive sanctification (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And from there to the third floor</b><p>&#8226; Three levels (bottom, middle, third) provided ample space without enlarging the sacred footprint (<a href="/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>). The pattern teaches stewardship&#8212;maximizing God-given space and resources (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Seven-story ziggurats around Israel flaunted pagan grandeur, but Solomon&#8217;s temple rose only three stories at its outer rooms, keeping attention on the inner sanctuary where God&#8217;s presence dwelled (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10&#8211;11</a>). Our ministries must direct glory to God, not to our structures (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The complete vertical arrangement hints at the fullness of divine provision: &#8220;My God will supply every need&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>), whether on the first floor or the third.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a> records straightforward architectural details, yet every line reveals God&#8217;s precise order. One entrance on the south side, an internal stair, and three connected levels show:<p>&#8226; Access to God is on His terms.<p>&#8226; He plans even the smallest structural feature.<p>&#8226; Service to Him involves upward, progressive growth.<p>&#8226; All design ultimately directs glory to His dwelling presence, not to human craftsmanship. Trusting the literal accuracy of Scripture, we see that even a verse about doors and stairs points our hearts to the ordered, purposeful, and gracious character of the Lord who dwells among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - After recording this interesting and singular fact, the historian resumes his description of the side building. <span class="cmt_word">The door</span> [or entrance, doorway, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, as in ver. 31] <span class="cmt_word">for</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">of</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the middle chamber</span> [generally understood to mean "the middle side chamber of the lower story."

Bahr says this "must necessarily be read." That this emendation has much in its favour must be allowed, but it seems also certain that we get a perfectly clear meaning from the text as it stands, viz., that "the door (leading to) the middle floor was (on the ground floor) on the right side," etc. It is hardly likely that all the compartments on the ground floor had only one approach, and the doors which communicated with them may well have been passed over as requiring no special notice.
