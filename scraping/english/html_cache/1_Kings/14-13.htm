In ancient Israel, mourning was a communal activity, often involving lamentation and specific mourning rituals. The fact that "all Israel" will mourn implies that the person held a position of respect or affection among the people. This is notable given the context of Jeroboam's reign, which was marked by idolatry and division. The act of burial is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, as it was a sign of honor and respect. Proper burial was important in Israelite culture, reflecting one's status and the community's regard for the deceased.<p><b>For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial,</b><br>This statement highlights the judgment upon Jeroboam's house. Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, led the people into idolatry, which brought divine disfavor. The promise of a proper burial for only one member of his family underscores the severity of God's judgment. In the ancient world, not receiving a proper burial was considered a curse and a sign of disgrace. This prophecy serves as a stark contrast to the fate of the rest of Jeroboam's lineage, emphasizing the unique favor shown to this individual.<p><b>because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam.</b><br>This phrase reveals the divine perspective on the moral and spiritual state of Jeroboam's family. Despite the widespread corruption and idolatry, God acknowledges the presence of good in this one individual. This echoes the biblical theme of God's ability to discern the heart and recognize righteousness even in the midst of a corrupt environment. The mention of "the LORD, the God of Israel" reinforces the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the divine authority behind the judgment and the recognition of good. This individual can be seen as a type of Christ, representing righteousness and favor in a fallen world, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus, who embodies perfect goodness and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Though the nation followed Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry, they still sensed Abijah&#8217;s worth and felt genuine grief.<p>&#8226; Public mourning shows Abijah&#8217;s reputation; unlike his father, he evidently treated people well and honored the Lord internally. Compare the widespread lament for Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>) or for godly kings such as Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-33.htm">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>).<p>&#8226; A proper burial signified respect, rest, and hope of resurrection (<a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25-26</a>; <a href="/acts/13-36.htm">Acts 13:36</a>). God highlights that even an apostate nation can recognize true character when it sees it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial</b><p>&#8226; This clause contrasts Abijah&#8217;s honorable end with the disgrace awaiting the rest of Jeroboam&#8217;s dynasty: &#8220;Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal of burial was a covenant curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>) and later befell Jezebel&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>).

Abijah&#8217;s honorable burial and national mourning highlight God&#8217;s mercy toward the righteous, while the rest of Jeroboam&#8217;s family faces the covenant curses. The verse teaches that personal devotion to the Lord is never lost in the crowd&#8212;His eye is on every individual, rewarding faithfulness and judging sin with perfect fairness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Because in him there is found some good thing.</span>--There is something singularly pathetic in this declaration of early death, in peace and with due mourning, as the only reward which can be given to piety in the time of coming judgment. It is much like the prophetic declaration to Josiah at the time of the approaching fall of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-18.htm" title="But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;">2Kings 22:18-20</a>). But, at the same time, we find in the Old Testament little indication of that general view of the prevalent sorrow and burden of life, which makes Herodotus, in his celebrated story of Cleobis and Bito (Book 1:100:31), imply that at all times early death is Heaven's choicest blessing. Such a view, indeed, is expressed in such passages as <a href="/context/job/3-11.htm" title="Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?">Job 3:11-22</a>, <a href="/context/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm" title="So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.">Ecclesiastes 4:1-3</a>; but these are clearly exceptional. Life is viewed--sometimes, as in <a href="/context/psalms/88-10.htm" title="Will you show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise you? Selah.">Psalm 88:10-12</a>, <a href="/context/isaiah/38-18.htm" title="For the grave cannot praise you, death can not celebrate you: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for your truth.">Isaiah 38:18-19</a>, even in contrast with the unseen world--as a place of God's favour and blessing, which nothing but man's wilful sin can turn to sorrow. The presence and the penalty of sin are recognised from the day of the Fall onwards, yet as only impairing, and not destroying, man's natural heritage of joy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an Israel shall mourn for him</span> [no doubt he was heir to the throne] <span class="cmt_word">and bury him</span> [mentioned to heighten the contrast.
