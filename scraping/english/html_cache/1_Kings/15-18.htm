In response, Asa took a pragmatic approach by using the wealth stored in the temple and the royal palace. The treasuries of the house of the LORD were initially filled by Solomon, who amassed great wealth for the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>). This act of withdrawing sacred funds indicates the severity of the situation Asa faced. It also reflects a pattern seen in other biblical accounts where temple treasures were used in times of crisis (<a href="/2_kings/12-18.htm">2 Kings 12:18</a>). The use of these treasures highlights the tension between faith in divine provision and reliance on political alliances.<p><b>He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with this message to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus:</b><br>Asa's decision to send the treasures to Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, underscores the political dynamics of the region. Aram, with its capital in Damascus, was a significant power in the Near East. By forming an alliance with Ben-hadad, Asa sought to counter the threat from Israel. This move reflects the complex alliances and enmities among the kingdoms surrounding Israel and Judah. Ben-hadad's lineage, mentioned here, connects him to a line of Aramean kings, indicating a stable dynasty. The political maneuvering here is reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought foreign alliances, such as Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>) and Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>).

Though the tactic works militarily (<a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20-22</a>), Scripture judges it a lapse of faith (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>). The verse exposes the danger of converting what is consecrated to God into currency for human schemes and reminds readers that true security lies not in political maneuvering but in steadfast reliance on the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Sent them to Ben-hadad.</span>--This shows that Syria, recovering its independence at the fall of Solomon's empire, was already attaining the formidable power, which so soon threatened to destroy Israel altogether. The Ben-hadad of the text is the grandson of Hezion, who must be the Rezon of <a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:">1Kings 11:23</a>. Already, as we gather from the next verse, there had been leagues between Syria and Judah in the preceding reign. Now it is clear that Baasha had attempted to supersede these by a closer league--possibly, like Pekah in later times (<a href="/context/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5-6</a>), desiring to strengthen and secure himself against invasion by the subjugation of Judah. Asa naturally resolved to bribe Ben-hadad by presents to prefer the old tie to the new; but he went beyond this, and proposed a combined attack on Israel, for the first time calling in a heathen power against his "brethren, the children of Israel." It was an expedient which, though it succeeded for its immediate purpose, yet both as a desperate policy and an unfaithfulness to the brotherhood, which, in spite of separation and corruption, still bound the two kingdoms in the covenant of God with Abraham, deserved and received prophetic rebuke. (See <a href="/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-9</a>.) Just so Isaiah, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah, denounced the vain trust in confederacies with the neighbouring nations and alliance with Egypt (<a href="/context/isaiah/30-1.htm" title="Woe to the rebellious children, said the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:">Isaiah 30:1-17</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left</span> [LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>, which Rawlinson thinks points to a corruption of our text.
