It was a period marked by Solomon's departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh, leading to the rise of adversaries and internal strife. The timing is significant as it sets the stage for the division of the kingdom, a pivotal moment in Israel's history.<p><b>the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite</b><br>Ahijah was a prophet from Shiloh, a town with historical significance as the location of the Tabernacle before the temple was built in Jerusalem. Prophets played crucial roles as God's messengers, often delivering messages of judgment or future events. Ahijah's role here is to convey God's plan for the division of the kingdom, highlighting the prophetic tradition of speaking truth to power.<p><b>met Jeroboam on the road</b><br>Jeroboam was an official under King Solomon, known for his industrious nature. This meeting on the road signifies a divine appointment, as God often uses seemingly ordinary circumstances to reveal His will. The road symbolizes a journey or transition, both physically for Jeroboam and metaphorically for the nation of Israel.<p><b>as he was going out of Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, represents the established order under Solomon. Jeroboam's departure from the city foreshadows his future role in leading the northern tribes away from the Davidic rule centered in Jerusalem. This movement away from the city is symbolic of the impending division.<p><b>Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak</b><br>The new cloak represents something fresh or unspoiled, symbolizing the new beginning for Jeroboam and the northern tribes. In biblical symbolism, garments often represent authority or identity. Ahijah's cloak is a prophetic symbol of the new leadership and kingdom that Jeroboam will assume.<p><b>and the two of them were alone in the open field</b><br>The setting of an open field suggests a place away from the prying eyes of the court, allowing for a private and significant prophetic encounter. This solitude emphasizes the personal nature of God's call to Jeroboam and the gravity of the message being delivered. The open field can also symbolize a place of decision and revelation, akin to other biblical encounters with God in wilderness or isolated settings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>A servant of King Solomon who later becomes the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel.
