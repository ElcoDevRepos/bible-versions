His primary sin was the establishment of golden calves at Bethel and Dan, which he set up as alternative worship centers to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem. This act of idolatry is a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). Jeroboam's actions set a precedent for future kings of Israel, who continued in idolatry, leading to the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom.<p><b>and had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam's influence extended beyond his personal sin; he led the entire nation into idolatry. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders have a significant impact on the spiritual direction of their people (<a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>). The sin of idolatry became entrenched in Israel's culture, affecting generations. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of sin and the responsibility of leaders to guide their people in righteousness.<p><b>and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger</b><br>The provocation of the LORD refers to the repeated and deliberate disobedience to God's commandments. In the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>). Jeroboam's actions were not just a personal affront but a national rebellion against God's established order. This provocation led to divine judgment, as seen in the eventual destruction of the northern kingdom by Assyria in 722 BC. The phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the reality of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The verse explains why God allowed such sweeping judgment: &#8220;because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he had provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger&#8221;.<p>&#8226; After Solomon&#8217;s reign, the kingdom split (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeroboam, first king of the north, re-engineered Israel&#8217;s worship to keep people from traveling to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already foretold the downfall of Jeroboam&#8217;s house through the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>).
