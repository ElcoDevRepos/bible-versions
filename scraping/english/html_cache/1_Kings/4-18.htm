The name Shimei means "renowned" or "famous." In this context, Shimei son of Ela is one of the twelve officials appointed by King Solomon to provide provisions for the king and his household. This reflects the administrative organization and the division of labor in Solomon's kingdom, which was known for its wisdom and prosperity. The mention of Shimei here is distinct from the Shimei who cursed David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>), highlighting the commonality of the name and the importance of distinguishing individuals by their lineage or location.<p><b>in Benjamin</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel. Geographically, the territory of Benjamin was located between the tribes of Judah and Ephraim, encompassing significant cities such as Jerusalem, Jericho, and Gibeah. This region was strategically important due to its location and fertile land. Historically, the tribe of Benjamin played a crucial role in Israel's history, producing the first king, Saul, and later being part of the Southern Kingdom of Judah after the division of the united monarchy. The inclusion of a Benjamite in Solomon's administration underscores the integration and unity of the tribes under his rule. Additionally, the Apostle Paul, a significant figure in the New Testament, was also from the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>), illustrating the tribe's lasting legacy in biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shimei.htm">Shimei</a></b><br>A governor appointed by King Solomon, responsible for the region of Benjamin.
