These groups were not fully driven out by the Israelites during the conquest of the Promised Land under Joshua. The presence of these descendants highlights the incomplete obedience of Israel to God's command to fully possess the land (<a href="/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13:1-6</a>). Their continued presence in the land serves as a reminder of Israel's failure to fully carry out God's instructions.<p><b>those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction</b><br>The term "devote to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to completely destroy or consecrate something to God, often through destruction. This was a command given to the Israelites to eliminate the pagan influences that could lead them away from worshiping Yahweh (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). The inability to fully carry out this command resulted in the Israelites coexisting with these groups, which later led to idolatry and other sins (<a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>).<p><b>Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers</b><br>Solomon's use of these descendants as forced laborers reflects the political and economic strategies of his reign. By conscripting them, Solomon was able to undertake massive building projects, including the construction of the Temple and his palace (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>). This practice of forced labor was common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies and demonstrates Solomon's administrative acumen, but it also foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom due to the heavy burdens placed on the people (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p><b>as they are to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates that the practice of using these descendants as laborers continued up to the time the text was written. It suggests a long-standing social and economic structure within Israel that persisted beyond Solomon's reign. This continuity underscores the lasting impact of Solomon's policies and the enduring presence of these non-Israelite groups within the land, which continued to influence Israelite society and religion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, God's chosen people, who were commanded to conquer and settle in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_the_canaanites.htm">Descendants of the Canaanites</a></b><br>The remaining people in the land whom the Israelites did not completely destroy as commanded by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forced_laborers.htm">Forced Laborers</a></b><br>The descendants of the Canaanites who were conscripted by Solomon to work on his building projects.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which the Israelites were to inhabit and purify from pagan influences.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to fully obey God's command to destroy the Canaanites led to long-term consequences.
