The mountain is a place of divine revelation and encounter with God. Elijah, like Moses, is called to stand in the presence of the LORD, signifying a moment of profound spiritual significance and divine communication.<p><b>Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase echoes the experience of Moses in <a href="/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19-22</a>, where God&#8217;s glory passes by Moses. It indicates a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to a human. The anticipation of God&#8217;s presence highlights His sovereignty and the importance of Elijah&#8217;s prophetic mission. It underscores the idea that God reveals Himself in His own way and timing.<p><b>And a great and mighty wind tore into the mountains and shattered the rocks before the LORD,</b><br>The wind represents God&#8217;s power and might, reminiscent of the wind at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and the breath of God in creation (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). In biblical symbolism, wind often signifies the Spirit of God (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). The shattering of rocks demonstrates the overwhelming force of God&#8217;s presence, yet it is a precursor to the revelation that God&#8217;s presence is not always in the dramatic.<p><b>but the LORD was not in the wind.</b><br>This statement emphasizes that God&#8217;s presence is not confined to natural phenomena or displays of power. It challenges the expectation that God is only in the extraordinary, teaching that His presence can be found in the stillness and quietness, as seen later in the passage. It reflects the idea that God&#8217;s ways are not always as humans expect (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>After the wind there was an earthquake,</b><br>Earthquakes in the Bible often signify God&#8217;s presence and action, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>) and at the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). They symbolize God&#8217;s ability to shake the foundations of the earth and human understanding. The earthquake here serves as another demonstration of God&#8217;s power, preparing Elijah for a deeper revelation.<p><b>but the LORD was not in the earthquake.</b><br>This reiterates the lesson that God&#8217;s presence is not limited to grandiose events. It points to the deeper truth that God often speaks in unexpected ways, aligning with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s gentle and personal communication with His people, as seen in the subsequent &#8220;gentle whisper&#8221; or &#8220;still small voice&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>).

The command to stand outside, the promise of God&#8217;s passing, and the successive wind and earthquake reveal that the Lord is sovereign over nature yet chooses how He will speak. By withholding His voice from the violent phenomena, God teaches Elijah&#8212;and us&#8212;to seek His presence not merely in outward force but in obedient listening. This paves the way for the &#8220;gentle whisper&#8221; that follows, reminding every servant that God&#8217;s work is accomplished through His word, His timing, and His methods, not by human expectations of grandeur.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And, behold.</span>--In the LXX., the whole of this verse, couched in the future, is made part of the "word of the Lord." But our version is probably correct.<p>The whole of the vision, which is left to speak for itself, without any explanation or even allusion in the subsequent message to Elijah, is best understood by comparison with two former manifestations at Horeb, to the people and to Moses (<a href="/context/exodus/19-16.htm" title="And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5-8</a>). To the people the Lord had then, been manifested in the signs of visible power, the whirlwind, the earthquake, and the fire--first, because these were the natural clothing of the terrors of the Law, which is the will of God visibly enforced; next, because for such visible manifestations of God, and perhaps for these alone, the hearts of Israel were then prepared. To Moses, in answer to his craving for the impossible vision of the glory of the Lord face to face, the manifestation granted was not of the Divine majesty, but of the "Name of the Lord," "the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth;" for this higher conception of the majesty of God, as shown in righteousness and mercy, Moses, as being the greatest of prophets, could well understand. The vision of Elijah stands out in contrast with the one and in harmony with the other. It disclaims the visible manifestation in power and vengeance, for which he had by implication craved; it implies in "the still small voice"--"the voice (as the LXX. has it) of a light breath"--a manifestation like that expressed plainly to Moses, of the higher power of the Spirit, penetrating to the inmost soul, which the terrors of external power cannot reach. The lesson is simply, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit saith the Lord of hosts" (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>). The prophet so far reads it that he acknowledges, by veiled face of reverence, the presence of the Lord in "the still small voice," yet, with singular truth to nature, he is recorded as repeating, perhaps mechanically, his old complaint.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go forth</span> [The LXX. inserts <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however, is destitute of authority, and was probably inserted from <a href="/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>, to explain the difficulty which the prophet's apparent disregard of this command creates], <span class="cmt_word">and stand upon the mount before the Lord.

An abiding presence, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, was more than man could bear. So Bahr.

The effect of this rearrangement of the text would be that the words, "And behold the Lord passing by," must be taken as a part of the message, "Go forth," etc., and not as a statement of what happened. That statement would then begin with the next words, "And a great and strong wind," etc. But in that case we might have expected "<span class="accented">For</span> behold," etc., or the "And behold" would have come before "a great and strong wind," etc. It is also to be considered - and this seems to me decisive - that the words "rent," "break," etc., are also participles, which it would be unnatural to divorce from the participle preceding], <span class="cmt_word">and a great and strong wind</span> [Such as was net uncommon in that region.
