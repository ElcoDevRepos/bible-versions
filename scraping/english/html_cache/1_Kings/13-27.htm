This prophet's actions and motivations are complex, as he previously deceived the man of God, leading to the latter's disobedience and subsequent death. The presence of his sons indicates a family involved in prophetic activities, which was not uncommon in ancient Israel. Prophets often had disciples or family members who assisted them, as seen with Elisha and the sons of the prophets (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3-5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221;</b><br>Donkeys were common means of transportation in ancient Israel, used by people of various social standings. The request to saddle a donkey indicates urgency and a need for travel, possibly to retrieve the body of the man of God or to fulfill a prophetic duty. The act of saddling a donkey is reminiscent of other biblical narratives, such as Balaam's journey (<a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>) and Jesus' entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-7.htm">Matthew 21:7</a>), where donkeys play a significant role in fulfilling divine purposes.<p><b>So they saddled it,</b><br>The sons' obedience to their father's command reflects the cultural norm of honoring and assisting one's parents, a value deeply embedded in Israelite society (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This action sets the stage for the old prophet's next steps, which are crucial in the unfolding narrative. The saddling of the donkey signifies readiness and preparation for the journey ahead, echoing themes of obedience and service found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An older prophet living in Bethel who deceives the man of God from Judah.

When the old prophet deceived him, the Lord judged the younger prophet, and &#8220;a lion met him on the road and killed him&#8221; (13:24). Much like Saul confessing &#8220;I have sinned; I violated the Lord&#8217;s command&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24-26</a>), the old prophet now faces the results of disobedience in his own household and feels compelled to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The old prophet&#8217;s swift order</b><p>&#8220;Then the old prophet instructed his sons, &#8216;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8217; So they saddled it.&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-27.htm">1 Kings 13:27</a>)<p>Why the urgency?<p>&#8226; A tangible response to the word of the Lord he himself had delivered (13:21-22).<p>&#8226; A desire to recover the prophet&#8217;s body before desecration, reflecting respect for God&#8217;s servant (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognition that delayed obedience is still disobedience (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Family participation in responsibility</b><p>The sons obey without delay, mirroring earlier scenes where children assisted faithful parents&#8212;Isaac helping Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) or the Shunammite woman&#8217;s servant hastening with her donkey (<a href="/2_kings/4-24.htm">2 Kings 4:24-26</a>).
