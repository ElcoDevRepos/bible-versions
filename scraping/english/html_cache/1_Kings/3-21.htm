The act of nursing highlights the maternal bond and responsibility, reflecting the nurturing role of a mother. In ancient Israel, breastfeeding was a critical part of child-rearing, emphasizing the dependency of the child on the mother. This moment underscores the natural routine disrupted by an unexpected tragedy.<p><b>I discovered he was dead.</b><br>The discovery of the child's death introduces a dramatic and emotional turning point. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the death of a child was a profound loss, often seen as a tragedy affecting the entire family and community. This moment of realization is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the ensuing conflict and the need for King Solomon's wisdom. The death also symbolizes the fragility of life and the suddenness with which circumstances can change.<p><b>But when I examined him,</b><br>The act of examination indicates a closer inspection, suggesting that the mother was attentive and discerning. This careful observation is crucial in the narrative, as it leads to the revelation of the truth. In biblical terms, examination often implies a search for truth or understanding, paralleling the spiritual discernment encouraged throughout Scripture.<p><b>I realized that he was not the son I had borne.&#8221;</b><br>This realization is the climax of the mother's discovery, highlighting her intimate knowledge of her child. The phrase underscores the theme of identity and truth, as the mother recognizes the deception. This moment foreshadows the wisdom of Solomon, who later discerns the true mother through a test of love and sacrifice. The narrative reflects the broader biblical theme of truth prevailing over deceit, and the importance of wisdom in discerning right from wrong.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel known for his wisdom, who is presiding over the case.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_women.htm">Two Women</a></b><br>The central figures in this account, both claiming to be the mother of the living child.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The living child who is the subject of the dispute between the two women.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Solomon's court is located, and where this judgment takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_palace.htm">The Palace</a></b><br>The setting of the event, where Solomon hears the case and delivers his wise judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's ability to discern the truth in a difficult situation underscores the importance of seeking God's wisdom in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart's_true_intentions.htm">The Heart's True Intentions</a></b><br>The account reveals how true intentions are often revealed under pressure, encouraging us to examine our own hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>This account illustrates God's justice working through Solomon, reminding us that God is the ultimate judge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discernment.htm">The Role of Discernment</a></b><br>Just as Solomon discerned the true mother, we are called to develop discernment in our spiritual and daily lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_mother's_love.htm">The Power of a Mother's Love</a></b><br>The true mother's willingness to give up her child to save him highlights the sacrificial nature of genuine love.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_3_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 3:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_21_Discernment_s_role.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:21 highlight the importance of discernment in decision-making?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Mother_s_reaction_in_1_Kings_3_21.htm">What can we learn about truth from the mother's reaction in 1 Kings 3:21?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_21_Proverbs_Wisdom_link.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:21 connect to Proverbs' teachings on wisdom?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_1_Kings_3_21_to_daily_conflicts.htm">How can we apply the lesson of 1 Kings 3:21 in daily conflicts?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/God_s_wisdom_in_1_Kings_3_21_disputes.htm">What role does God&#8217;s wisdom play in resolving disputes, as seen in 1 Kings 3:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_21_Divine_wisdom_justice.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:21 challenge our understanding of divine wisdom and justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_21_truth_vs_deception.htm">What does 1 Kings 3:21 reveal about the nature of truth and deception?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_history_on_1_Kings_3_21.htm">How does the historical context of 1 Kings 3:21 influence its interpretation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_solomon_solve_the_mothers'_dispute.htm">How did Solomon resolve the dispute between two mothers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_supports_jeremiah_21's_timeframe.htm">What scientific or historical data supports Jeremiah 21's timeframe and events, given the lack of external records mentioning these specific warnings to King Zedekiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_benjamin's_lineages.htm">In 1 Chronicles 8:1-2, how can these names and lineages of Benjamin be reconciled with variations in other Old Testament genealogies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_jesus_the_firstborn_of_creation.htm">Is Jesus considered the firstborn of creation?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Kings 3:21 Mean</div><b>The next morning</b><p>&#8226;
