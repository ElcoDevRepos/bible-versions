Solomon, the son of David, was known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem. His reign is characterized by stability and the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>Judah and Israel dwelt securely</b><br>The security mentioned here reflects the political stability and peace that marked Solomon's rule. This peace was partly due to Solomon's strategic marriages and alliances, as well as his strong military and administrative organization. The unity of Judah and Israel under Solomon's reign is significant, as it was a time before the eventual division of the kingdom into the northern and southern kingdoms after his death (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>).<p><b>from Dan to Beersheba</b><br>This phrase is a geographical expression used to describe the entire land of Israel, from the northernmost city of Dan to the southernmost city of Beersheba. It signifies the extent of Solomon's rule and the comprehensive peace and security experienced throughout the land. This expression is used multiple times in the Old Testament to denote the full territory of Israel (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p><b>each man under his own vine and his own fig tree</b><br>This imagery symbolizes peace, prosperity, and personal security. The vine and fig tree were common symbols of agricultural abundance and economic stability in ancient Israel. This phrase is also used in other parts of the Bible to describe a time of peace and divine blessing (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>, <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>). It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel regarding the land and their well-being (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>). Additionally, this imagery can be seen as a type of the Messianic kingdom, where ultimate peace and prosperity will be realized under the reign of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

Solomon&#8217;s forty-year reign (<a href="/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>) is framed by God&#8217;s promise of &#8220;rest from all his enemies&#8221; (1 Chron 22:9). The peace described right before our verse&#8212;&#8220;he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates&#8230; and he had peace on all sides&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>)&#8212;shows the Lord fulfilling what He had covenanted with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10-11</a>). This season of tranquility was meant to display God&#8217;s faithfulness and highlight how obedience to His statutes brings blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judah and Israel dwelt securely</b><p>The phrase stresses unity as well as safety. After the turbulence that marked Saul&#8217;s and David&#8217;s early years, the tribes now experience undivided security. God&#8217;s earlier promise, &#8220;Israel shall dwell securely&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/25-18.htm">Leviticus 25:18-19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12, 28</a>), is literally happening. The verse does not picture merely the absence of danger but a settled confidence that the covenant-keeping God is shielding His people (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Dan to Beersheba</b><p>This familiar expression&#8212;used in <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>&#8212;marks the northernmost city (Dan) to the southern border town (Beersheba). It is a shorthand for &#8220;the whole country.&#8221; By including every corner of the land, Scripture underlines that no pocket of the kingdom was left out of this blessing. God&#8217;s promise to Abraham of a broad inheritance (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-17</a>) is now palpably seen from border to border.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each man under his own vine</b><p>The vine was the primary cash crop. Sitting beneath one&#8217;s own vine meant:<p>- Personal ownership&#8212;no oppressive taxation or confiscation (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a> shows how quickly this changed under Rehoboam).<p>- Economic stability&#8212;grapes take years to mature; peace had lasted long enough for vines to flourish.<p>- Enjoyment of God-given fruit&#8212;an echo of covenant blessings such as, &#8220;You will eat the fruit of your vineyard&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>).<p>Prophets later adopt this phrase to picture messianic peace (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), showing Solomon&#8217;s reign as a preview of a still-greater kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his own fig tree</b><p>Figs, another staple (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>), ripen twice a year, symbolizing ongoing provision. The dual mention&#8212;vine and fig tree&#8212;emphasizes both abundance and variety. It also highlights private, family-level contentment. Even Assyria&#8217;s taunt years later admitted that such prosperity was the benchmark of wellbeing (<a href="/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>). In Solomon&#8217;s day, that benchmark was reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a> records the high-water mark of Israel&#8217;s national life&#8212;an era of God-given peace, unity, and prosperity extending to every individual and every border. The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises, showcases the blessings that flow from righteous leadership, and foreshadows the even fuller security and rest ultimately realized in the eternal reign of the greater Son of David.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">Judah and Israel</span> [here we have the copula, the absence of which in ver. 20 suggests a corruption or confusion of the text] <span class="cmt_word">dwelt safely</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">confidently.</span> Cf. <a href="/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>], <span class="cmt_word">every man under his vine and under his fig tree.</span> [A proverbial expression (see <a href="/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>, where it is used by Rabshakeh; <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>) to denote rest and the undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, not necessarily, as Keil, "the most costly products of the land."
