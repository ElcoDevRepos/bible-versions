This act of writing letters signifies the misuse of royal authority and manipulation. In the ancient Near East, letters were a common means of communication, especially for official decrees. Jezebel's actions reflect her influence over Ahab and her willingness to use deceit to achieve her goals. This mirrors the broader theme of corruption and moral decay in Israel during this period.<p><b>Proclaim a fast</b><br>A fast in ancient Israel was often a sign of mourning, repentance, or seeking divine intervention. By proclaiming a fast, Jezebel creates a facade of piety and religious observance. This manipulation of religious practices for personal gain highlights the hypocrisy and moral decline in Israel. Fasts were communal events, and this public display would have drawn significant attention, setting the stage for the subsequent events.<p><b>and give Naboth a seat of honor among the people.</b><br>Naboth, a righteous man who owned a vineyard coveted by Ahab, is given a seat of honor, which is ironic given the plot against him. In ancient Israelite culture, seating arrangements were significant, often indicating status and respect. By placing Naboth in a position of honor, Jezebel sets him up for false accusations, as witnesses would be more credible if the accused was initially honored. This act of deceit is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where the innocent are wrongfully accused, drawing parallels to the trial of Jesus Christ, who was also falsely accused and condemned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her manipulation and idolatry.

By forging royal letters, cloaking her plan in a fast, seating Naboth in honorary prominence, and staging the drama before the townspeople, she turns every good institution&#8212;government, religion, community&#8212;into a weapon for evil. The verse warns that outward righteousness without inner truth breeds corruption, and it calls God&#8217;s people to discernment and courage when systems are manipulated for sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Proclaim a fast.</span>--This might be only to cover all that was to be so foully done with a cloak of religious observance, or, perhaps more probably, to imply that some secret sin had been committed, which would draw down vengeance on the whole city, and so to prepare for the false accusation. There is a like ambiguity as to the explanation of the command, "set Naboth on high," as either an exaltation of pretended honour, or the "lifting up his head" (<a href="/genesis/40-20.htm" title="And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.">Genesis 40:20</a>) for accusation.

It would also accord with the popular idea of retributive justice that Naboth should be denounced in the very hour of his triumph and exaltation.
