His reign is marked by significant religious apostasy, as he established golden calves at Bethel and Dan to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem to worship. This act was a direct violation of the first and second commandments, leading Israel into idolatry. The phrase indicates that the king in question followed the same sinful practices as Jeroboam, perpetuating a legacy of disobedience to God. This sets a pattern of behavior that is condemned throughout the books of Kings.<p><b>and in his sins, which he caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam's sins were not just personal but had national implications. By instituting a false system of worship, he led the entire nation into sin. This highlights the responsibility of leaders and the impact of their actions on their followers. The sins included idolatry and the establishment of unauthorized places of worship, which were contrary to the Mosaic Law. This phrase underscores the collective guilt and the consequences of leading others astray, a theme that resonates with the warnings given to leaders in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger</b><br>The provocation of the LORD indicates a deliberate and sustained rebellion against God's commandments. In the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This phrase reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to divine judgment. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where it serves as a warning of impending judgment unless there is repentance.<p><b>with their worthless idols</b><br>The term "worthless idols" emphasizes the futility and emptiness of worshiping anything other than the one true God. Idolatry is consistently condemned throughout the Bible as it represents a turning away from God to serve created things. The prophets often mocked idols for their inability to see, hear, or act (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the first commandment and the call to exclusive worship of God. It also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of true worship in Jesus Christ, who is the image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>The king of Israel who followed the sinful ways of Jeroboam, leading the nation into idolatry and provoking God's anger.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division, known for establishing idol worship in Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which was led into sin by its kings, particularly through the worship of idols.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The one true God who was provoked to anger by Israel's idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/worthless_idols.htm">Worthless idols</a></b><br>The false gods that Israel worshiped, which were powerless and led the people away from the true God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_following_bad_examples.htm">The Danger of Following Bad Examples</a></b><br>Omri's choice to follow Jeroboam's sinful ways highlights the importance of discerning leadership and the influence of role models.

To say someone &#8220;walked&#8221; in those same ways means he adopted Jeroboam&#8217;s entire program&#8212;golden calves, unauthorized shrines, non-Levitical priests, and a man-made festival. Just as Jeroboam redefined worship to keep people from going to Jerusalem, so Ahab (the &#8220;he&#8221; of verse 26, see <a href="/1_kings/16-29.htm">1 Kings 16:29-30</a>) kept that course. <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-23</a> shows that every northern king who copied Jeroboam ultimately led Israel nearer exile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in his sins</b><p>The verse singles out not merely Jeroboam&#8217;s policies but &#8220;his sins.&#8221; Scripture highlights two: idolatry and misguided leadership. <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a> forbids both other gods and images; Jeroboam violated both.

Ahab thought Baal would secure crops and power, but the ensuing drought under Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) exposed Baal&#8217;s impotence.
