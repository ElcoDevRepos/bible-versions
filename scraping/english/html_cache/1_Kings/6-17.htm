This hall was a place where priests conducted rituals and where the Israelites could gather for worship. The design of the temple, including the main hall, was inspired by the tabernacle, which was a portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The main hall's construction reflects the transition from a temporary to a permanent place of worship, symbolizing stability and the establishment of God's presence among His people.<p><b>in front of this room</b><br>"This room" refers to the inner sanctuary or the Holy of Holies, which was the most sacred part of the temple. The Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant and was separated from the main hall by a veil. Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement. The positioning of the main hall in front of the Holy of Holies signifies the progression from the outer courts to the inner sanctum, representing the journey towards God's presence. This layout is reminiscent of the tabernacle's structure and foreshadows the access to God made possible through Jesus Christ, who is described as our high priest in the New Testament.<p><b>was forty cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, the main hall was approximately 60 feet or 18 meters long. The use of specific measurements in the temple's construction highlights the order and precision that God desired in His dwelling place. The number forty often appears in the Bible, symbolizing periods of testing, trial, or preparation, such as the forty years the Israelites spent in the wilderness. The length of the main hall may also reflect the grandeur and majesty of the temple, emphasizing its importance as a place of worship and a symbol of God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.
