In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the region of Galilee. Hiram's question reflects his dissatisfaction with the quality or value of these towns. The term "my brother" indicates a diplomatic relationship, as alliances were often solidified through familial language. This phrase highlights the importance of mutual respect and fair exchange in ancient Near Eastern treaties. The towns' condition may have been poor, which could explain Hiram's disappointment.<p><b>asked Hiram,</b><br>Hiram was a significant figure in the ancient world, ruling over Tyre, a major Phoenician city known for its wealth and maritime prowess. His collaboration with Solomon underscores the interconnectedness of ancient economies and the importance of trade relationships. Hiram's expertise in timber and craftsmanship was crucial for Solomon's building projects, emphasizing the value of skilled labor and resources in the ancient economy.<p><b>and he called them the Land of Cabul,</b><br>The term "Cabul" is often interpreted as meaning "worthless" or "displeasing," reflecting Hiram's dissatisfaction. This designation may have been a colloquial expression of contempt or disappointment. The naming of places based on events or characteristics was common in biblical times, serving as a lasting reminder of historical interactions. The use of such a term suggests that the towns did not meet Hiram's expectations, possibly due to their poor agricultural potential or strategic insignificance.<p><b>as they are called to this day.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the name "Land of Cabul" persisted over time, suggesting that the narrative had a lasting impact on the region's identity. The enduring nature of the name implies that the story of Hiram's dissatisfaction was well-known and remembered in Israelite history.

After years of generously supplying cedar, cypress, and gold for Solomon&#8217;s temple and palace (<a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>; 9:11), he expected communities of real value.<p>&#8226; The address &#8220;my brother&#8221; underscores the covenant friendship between Hiram and Solomon (cf. <a href="/amos/1-9.htm">Amos 1:9</a>). Even trusted alliances can feel strained when expectations are unmet.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that material exchanges should match the promises made (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>). Integrity in giving honors God and safeguards relationships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>asked Hiram</b><p>&#8226; Hiram does not stay silent. He travels from Tyre to inspect the twenty Galilean towns (<a href="/1_kings/9-12.htm">1 Kings 9:12</a>) and then asks for clarity.<p>&#8226; His inquiry models the wisdom of addressing grievances directly rather than harboring resentment (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon will later write, &#8220;Better is open rebuke than hidden love&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>). Hiram&#8217;s straightforward question fits that principle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he called them the Land of Cabul</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cabul&#8221; sounds like &#8220;good for nothing,&#8221; signaling Hiram&#8217;s negative assessment. The towns were likely undeveloped or agriculturally poor (2 Chron 8:2 notes Solomon later rebuilt them).<p>&#8226; The naming act shows how leaders can label realities from their perspective&#8212;sometimes prematurely. Like Naomi calling herself &#8220;Mara&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>), human labels often reflect temporary discouragement, not God&#8217;s final word.<p>&#8226; God can later redeem what seems worthless; Galilee, once called Cabul, becomes the region where Jesus ministers (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they are called to this day</b><p>&#8226; The phrase roots the narrative in verifiable history. The inspired author affirms that the name endured up to his writing, inviting readers to confirm the record (cf. <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s time-stamped details underscore its reliability. They encourage believers to trust God&#8217;s Word for both past events and future promises (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Even an enduring negative name points to God&#8217;s unfolding plan: what remains &#8220;Cabul&#8221; in the human record can still become precious in His redemptive timetable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hiram&#8217;s disappointed question highlights the importance of integrity in partnerships. His direct inquiry, the labeling of the towns as &#8220;Cabul,&#8221; and the historical note that the name stuck all teach that God&#8217;s people must honor commitments, address disappointments openly, and remember that God can transform what others deem worthless. Centuries later, the same Galilee gains honor through Christ&#8217;s ministry, proving that the Lord&#8217;s purposes prevail even when human expectations falter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Cabul.</span>--The derivation of this word is uncertain. Josephus evidently did not know it as a Hebrew word; for he expressly says, that in the Phaenician language it signifies "what is unpleasing." (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 100:5, sect. 3). A city Cabul is mentioned in <a href="/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27</a>, in the territory of Asher, evidently on the Tyrian frontier, and in the neighbourhood in question. Hiram, it is thought, takes up this name, and applies it to the whole territory, and by a play of words on it signifies his discontent with Solomon's gift. Ewald supposes a Hebrew derivation for the word ("as nought"); others take it to be "like that which vanishes." Either would suit the sense indicated in the text well; but unless these derivations represent something cognate in the Tyrian language, they hardly accord with the requirements of this passage, which (as Josephus says) implies a Phoenician origin for the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What cities</span> are <span class="cmt_word">these which thou hast given me, my brother?</span> [Cf. <a href="/1_kings/20-32.htm">1 Kings 20:32</a>. It would seem, at first sight, as if this form of speech was then, as now, the usage of courts. But the <span class="accented">Fellahin</span> of Palestine, the "modern Canaanites," still address each other as "my father" or "my brother." See Conder, "Tent-work," p. 332]. <span class="cmt_word">And he called them the land of Cabul</span> [The meaning of this word is quite uncertain. The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which shows that they must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>; indeed, it is possible that the words have the same meaning (Gesen.) Stanley (S. and P. p. 364) thinks these cities formed the <span class="accented">boundary</span> between the two kingdoms, and refers to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>, etc. According to Josephus, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, is a Phoenician word, meaning <span class="accented">displeasing</span>; but his etymologies are to be received with caution, and Gesenius justly pronounces this a mere conjecture from the context. Thenius and Ewald regard the word as compounded of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> <span class="accented"> = as nothing</span>; Keil connects it with the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, which would yield the meaning <span class="accented">pawned</span> or <span class="accented">pledged</span>, and hence concludes that, this strip of territory was merely given to Hiram as a security for the repayment of a loan (see below on ver. 14); while Bahr derives it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, an unused root, akin to the preceding - <span class="accented">vinxit, constrinxit</span>, and would see in it a name bestowed on the region because of its <span class="accented">confined</span> geographical position. He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. "How," he asks, "could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (<a href="/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Kabul</span>, eight miles east of Accho (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, "Land and Book," 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the "twenty cities" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day.
