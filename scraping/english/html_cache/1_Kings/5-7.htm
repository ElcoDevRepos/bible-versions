Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its skilled craftsmen and abundant resources, particularly cedar wood. The relationship between Israel and Tyre was mutually beneficial, with Tyre providing materials and expertise for Israel's building projects. This alliance reflects the broader geopolitical landscape of the ancient Near East, where strategic partnerships were crucial for trade and security.<p><b>he rejoiced greatly</b><br>Hiram's joy upon receiving Solomon's message indicates the strength and positivity of the relationship between the two kingdoms. This joy can be seen as a fulfillment of the peaceful and prosperous reign that Solomon was known for, as prophesied in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>. The rejoicing also underscores the importance of wisdom and understanding in leadership, which Solomon was renowned for, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD this day!</b><br>Hiram's blessing of the LORD, the God of Israel, is significant as it shows recognition and respect for the God of Israel by a foreign king. This acknowledgment can be seen as a testament to the influence and reputation of Israel under Solomon's rule. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/47-8.htm">Psalm 47:8</a>.<p><b>He has given David a wise son</b><br>The wisdom of Solomon is a central theme in the biblical narrative, highlighted in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, where God grants Solomon unparalleled wisdom. This wisdom is not only intellectual but also practical, enabling Solomon to govern effectively and maintain peace. The reference to David emphasizes the continuity of God's promises to David's lineage, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises to establish David's throne forever.<p><b>over this great people!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "this great people" acknowledges the significance and size of the nation of Israel. Under Solomon's reign, Israel reached its zenith in terms of territorial expansion, wealth, and influence. This greatness is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, where God promises to make Abraham's descendants a great nation. Solomon's rule is a type of Christ's future reign, where Jesus, the Son of David, will rule over all nations with wisdom and justice, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The king of Tyre, a neighboring kingdom to Israel.

We are not warranted by the expression of the text in concluding that Hiram believed in the exclusive divinity of the God of Israel, or "identified Jehovah with Melkarth his god" (Rawlinson), much less that he was proselyte to the faith of David and Solomon. All that is certain is that he believed the Jehovah as God was quite compatible with the retention of a firm faith in Baa1 and Astarte.
