This phrase indicates the swift transition of power, a common occurrence in the turbulent history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Zimri was a commander of half the chariots under King Elah, Baasha's son, and his rise to power was through assassination, reflecting the instability and frequent coups in Israel's monarchy. The throne symbolizes authority and legitimacy, though Zimri's claim was tenuous and short-lived, lasting only seven days (<a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a>). This rapid change in leadership highlights the political chaos and moral decline during this period.<p><b>he struck down the entire household of Baasha</b><br>Zimri's actions fulfilled the prophecy given by the prophet Jehu against Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>). The complete destruction of Baasha's household was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern politics to eliminate any potential rivals and secure one's position. This act of violence underscores the brutal nature of royal successions in Israel and the fulfillment of divine judgment against Baasha's dynasty for his sins and idolatry. The eradication of a royal family was not only a political move but also seen as a divine retribution for disobedience to God.<p><b>He did not leave a single male, whether a kinsman or friend</b><br>The phrase "not leave a single male" is a hyperbolic expression indicating total annihilation, a practice known as herem, or the ban, which was sometimes commanded by God in the context of holy war (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>). This complete destruction of Baasha's male descendants and associates ensured that no one could claim the throne or seek revenge. The mention of "kinsman or friend" emphasizes the thoroughness of Zimri's purge, reflecting the extreme measures taken to secure power and prevent any future threats. This act of violence is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where entire families were wiped out as a form of divine judgment or political necessity, such as the house of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel who conspired against King Elah, son of Baasha, and became king himself.

There is no pause to consolidate power; judgment falls immediately.<p>&#8226; This haste mirrors how Baasha himself wiped out Jeroboam&#8217;s house the same day he seized the throne (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>). God&#8217;s justice often arrives in the manner sinners have used on others (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The quick fulfillment also underlines the certainty of the earlier prophetic word against Baasha (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>). When the Lord speaks, fulfillment is never in doubt (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was seated on the throne</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures Zimri publicly assuming royal authority&#8212;even though his reign will last only seven days (<a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Sitting on the throne signals legitimacy in the eyes of the people, yet true legitimacy comes only from the Lord who &#8220;removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between the grandeur of the throne and the brevity of Zimri&#8217;s rule reminds us that earthly power is fragile unless rooted in obedience to God (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He struck down the entire household of Baasha</b><p>&#8226; Zimri becomes the human instrument to carry out the sentence God pronounced: &#8220;I will wipe out Baasha and his house&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-3.htm">1 Kings 16:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; While the violence is sobering, it demonstrates that the Lord&#8217;s warnings are not idle. Divine patience is merciful, but it does end (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The thorough judgment also highlights God&#8217;s holiness; sin tolerated for decades finally meets its appointed day (<a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did not leave a single male</b><p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly records total elimination of male heirs as the sign that a dynasty is permanently ended (<a href="/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The completeness prevents any future claimant from reviving Baasha&#8217;s line, ensuring the prophecy cannot be reversed.<p>&#8226; It also reminds us that sin&#8217;s consequences extend beyond the original sinner; families and nations feel the impact (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whether a kinsman or friend</b><p>&#8226; Zimri&#8217;s purge goes beyond blood relatives; it includes political allies.

His immediate action upon taking the throne highlights how surely and decisively the Lord carries out His word. The text warns that ungodly power is fleeting, sin&#8217;s effects are far-reaching, and companionship with evil invites shared ruin. God&#8217;s justice, though sometimes delayed, arrives in full, confirming His sovereignty and the unbreakable reliability of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass when he began to reign, as soon as he sate on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha</span> [see note on ch. 15:29.
