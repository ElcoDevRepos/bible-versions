Solomon's decision to leave the articles unweighed suggests a level of opulence and divine blessing, as the materials were so plentiful that precise accounting was unnecessary. This abundance can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bless Israel under Solomon's rule (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). The unweighed articles also symbolize the overflowing generosity of God, reminiscent of the uncountable stars promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>because there were so many.</b><br>The sheer quantity of bronze articles indicates the extensive building projects undertaken by Solomon, particularly the construction of the temple and his palace. This reflects the grandeur and scale of Solomon's kingdom, which was unmatched in the ancient Near East. The phrase underscores the logistical challenges and the vast resources required for such monumental works. It also points to the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>), as the kingdom's wealth and influence were at their peak during Solomon's reign.<p><b>The weight of the bronze could not be determined.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the immeasurable wealth and resources available to Solomon. The inability to determine the weight of the bronze suggests an overwhelming abundance, aligning with the biblical theme of God's provision beyond human comprehension. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the immeasurable riches found in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>), where the spiritual blessings available to believers are beyond measure. The use of bronze, a durable and valuable material, also signifies strength and permanence, qualities associated with God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and wealth, who oversaw the construction of the temple and other significant projects.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_solomon.htm">Temple of Solomon</a></b><br>The grand temple in Jerusalem, built under Solomon's reign, which served as the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_articles.htm">Bronze Articles</a></b><br>Various items made of bronze used in the temple, including pillars, basins, and other furnishings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman who assisted Solomon by creating many of the bronze works for the temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was constructed, serving as the spiritual and political center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundance.htm">God's Abundance</a></b><br>The unweighed bronze signifies God's provision and abundance.

The historian now pauses to show that Solomon did not bother to record exact totals.<p>&#8211; This signals confidence in God&#8217;s provision.

These latter, as became the furniture of a house which blazed in gold, were all of gold, while the former were of brass. It would seem to be a fair inference, from the omission of Hiram's name, that he was not employed on the manufacture of these latter vessels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon {left}</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these articles</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#234;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
