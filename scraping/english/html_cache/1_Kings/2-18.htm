Her response here indicates her willingness to intercede, showcasing her influence and position within the royal court. Bathsheba's presence in the narrative highlights the importance of maternal figures in biblical history, as seen with other influential women like Sarah and Hannah. Her reply also reflects a diplomatic approach, which was crucial in the political landscape of ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;I will speak to the king for you.&#8221;</b><br>Bathsheba's promise to speak to King Solomon on behalf of Adonijah demonstrates her role as an intermediary. This reflects the cultural practice of using trusted individuals to convey requests to those in authority, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern courts. Bathsheba's willingness to approach Solomon suggests her confidence in her relationship with her son and her understanding of courtly procedures. This moment also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Adonijah, as his request, though seemingly innocent, is politically charged. The narrative underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's promises, as Solomon's reign was ordained by God through David. Bathsheba's intercession can be seen as a type of Christ's mediatory role, as she stands between the petitioner and the king, much like Christ intercedes for believers before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of King Solomon and widow of King David.

<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals her willingness to hear and assist, mirroring earlier models of quick, righteous agreement&#8212;such as David&#8217;s response to Abigail&#8217;s plea in <a href="/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32&#8211;33</a>.<p>&#8226;

Her voice carries weight; the fifth commandment&#8217;s principle of honoring parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) now flows in reverse as a respected mother speaks to her royal son.<p>&#8226;

<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p>&#8226; While Bathsheba promises to present the request, she does not promise its success, showing integrity and submission to Solomon&#8217;s final authority (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22&#8211;33</a>, where Abraham petitions yet rests in God&#8217;s decision).<p>&#8226;
