The "evil" refers to idolatry and practices contrary to the covenant established between God and Israel. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes God's omniscience and His awareness of Judah's actions. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the actions of the people are constantly evaluated against God's standards (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>).<p><b>and by the sins they committed</b><br>The sins mentioned here primarily involve idolatry and the adoption of pagan practices, which were explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This period saw the introduction of foreign gods and the construction of high places, sacred stones, and Asherah poles, which were common in Canaanite worship. The sins of Judah reflect a departure from the worship of Yahweh alone, leading to spiritual corruption.<p><b>they provoked Him to jealous anger</b><br>God's "jealous anger" is a response to Judah's unfaithfulness. In biblical terms, God's jealousy is not like human jealousy; it is a righteous and protective zeal for His people and His covenant. This concept is rooted in the idea that God, as a loving and just deity, demands exclusive devotion (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). The provocation of God's anger is a serious matter, often leading to divine judgment or discipline.<p><b>more than all their fathers had done</b><br>This comparison indicates that the sins of Judah during this time were greater in magnitude or frequency than those of previous generations. It suggests a progressive moral decline, where each generation strayed further from God's commandments. This phrase underscores the seriousness of Judah's actions and serves as a warning of the consequences of continued disobedience. The historical context includes the reign of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, whose leadership saw the division of the united monarchy and increased idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.

Their decline outpaced prior generations, proving that sin accelerates when ignored. The verse is a cautionary snapshot: when God&#8217;s people abandon His word, they invite His corrective anger no matter their heritage or history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Forty and one years old when he began to reign.</span>--It has been noticed that the age of forty-one assigned to Rehoboam at his accession, here and in the Chronicles (both in the Hebrew text and the ancient versions) and in the history of Josephus, presents some difficulty in relation to the youth ascribed to him and his companions at the time of his accession; and, moreover, if only forty years are given to Solomon's reign, must throw back his birth to a time when his father must have been very young. It has been accordingly proposed to read "twenty-one" (by a slight change of the Hebrew numerals); but the combined authority supporting the present reading is strong, and the difficulties above noted, though real, are not insurmountable.<span class= "bld"><p>The city which the Lord did choose.</span>--This emphatic notice is, no doubt, intended to place Jerusalem and its worship in marked contrast with the new capitals and unauthorised sanctuaries which had sprung up. The possession of Jerusalem, with all that was associated with it, was the very life of the little kingdom of Judah, threatened by its more powerful rival and by the neighbouring nations. In Israel one capital succeeded another; Shechem, Tirzah, Samaria, Jezreel, became rival cities. In Judah no city could be for a moment placed on the level of the hallowed city of Jerusalem.<span class= "bld"><p>Naamah an Ammonitess.</span>--The reference to the queen-mother is almost invariable in the annals of the kings, marking the importance always attaching to it in Eastern monarchies; but the mention (here and in <a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm" title="And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.">1Kings 14:31</a>) of Naamah as an Ammonitess is perhaps significant in relation to the description of the manifold idolatries of Rehoboam. It is curious that the succession should pass without question to the son of another and an earlier wife than Solomon's chief queen, the daughter of Pharaoh.<span class= "bld"><p>(22) <span class= "bld">Judah did evil.</span>--From the Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-17.htm" title="So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.">2Chronicles 11:17</a>) we gather that, as might have been expected, the judgment which had fallen upon the house of David for idolatry, the rallying of the national feeling round the sacredness of the Temple, and the influx from Israel of the priests and Levites, produced a temporary reaction: "for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon." With, however, the excitement, and perhaps the sense of danger (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.">2Chronicles 12:1</a>), this wholesome reaction passed by, and gave way to an extraordinarily reckless plunge into abominations of the worst kind. These are ascribed not, as in the case of Solomon and most other kings, to the action of Rehoboam, but to that of the people at large; for the king himself seems to have been weak, unfit for taking the initiative either in good or evil. The apostasy of Judah was evidently the harvest of the deadly seed sown by the commanding influence of Solomon, under whose idolatry the young men had grown up. It is said to have gone beyond "all that their fathers had done," even in the darkest periods of the age of the Judges: perhaps on the ground that the sins of a more advanced state of knowledge and civilisation are, both in their guilt and in their subtlety, worse than the sins of a semi-barbarous age.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord</span> [not, however, before the <span class="accented">fourth</span> year of Rehoboam's reign. For the first three Fears the nation remained steadfast in the faith, and the kingdom was greatly strengthened and consolidated. The defection commenced when Rehoboam began to feel himself secure (<a href="/2_chronicles/12-1.htm">2 Chronicles 12:1</a>). It is to be observed, however, that the historian says "Judah" (not Rehoboam) "did evil," etc. It is probable that a considerable section of the people approved of the idolatrous practices introduced in the preceding reign, and that Rehoboam was unable to repress them. It was his misfortune to have to reap the bitter fruits of Solomon's unfaithfulness], <span class="cmt_word">and they provoked him to jealousy</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">made him jealous</span>.

The words of the covenant proclaimed the Lord a,' jealous God." This is of course anthropomorphic language. The nation was regarded as the bride of Jehovah, and God is said to be made jealous, because idolatry was unfaithfulness to Him.
