The "certain man" is unnamed, emphasizing that God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes. The lack of "special aim" suggests that the outcome was not due to human skill but divine intervention. This aligns with the biblical theme that God directs the course of history, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, which states, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord."<p><b>and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor</b><br>The king of Israel at this time was Ahab, a ruler known for his idolatry and opposition to God's prophets. The phrase "between the joints of his armor" indicates a precise and vulnerable spot, suggesting that despite human defenses, God's will prevails. This incident fulfills the prophecy given by Micaiah earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17-28</a>), where Ahab was warned of his impending doom. The armor, meant for protection, could not prevent God's judgment, illustrating the futility of resisting divine will.<p><b>So the king said to his charioteer, &#8220;Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's command to his charioteer reflects his realization of the severity of his injury. The urgency in his words underscores the fulfillment of Micaiah's prophecy and the inevitability of God's judgment. Historically, chariots were a significant part of ancient warfare, and the king's reliance on his charioteer shows the importance of such roles. Ahab's attempt to retreat from the battle signifies a moment of human vulnerability and the limits of earthly power. This scene foreshadows the ultimate defeat of those who oppose God's plans, as seen in the broader narrative of Scripture, where God's purposes are always accomplished despite human resistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab,_king_of_israel.htm">Ahab, King of Israel</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of God.

(Comp. <a href="/2_kings/5-1.htm" title="Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.">2Kings 5:1</a> : "because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria.")<p><span class= "bld">The driver of his chariot.</span>--In the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments, as subsequently in the Greek of the Homeric days, the war-chariot holds but two, the warrior and the charioteer. This is the first place where the chariot, introduced by Solomon from Egypt (<a href="/1_kings/10-29.htm" title="And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.">1Kings 10:29</a>), is mentioned as actually used in war. (See subsequently, <a href="/2_kings/9-16.htm" title="So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.">2Kings 9:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-21.htm" title="And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.">2Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm" title="And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.">2Kings 23:30</a>; and compare the proverbial expression of this period, "The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof," <a href="/2_kings/2-12.htm" title="And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.">2Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-14.htm" title="Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.">2Kings 13:14</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">a man.</span> It was natural for some of the Rabbins to identify this archer with Naaman - the tradition is found in Josephus. But it is directly contrary to the spirit of the narrative to attempt to identify him. As it was a chance arrow, so it was by an unknown archer] <span class="cmt_word">drew a bow at a venture</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in his simplicity, i.e.</span>, with no intention of shooting Ahab: not knowing what he was doing. That this is the meaning is clear from the use of the words in <a href="/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and smote the king of Israel between the Joints of the harness</span> [The marg., <span class="accented">joints and the breastplate</span>, comes nearer the Hebrew. But it is clear that the rendering <span class="accented">joints</span>, notwithstanding that it has the support of Gesenius and others, is a mistaken one. "In the joints" we can understand, but "between the joints and the coat of mail," gives no sense. It is obvious that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> like <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> following, must signify, some portion of the armour, and the meaning of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> <span class="accented">adhaesit</span>, leads us to conclude that "the hanging skirt of parallel metal plates - hence the plural" - (Bahr) is intended. The coat of mail only covered the breast and ribs. To this a fringe of movable plates of steel was <span class="accented">attached</span> or <span class="accented">fastened</span>, hence called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. So Luther, <span class="accented">Zwischen den Panzer und Hengel</span>. One is reminded here of the Parthian arrow which wrung from Julian the Apostate the dying confession, "Thou hast conquered, O Galilean." Cf. <a href="/psalms/7-13.htm">Psalm 7:13, 14</a>]: <span class="cmt_word">wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand</span> [or, according to the Chethib, <span class="accented">hands</span>. The charioteers of Palestine, like those of Egypt and Assyria, or those of modern Russia, held a rein in each hand. Same expression <a href="/2_kings/9-23.htm">2 Kings 9:23</a>. The meaning is "turn round"] <span class="cmt_word">and carry me Out of the host; for I am wounded,</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">made sick</span>. The king probably felt his wound to be mortal, as a wound in such a part, the abdomen (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>), would be Vulgate, <span class="accented">graviter vulneratus sum</span>. How far an arrow in such a place could penetrate, we may gather from <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>; cf. <a href="/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>. And he was seemingly anxious that the army should not know it, lest would soon discover it if he remained with the <span class="accented">host</span>; he can fight no longer; his wound needs attention; hence this command. It is quite possible that the charioteer, in the din and confusion of battle, may not have observed that his master was wounded. The arrow had not struck any part of the armour.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However, a [certain] man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
