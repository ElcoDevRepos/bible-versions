In the context of <a href="/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, Adonijah, David's son, has declared himself king without David's consent. This situation highlights the importance of divine and royal authority in Israel's monarchy. The phrase underscores the expectation that the king, as God's anointed, should be the one to make such significant decisions. It also reflects the political tension and uncertainty during the transition of power.<p><b>without informing your servant</b><br>Nathan's use of "your servant" indicates his loyalty and service to King David. It also emphasizes the expectation of communication and transparency within the king's court. In the ancient Near Eastern context, prophets often served as advisors to kings, and their role was crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Nathan's inquiry suggests a breach in protocol and the potential for disorder if the king's intentions are not clearly communicated.<p><b>who should sit on the throne</b><br>The question of succession is central to this passage. The throne of Israel is not just a political seat but a symbol of God's covenant with David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David that his lineage will endure. The rightful heir to the throne is a matter of divine promise and national stability. This phrase points to the importance of legitimate succession in maintaining the Davidic line, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as referenced in the genealogies of <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>.<p><b>after my lord the king?</b><br>The phrase "after my lord the king" indicates the concern for the future leadership of Israel. It reflects the uncertainty and potential for conflict during a time of transition. The question of who will succeed David is not only a matter of political importance but also of spiritual significance, as the king is seen as God's chosen leader for His people. This concern for succession is echoed in the broader biblical narrative, where the anticipation of a future king, the Messiah, is a recurring theme.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, whose succession is in question.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A trusted advisor and prophet who plays a crucial role in ensuring Solomon's succession.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of Solomon, who advocates for her son's right to the throne.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>David's son who attempts to claim the throne without his father's approval.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where these events unfold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>God is ultimately in control of leadership transitions.

Her words echo earlier moments when David himself honored Saul as &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). Respect for God-given authority is a hallmark of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). By calling David &#8220;my lord,&#8221; she affirms that the throne still rightly belongs to him, even though he is old and bedridden (<a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase frames the whole request in humility, not accusation&#8212;an approach <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> commends.<p>&#8226; It also signals that Bathsheba trusts God&#8217;s sovereign hand working through David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>let this happen</b><p>&#8220;Let this happen&#8221; points to Adonijah&#8217;s self-coronation (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>). Bathsheba is stunned that such a coup could unfold while the rightful king yet lives.<p>&#8226; Adonijah&#8217;s act mirrors Absalom&#8217;s earlier rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>), showing how unchecked pride breeds disorder (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan for succession was already revealed&#8212;Solomon, not Adonijah (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>)&#8212;so Bathsheba senses something has gone terribly off course.<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights a biblical pattern: human schemes may arise, but &#8220;the counsel of the LORD stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without informing your servant</b><p>Bathsheba stresses the breakdown of communication. In royal courts, a king&#8217;s silence could be mistaken for implicit approval (<a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling herself &#8220;your servant,&#8221; she claims covenant loyalty and signals that David owes truthful guidance to those who serve him (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Good leadership, from family life to national governance, requires clear, honest disclosure (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s earlier failures to confront family issues (as with Amnon and Absalom) make Bathsheba&#8217;s concern urgent (<a href="/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21</a>; 14:24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who should sit on the throne</b><p>The throne is not merely political; it represents God&#8217;s covenant promise to David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11-12</a>). Bathsheba therefore appeals to something far weightier than personal preference.<p>&#8226; David had publicly sworn, &#8220;Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/1-30.htm">1 Kings 1:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records David&#8217;s charge to Solomon to keep God&#8217;s statutes so the dynasty would endure (<a href="/1_kings/2-1.htm">1 Kings 2:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By pointing to the throne, Bathsheba underscores divine order: God chooses, man confirms (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after my lord the king?</b><p>These closing words confront the reality of David&#8217;s approaching death.

She respectfully reminds David that he remains accountable to communicate God&#8217;s revealed choice&#8212;Solomon&#8212;for the throne.
