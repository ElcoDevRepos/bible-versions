Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy following Solomon's reign. His reign is marked by idolatry and the establishment of alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem. The eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign would place the events around 913-911 BC. This period was characterized by political instability and religious apostasy in Israel, which had repercussions for the southern kingdom of Judah as well.<p><b>Abijam became king of Judah</b><br>Abijam, also known as Abijah in some biblical texts, was the son of Rehoboam and the grandson of Solomon. His reign over Judah was relatively short, lasting only three years. The name "Abijam" means "my father is the sea" or "father of the sea," while "Abijah" means "Yahweh is my father," reflecting a possible shift in emphasis or theological perspective. Abijam's reign is noted for continuing the practices of his father Rehoboam, which included idolatry and failure to fully commit to the ways of the Lord. Despite this, God maintained the Davidic line in Judah for the sake of His covenant with David, highlighting the theme of divine faithfulness amidst human failure. Abijam's reign is also a reminder of the ongoing conflict between the northern and southern kingdoms, as he engaged in warfare with Jeroboam throughout his rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Eighteen years have passed since Jeroboam took the northern throne (<a href="/1_kings/14-20.htm">1 Kings 14:20</a>). God&#8217;s Word ties events to real dates so we can trace His faithfulness in history. Compare the parallel notice in <a href="/2_chronicles/13-1.htm">2 Chronicles 13:1</a>. Knowing where we are on the timeline helps us see how God&#8217;s covenant purposes move forward despite human failure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the reign</b><p>This phrase reminds us that the divided kingdom operates on two simultaneous calendars&#8212;one in the north, one in the south. By anchoring Judah&#8217;s story to Israel&#8217;s reigning monarch, Scripture lets us track both lines side by side (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; 15:25). The faithful reader can chart how each kingdom fares spiritually over the same span of years.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Jeroboam son of Nebat</b><p>Jeroboam is repeatedly identified as &#8220;son of Nebat,&#8221; the man whose name becomes shorthand for rebellion (<a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>; 15:34). Mentioning him here sets an ominous backdrop: the northern king leads Israel into calf worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>), and his idolatry influences the whole era. The text quietly asks, &#8220;Will Judah follow that path or cling to the Lord?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Abijam became king</b><p>Also called Abijah in Chronicles, this grandson of Rehoboam now steps onto Judah&#8217;s throne. His reign is brief&#8212;only three years (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>)&#8212;yet God still keeps David&#8217;s lamp burning through him (<a href="/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13&#8211;16</a>). Even flawed leaders are instruments in preserving the messianic line until the arrival of the true Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1-7.htm">Matthew 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Judah</b><p>Judah carries the covenant promise, the tribe from which Messiah will come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). By stating &#8220;of Judah,&#8221; the writer distinguishes Abijam&#8217;s kingdom from Jeroboam&#8217;s apostate realm. The contrast underscores God&#8217;s unbroken commitment to David&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>) and invites us to trace that royal thread all the way to Christ (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-1.htm">1 Kings 15:1</a> is more than a date stamp. It situates Abijam&#8217;s short rule within God&#8217;s grand timeline, contrasts Judah&#8217;s covenant destiny with Israel&#8217;s idolatry, and testifies that even in turbulent days the Lord faithfully advances His plan for the line of David, pointing our eyes ultimately to Jesus, the rightful King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Abijam.</span>--The form of the name given in 2 Chronicles 13, "Abijah," is probably correct, as having a more distinct significance.
