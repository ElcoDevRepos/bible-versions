His reply is significant as it reflects his obedience to God's command. The man of God is unnamed, emphasizing his role as a messenger rather than his personal identity. This anonymity can be seen as a reminder that the message is more important than the messenger, a theme consistent throughout Scripture.<p><b>I cannot go home with you</b><br>The refusal to return with the old prophet highlights the man of God's commitment to the divine instructions he received. This reflects the biblical principle of obedience to God's word over human persuasion. The context here is crucial: the man of God had been explicitly commanded by God not to eat bread or drink water in Bethel, nor return by the way he came (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>). This command underscores the seriousness of his mission and the need for separation from the idolatrous practices in Bethel.<p><b>and I will not eat bread or drink water with you</b><br>Eating and drinking in the ancient Near East were acts of fellowship and covenant-making. By refusing to eat or drink, the man of God maintains his separation from the idolatrous practices of the northern kingdom under King Jeroboam. This act of refusal can be seen as a prophetic symbol of judgment against the false worship established in Bethel. It also echoes the Nazarite vow of abstaining from certain foods and drinks as a sign of dedication to God (<a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>).<p><b>in this place</b><br>The phrase "in this place" refers to Bethel, a significant location in Israel's history. Bethel, meaning "house of God," was originally a place of worship established by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). However, under Jeroboam, it became a center of idolatry with the establishment of a golden calf (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The man of God's refusal to eat or drink there signifies a rejection of the corrupted worship practices and serves as a prophetic act against the apostasy of the northern kingdom. This highlights the theme of faithfulness to God's covenant despite cultural and religious pressures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.

His response models prompt obedience, echoing defenders of truth like Elijah before the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>) and Peter before the Sanhedrin (&#8220;We must obey God rather than men,&#8221; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>). The instant reply underscores that God&#8217;s Word carries final authority over human persuasion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I cannot go home with you</b><p>The phrase reveals deliberate refusal of fellowship that would compromise his mission. Separation at times protects one&#8217;s calling (cf. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>). This prophet was sent to confront idolatry in Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1&#8211;3</a>); returning to a local home could imply acceptance of their syncretism. Like Nehemiah declining Sanballat&#8217;s invite (&#8220;I am doing a great work and cannot come down,&#8221; <a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>), the man of God stays focused.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not eat bread</b><p>Bread symbolizes covenantal hospitality (<a href="/genesis/18-5.htm">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>). Refusal shows he must not share in the idolatrous community&#8217;s table, reflecting later NT cautions against table&#8208;fellowship that blurs distinction between light and darkness (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>). God had explicitly charged him, &#8220;You shall eat no bread&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>), testing single&#8208;minded obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or drink water with you</b><p>Adding water stresses total abstention; even the most basic refreshment is off limits. Elijah likewise went without typical provision during his divinely ordered isolation at Cherith (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3&#8211;6</a>). The strictness reminds us that partial obedience is disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>). God&#8217;s boundaries, however inconvenient, safeguard holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in this place</b><p>&#8220;Place&#8221; refers to Bethel, newly corrupted by Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calf (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;33</a>). God&#8217;s prophet distances himself from a contaminated worship center, just as faithful Jews later distanced themselves from Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/50-8.htm">Jeremiah 50:8</a>) and believers from spiritual Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>. Location matters when it comes to allegiance: where idolatry rules, God&#8217;s servants must stand apart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-16.htm">1 Kings 13:16</a> portrays unwavering commitment to God&#8217;s explicit command. The prophet&#8217;s quick refusal to join the old prophet underscores that divine directives rank above social courtesy, physical need, or cultural expectation. Scripture highlights: decisive obedience, holy separation, and fidelity to mission&#8212;even at personal cost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I may not</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">am not able</span> to] <span class="cmt_word">return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place.</span> [The translation "<span class="accented">in that place"</span> adopted by Wordsworth (after the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in loco isto</span>) does not agree with the Hebrew.
