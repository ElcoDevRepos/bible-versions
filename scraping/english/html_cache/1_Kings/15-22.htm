By summoning all the men of Judah, Asa demonstrates decisive leadership and unity among his people. This action reflects the communal responsibility and collective effort required in times of national crisis. The phrase "with no exceptions" underscores the urgency and importance of the task, indicating that every able-bodied man was needed, highlighting the severity of the threat posed by Baasha, king of Israel.<p><b>and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building</b><br>Ramah was a strategic city located near the border of Israel and Judah. Baasha, king of Israel, had fortified Ramah to control access to Judah, effectively blockading Asa's kingdom. By dismantling Baasha's fortifications, Asa not only removed a military threat but also reclaimed resources for his own use. The stones and timbers represent the physical manifestation of Baasha's aggression, and their removal signifies a reversal of fortune and a divine favor upon Asa's reign. This act of dismantling and repurposing enemy resources is reminiscent of God's provision and the theme of turning curses into blessings.<p><b>And with these materials King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah</b><br>Geba and Mizpah were significant locations within the territory of Benjamin, a tribe closely allied with Judah. By fortifying these cities, Asa strengthens his kingdom's defenses and secures his northern border against future incursions. Geba, mentioned in <a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>, was a Levitical city, indicating its religious importance. Mizpah, a site of assembly and judgment (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>), held historical and spiritual significance as a place where Israel gathered for important decisions. Asa's actions not only have military implications but also reinforce the spiritual and communal identity of Judah. This strategic use of resources reflects wisdom and foresight, aligning with the biblical principle of stewardship and the importance of securing one's inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_asa.htm">King Asa</a></b><br>The third king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.

The Mizpah here referred to--for there were many places so called--a city of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-26.htm" title="And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,">Joshua 18:26</a>), famous in the earlier history (see <a href="/context/1_samuel/7-5.htm" title="And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.">1Samuel 7:5-13</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/10-17.htm" title="And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;">1Samuel 10:17-25</a>), seems to have been situated at the place afterwards called <span class= "ital">Scopim</span> ("the watch-tower"), on "the broad ridge which forms the continuation of the Mount of Olives to the north and east, from which the traveller gains his first view" of Jerusalem (<span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>: MIZPAH).<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then king Asa made a proclamation</span> [Heb. made <span class="accented">all to hear</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>throughout all Judah; none was exempted</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">none free</span>]<span class="accented">,<span class="cmt_word"></span> and they took away</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">took up</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha</span> [It is noticeable that it is generally "king Asa," but never "king Baasha"] <span class="cmt_word">had bullded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin</span> [Sometimes "<span class="accented">the</span> Geba," <span class="accented">i.e., height</span>; in <a href="/joshua/18-24.htm">Joshua 18:24</a>, <span class="accented">Gaba</span>; now <span class="accented">Jeba</span>, only 45' northeast of Ramah. This was the northern limit of the southern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>). It occupied a striking position, standing on a rocky knoll on the south side of the great gorge of Michmash (now known as the <span class="accented">Wady Suweinit</span>), a "great crack or fissure in the country, with vertical precipices some 800 feet high" (Conder, p. 254; cf. Dict. Bib., 1. p. 658 and Porter, 1. p. 214). As Geba would command the pass, it is easy to understand why Asa fortified it, the more so as this defile "appears to have been more than once the meeting place between the Jews and their enemies" (Conder)], <span class="cmt_word">and Mizpah.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Mizpah</span>, <span class="accented">i.e., watch tower</span> (<a href="/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>). The name points to an eminence, but it is remarkable that while so many sites of minor importance have been recovered, this old gathering place of the tribes (<a href="/judges/21-1.htm">Judges 21:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-17.htm">1 Samuel 10:17-25</a>), and the seat of Gedaliah's government (<a href="/jeremiah/40-6.htm">Jeremiah 40:6</a>), cannot be identified with certainty. It has been conjectured that it is now represented by the commanding eminence of <span class="accented">Nebi Samwil</span> (Robinson, 2 p. 328; Van de Velde, 2 p. 53),but Stanley (S. and P., 2. p. 213-4) and Grove (Dict. Bib., 2 p. 389) argue in favour of Seopus, and "the survey has done little to throw light on this question" (see Conder, pp. 257-9). It is to be hoped that the "pit," or well, which Asa made (<a href="/jeremiah/41-9.htm">Jeremiah 41:9</a>), probably "to provide Mizpah with a plentiful supply of water in ease of a siege" (Ewald), may yet be brought to light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/15-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
