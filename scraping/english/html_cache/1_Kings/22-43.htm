Asa was known for his reforms and dedication to the worship of Yahweh, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-14</a>. This phrase highlights the importance of generational faithfulness and the influence of parental guidance in spiritual matters. Jehoshaphat's adherence to Asa's ways signifies a commitment to maintaining the religious and moral standards established by his predecessor.<p><b>he did not turn away from them,</b><br>Jehoshaphat's steadfastness is emphasized here, indicating his unwavering commitment to the path of righteousness. This phrase suggests a consistency in his leadership and personal devotion, which is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-8</a>, where adherence to God's law is encouraged. Jehoshaphat's faithfulness serves as a model for believers to remain true to their convictions despite external pressures.<p><b>but did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores Jehoshaphat's alignment with divine standards rather than human approval. Doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD is a central biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a> and <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Jehoshaphat's actions are evaluated based on God's perspective, highlighting the ultimate authority of divine judgment over human opinion.<p><b>The high places, however, were not removed;</b><br>Despite Jehoshaphat's overall faithfulness, this phrase points to an incomplete reform. The high places were sites of worship that often became centers for idolatry, as mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-11</a>. Their continued existence indicates a lingering compromise in the religious life of Judah. This serves as a reminder of the challenges in eradicating entrenched practices and the need for comprehensive reform in spiritual leadership.<p><b>the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</b><br>This phrase reveals the persistent nature of popular religious practices that were contrary to the centralized worship in Jerusalem. The people's continued use of high places reflects a cultural and religious syncretism that was difficult to overcome. It highlights the tension between official religious policy and popular practice, as seen in the struggle against idolatry throughout Israel's history, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-17.htm">2 Chronicles 33:17</a>.
