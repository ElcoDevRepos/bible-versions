Her influence over Ahab is significant, as she brought with her the worship of Baal, leading Israel further into idolatry. Her character is often associated with manipulation and wickedness, as seen in her actions throughout 1 Kings. Her role in this narrative highlights the dangers of ungodly influence within a marriage, as she encourages Ahab to act against God's commandments.<p><b>&#8220;Do you not reign over Israel?</b><br>Jezebel's question challenges Ahab's authority and responsibility as king. It implies that as the ruler, Ahab has the power to take what he desires, disregarding God's law and the rights of others. This reflects a misunderstanding of true leadership, which according to biblical principles, should be characterized by justice and righteousness (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>). Her words reveal a worldly perspective on power, contrasting with the biblical view that leaders are to serve under God's authority.<p><b>Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful,</b><br>Jezebel's encouragement to Ahab to eat and be cheerful is an attempt to lift his spirits after his disappointment over Naboth's refusal to sell his vineyard. This phrase indicates her dismissive attitude towards the moral and legal implications of the situation. In biblical culture, meals were often associated with fellowship and covenant, yet here, Jezebel uses it to distract Ahab from his conscience and the gravity of his intentions.<p><b>for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.&#8221;</b><br>Jezebel's promise to obtain Naboth's vineyard demonstrates her willingness to use deceit and murder to achieve her goals. This act directly violates the commandments against coveting and murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13, 17</a>). Naboth's vineyard, located in Jezreel, was part of his ancestral inheritance, which according to Levitical law, should not be permanently sold (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>). Jezebel's actions foreshadow the judgment that will come upon her and Ahab's house, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19-24</a>). This narrative also serves as a type of Christ, contrasting the unjust seizure of Naboth's inheritance with Jesus, who willingly laid down His life to secure an eternal inheritance for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and manipulation.

Scripture portrays her repeatedly steering the king toward idolatry and injustice (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). Her intervention here contrasts sharply with the godly counsel a spouse should offer (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10&#8211;12</a>). Instead of directing Ahab toward repentance or contentment, she fuels his covetousness, illustrating the warning that &#8220;bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you not reign over Israel?</b><p>With this rhetorical question Jezebel appeals to royal power, not divine authority. She implies that kingship grants unchecked rights, ignoring the covenant limits God placed on Israel&#8217;s monarchs (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>). By urging Ahab to assert political power over moral law, Jezebel models the same spirit later condemned in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-3</a>&#8212;the nations raging against the Lord&#8217;s rule. Her challenge also echoes Satan&#8217;s temptation to Jesus to grasp authority without obedience (<a href="/luke/4-6.htm">Luke 4:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful</b><p>Jezebel prescribes a quick emotional fix: food and pleasure. Yet true joy comes from righteousness (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>), and stolen pleasures never satisfy (<a href="/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17-18</a>). Her counsel illustrates how sin often masquerades as comfort.<p>&#8226; She treats discontent as a mere mood problem instead of a heart issue rooted in covetousness (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; She urges Ahab to suppress conscience rather than confront it, the opposite of David&#8217;s response when confronted with his own sin (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</b><p>Here Jezebel unveils her plan to seize what God had assigned to another family (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>). Her promise sets in motion a scheme of false witness and murder (<a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8-14</a>), flagrantly breaking the commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13, 15, 16</a>). This moment previews the broader biblical pattern: rulers who disregard God&#8217;s law devastate the vulnerable (<a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). Jezebel&#8217;s words also foreshadow divine justice, for Elijah will soon prophesy her judgment (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23-24</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7</a> shows Jezebel urging Ahab to wield royal power without regard for God&#8217;s law or Naboth&#8217;s rights. Her confident, manipulative promise exposes a heart hardened against the Lord, contrasting with the righteous standard God establishes for leaders. The verse warns that counsel rejecting divine authority may seem effective but ultimately leads to judgment, while reminding believers to seek guidance anchored in God&#8217;s unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Dost thou now.</span>--The scorn of Jezebel is, like the impatience of Lady Macbeth, expressed in a striking boldness of emphasis. First comes the bitter irony of the question, "Dost thou govern the kingdom of Israel, and yet suffer a subject to cross thy will?" expressing her scornful wonder at one who "lets I dare not, wait upon 1 would." Then in the invitation, "eat bread, and let thine heart be merry," there seems the same half-contemptuous recognition of a self-indulgent weakness of nature, which may be traced in Elijah's words in <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm" title="And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.">1Kings 18:41</a>, "Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." Ahab is fit only to desire and to revel; it is for bolder spirits to act for good or for evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jezebel his wife said unto him.

The commentators generally, however, understand the words - as the LXX. and the A.V. - as an ironical question, "Art thou ruler in aught but name?" though some take it as an imperative: "Do thou now exert authority over the kingdom of Israel," And on the whole, this latter interpretation appears to be preferable. "Do thou now play the king. Make thy power felt. Give me the requisite authority. I will," etc.] Arise, and eat bread [or <span class="accented">food</span>], and let thine heart be merry [Heb. <span class="accented">good</span>; same words <a href="/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36</a>]: <span class="accented">I</span> [This word is emphatic.
