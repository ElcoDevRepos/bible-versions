Forsaking God often led to dire consequences for Israel, as seen in the cycles of sin and redemption in the Book of Judges. This forsaking is a breach of the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God declared Himself to be the God of Israel, and they were to be His people.<p><b>to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians</b><br>Ashtoreth, also known as Astarte or Ishtar, was a prominent deity in the ancient Near East, associated with love and war. The Sidonians were a Phoenician people, and their worship practices often included rituals that were abhorrent to the Israelites, such as temple prostitution. The worship of Ashtoreth represents a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods.<p><b>Chemosh the god of the Moabites</b><br>Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites, a people often in conflict with Israel. The worship of Chemosh included practices such as child sacrifice, which were strictly forbidden in Israelite law. The Moabites' worship of Chemosh is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>, where the king of Moab sacrifices his son to gain favor in battle.<p><b>and Milcom the god of the Ammonites</b><br>Milcom, also known as Molech, was worshiped by the Ammonites, another neighboring nation of Israel. Like Chemosh, the worship of Milcom involved detestable practices, including child sacrifice. The presence of Milcom worship in Israel is a sign of the deep spiritual decline during Solomon's reign, as he allowed foreign influences to corrupt the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>They have not walked in My ways</b><br>Walking in God's ways is a metaphor for living according to His commandments and statutes. This phrase underscores the importance of obedience in the covenant relationship. The failure to walk in God's ways often led to judgment and exile, as seen in the later history of Israel and Judah.<p><b>nor done what is right in My eyes</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the moral and ethical standards set by God. Doing what is right in God's eyes is a recurring theme in the Deuteronomic history, which includes the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. It contrasts human judgment with divine standards, highlighting the need for alignment with God's will.<p><b>nor kept My statutes and judgments</b><br>Statutes and judgments refer to the specific laws and decrees given by God to Israel. Keeping these was essential for maintaining the covenant relationship. The failure to keep God's statutes and judgments often resulted in divine discipline, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>as Solomon&#8217;s father David did</b><br>David is often held as the standard for righteous kingship in Israel, despite his own failings. His heart was devoted to God, and he sought forgiveness when he sinned. David's example is frequently cited in the books of Kings and Chronicles as the benchmark for evaluating the kings of Israel and Judah. Solomon's failure to emulate his father's devotion marks a significant turning point in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who turned away from God by allowing idolatry in the kingdom, influenced by his foreign wives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashtoreth.htm">Ashtoreth</a></b><br>A goddess worshiped by the Sidonians, associated with fertility and war, representing the idolatry that Solomon permitted.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/chemosh.htm">Chemosh</a></b><br>The god of Moab, often associated with human sacrifice, highlighting the severity of Israel's idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/milcom.htm">Milcom</a></b><br>The god of the Ammonites, another foreign deity that Solomon allowed to be worshiped, contrary to God's commands.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Solomon's father, who, despite his own failings, is remembered for his heart for God and adherence to God's statutes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Solomon's downfall began with small compromises, such as marrying foreign wives, which led to greater sins like idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_influence_of_relationships.htm">The Influence of Relationships</a></b><br>The people we surround ourselves with can significantly impact our spiritual walk, as seen in Solomon's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God desires obedience to His statutes and judgments, as exemplified by David, despite his imperfections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Turning away from God to serve other gods leads to spiritual and often physical consequences, as seen in Israel's history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_leadership.htm">Legacy and Leadership</a></b><br>Solomon's failure serves as a warning to leaders about the long-term impact of their spiritual decisions on their people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_11_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 11:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_11_33_Consequences_of_disobedience.htm">How does 1 Kings 11:33 highlight the consequences of forsaking God's commandments?
