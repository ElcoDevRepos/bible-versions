His reign is characterized by religious reforms and a commitment to following the ways of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>. The act of making peace is significant in the biblical narrative, as it reflects a desire to avoid conflict and promote unity among the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. This peace can be seen as a strategic move to strengthen political alliances and ensure mutual security against common enemies, such as the Arameans. The concept of peace is central to the biblical message, with Jesus Christ being referred to as the "Prince of Peace" in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, highlighting the ultimate fulfillment of peace through Him.<p><b>with the king of Israel.</b><br>At this time, the king of Israel was Ahab, a ruler known for his idolatry and opposition to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed in <a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>. The alliance between Jehoshaphat and Ahab is a complex one, as it involves both political and familial ties, with Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram marrying Ahab's daughter Athaliah (<a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>). This peace treaty, while politically advantageous, also brings challenges, as it leads to Jehoshaphat's involvement in Ahab's military campaigns, such as the ill-fated battle at Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29-33</a>). The alliance serves as a reminder of the tension between political expediency and spiritual fidelity, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative. The relationship between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah is a recurring theme, with periods of conflict and cooperation, reflecting the broader story of God's people and their journey towards unity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and for his reforms to strengthen the spiritual and military state of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, the king of Israel was Ahab, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of God.

Judah now recognized the division of the kingdom as an accomplished fact, and no longer treated Israel, even theoretically, as in rebellion. It is probable that the marriage of Jehoram and Athaliah was at once the fruit of, and was intended to cement, this good understanding (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>). It is hardly likely (Bahr) that the peace was the result of the union of the two families. From the analogy of <a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>, we should conclude that the marriage at any rate was ill advised and displeasing to God. Bahr sees in it a step on the part of Jehoshaphat towards realizing the union of the two kingdoms under the supremacy of Judah. He thinks that we cannot otherwise account for this complete change of front.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jehoshaphat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1430;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3092.htm">Strong's 3092: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoshaphat -- 'the LORD has judged', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also made peace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;l&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_kings/22-44.htm">1 Kings 22:44 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_kings/22-44.htm">OT History: 1 Kings 22:44 Jehoshaphat made peace with the king (1Ki iKi i Ki 1 Kg 1kg) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Kings 22:43"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 22:43" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_kings/22-45.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Kings 22:45"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Kings 22:45" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
