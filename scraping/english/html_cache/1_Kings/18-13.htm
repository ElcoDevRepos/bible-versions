Obadiah, a devout believer, served in the court of Ahab, king of Israel. His question implies that his loyalty and actions should be known and respected by Elijah. This reflects the tension between serving in a corrupt regime while maintaining personal faithfulness to God.<p><b>when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD?</b><br>Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab, was notorious for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh. Her actions were part of a broader campaign to establish Baal worship in Israel, directly opposing the worship of the LORD. This historical context underscores the danger and hostility faced by the prophets during her reign. Jezebel's actions are a fulfillment of the spiritual conflict between the worship of Yahweh and pagan deities, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD, fifty men per cave,</b><br>Obadiah's courageous act of hiding the prophets demonstrates his commitment to God despite the risks. The use of caves as hiding places is consistent with the geographical landscape of Israel, where natural caves provided refuge. This act of preservation is reminiscent of other biblical figures who protected God's people, such as Rahab hiding the spies in Jericho. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of God preserving a remnant of faithful believers.<p><b>and I provided them with food and water.</b><br>Providing sustenance for the prophets was a significant logistical challenge, especially during a time of drought and famine, as described earlier in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>. This act of provision reflects God's care and sustenance for His people, often using human agents to fulfill His purposes. It parallels the miraculous provision seen in other biblical narratives, such as Elijah being fed by ravens or Jesus feeding the 5,000, highlighting God's ability to provide in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the LORD who served as the palace administrator under King Ahab.

Obadiah&#8217;s testimony has already circulated, suggesting God preserved a witness even in apostate Israel (see <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD?</b><p>&#8226; The backdrop is Jezebel&#8217;s vicious purge of Yahweh&#8217;s prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This is a real, historical persecution showing the spiritual warfare behind Israel&#8217;s drought (<a href="/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>).<p>&#8226;

<a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The number &#8220;hundred&#8221; is concrete, underscoring that these were actual lives preserved, not a vague symbol.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fifty men per cave</b><p>&#8226;

He recalls a documented rescue mission during Jezebel&#8217;s massacre, detailing how he sheltered and sustained one hundred prophets in two caves. Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s preservation of a faithful remnant, the cost of discipleship, and the practical steps believers can take to protect and provide for God&#8217;s servants. The verse ultimately reassures us that the Lord never leaves Himself without witnesses and that obedient courage, even inside hostile systems, plays a vital role in His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord how I hid an hundred men of</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">from</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span> [Stanley happily calls Obadiah "the Sebastian of this Jewish Diocletian."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Was it not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1467;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(hug&#183;ga&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to my lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
