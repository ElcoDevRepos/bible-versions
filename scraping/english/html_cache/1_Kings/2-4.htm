This promise is found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God assures David that his lineage will endure and that his kingdom will be established forever. This covenant is significant as it sets the stage for the messianic expectation, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The fulfillment of God's promises is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His faithfulness and sovereignty.<p><b>&#8216;If your descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me:</b><br>This conditional clause highlights the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God. The requirement for David's descendants to walk faithfully underscores the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Walking faithfully involves adhering to God's commandments and maintaining a heart devoted to Him. This concept is echoed throughout the Old Testament, where the kings of Israel and Judah are often evaluated based on their faithfulness to God.<p><b>with all their heart and soul:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the depth and sincerity of the commitment required from David's descendants. It reflects the Shema, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. This total devotion is a hallmark of true worship and relationship with God. The heart and soul represent the inner being and the seat of emotions and will, indicating that obedience to God is not merely external but involves the entire person.<p><b>you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.&#8217;</b><br>This promise assures the continuity of David's dynasty, contingent upon the faithfulness of his descendants. Historically, this was realized through the line of kings from David to Zedekiah, the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. Theologically, this promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is seen as the eternal King in the line of David (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The assurance of a perpetual throne points to the eternal nature of Christ's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and affirmed in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, who is nearing the end of his life and giving final instructions to his son Solomon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>David's son, who is about to become king and is being charged with maintaining the covenantal promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who made a covenant with David regarding his descendants and the throne.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which David and his descendants are to rule, according to God's promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise God made to David, ensuring that his lineage would continue to rule Israel if they remained faithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_commands.htm">Faithfulness to God's Commands</a></b><br>The promise to David's descendants hinges on their faithfulness.

It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called "precepts of Noah" (<a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (<a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out "by the blood of him that shed it" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too "weak" to discharge (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>).
