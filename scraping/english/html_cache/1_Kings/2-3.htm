The "charge" refers to a solemn responsibility or duty given by God. In the context of 1 Kings, David is instructing Solomon to remain faithful to the covenant relationship with God. This echoes the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is repeatedly called to uphold God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>). The charge is not just a set of rules but a commitment to a relationship with God.<p><b>to walk in His ways</b><br>"Walking" in biblical terms often symbolizes living one's life according to God's will. This phrase suggests a lifestyle of consistent obedience and faithfulness. It is reminiscent of Enoch and Noah, who "walked with God" (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24, 6</a>:9), indicating a close, personal relationship with Him. Walking in God's ways implies aligning one's actions and decisions with His character and purposes.<p><b>and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees</b><br>These terms collectively refer to the comprehensive nature of God's law. "Statutes" and "commandments" are often seen as specific laws given by God, while "ordinances" and "decrees" can refer to broader principles or judgments. This comprehensive list underscores the totality of God's expectations for His people. It reflects the detailed legal and moral code found in the Torah, particularly in books like Leviticus and Deuteronomy, which were intended to guide Israel in holiness and justice.<p><b>as written in the Law of Moses</b><br>The "Law of Moses" refers to the first five books of the Bible, also known as the Pentateuch. These books contain the foundational laws and teachings given to Israel. By referencing the Law of Moses, the text highlights the continuity of God's revelation and the importance of adhering to the divinely given instructions. This connection to Moses also reinforces the legitimacy and authority of the laws, as Moses is a central figure in Israel's history and a type of Christ as a mediator between God and His people.<p><b>so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine blessing as a result of obedience. Prosperity here is not merely material wealth but encompasses success, well-being, and fulfillment in one's endeavors. This promise of prosperity is conditional upon faithfulness to God's commands, a theme prevalent in Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). It reflects the covenantal promise that obedience leads to blessing, while disobedience leads to curses. This principle is also seen in the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, which often links righteous living with prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who is giving his final instructions to his son Solomon.

He is to "show himself a man," in spite of his youth; he is to take heed in all things to follow the Law of the Lord; he is to trust both in the general promise of God to obedience, and in the special promise made to the house of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12-16</a>). It is remarkably in harmony with the beautiful Psalm, "the last words of David," preserved in <a href="/context/2_samuel/23-3.htm" title="The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.">2Samuel 23:3-5</a>, telling how "he that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God," and, in spite of consciousness of shortcomings from this high ideal, trusting in the "everlasting covenant of God" with him, "ordered in all things, and sure." Nor does it accord less with the equally beautiful prayer of <a href="/context/1_chronicles/29-18.htm" title="O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you:">1Chronicles 29:18-19</a>, for Solomon and for the people. In all this David speaks in the spirit of a true servant and saint of God. But in the special charges that follow we see the worldly prudence of the old statesman, and in one case some trace of long-remembered grudge, singularly true to imperfect human nature, although utterly unworthy of an ideal picture of a hero-king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And keep the charge</span> [lit., "watch the watch" (<span class="accented">custodies custodiam Jehovae</span>), or, "serve the service." Bahr paraphrases, "be a true watcher in the service of Jehovah." The words are constantly employed to denote a strict performance of the service of the tabernacle or of the duties of the priests and Levites (<a href="/leviticus/8-35.htm">Leviticus 8:35</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-30.htm">Leviticus 18:30</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7, 8, 25, 28, 32, 38</a>; <a href="/numbers/31-30.htm">Numbers 31:30</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-32.htm">1 Chronicles 23:32</a>, etc.; also <a href="/genesis/26-5.htm">Genesis 26:5</a>). "The reference," says Rawlinson, "is to the charge given to all the kings in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>." But there is no necessity for restricting it to that one injunction. What the charge is is explained presently] <span class="cmt_word">of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways, to keep</span> [same word] <span class="cmt_word">His statutes, and His commandments, and His</span> <span class="cmt_word">judgments, and His testimonies</span> [it is impossible to draw any clear and sharp distinction between these four words, as the older expositors do. "The phrase is derived from the Pentateuch" (Wordsworth). The force of the accumulation of practically synonymous terms is to represent the law in its entirety (<span class="accented">"Die Totalitat des Gesetzes,"</span> Keil); cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-31.htm">Deuteronomy 5:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11</a>, and especially <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>.], <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest prosper.</span> [The marginal rendering, "do wisely," is preferred by some (Keil, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>); but the translation of the text has the authority of Gesenius and others on its side, and gives a better meaning. "The context evidently requires 'prosper' here, as in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>" (Rawlinson). "That thou mayest... <span class="accented">do wisely"</span> is a very lame and impotent conclusion to ver. 3. We have here an evident reminiscence of <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; possibly also of <a href="/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>.
