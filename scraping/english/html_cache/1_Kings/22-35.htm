The battle took place at Ramoth-gilead, a strategically significant location east of the Jordan River. The prolonged nature of the battle suggests a fierce struggle, reflecting the ongoing hostilities between these two nations. This context highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy given by Micaiah, who warned of disaster for King Ahab if he went to battle.<p><b>and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans.</b><br>King Ahab's decision to remain in his chariot despite his injury demonstrates his determination and perhaps his pride. Being propped up suggests he was severely wounded but still wanted to maintain the appearance of leadership and control. This act can be seen as a reflection of Ahab's character, often depicted as stubborn and defiant against God's warnings. The chariot, a symbol of military power, becomes a place of vulnerability for Ahab, contrasting his earlier confidence.<p><b>And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot,</b><br>The imagery of blood flowing onto the chariot floor is vivid and symbolic. Blood in the Bible often signifies life, death, and sacrifice. Ahab's bloodshed fulfills the prophecy of Elijah, who foretold that dogs would lick Ahab's blood (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). This moment underscores the certainty of God's judgment and the consequences of Ahab's disobedience and idolatry. The chariot, once a tool of war, becomes a vessel of divine retribution.<p><b>and that evening he died.</b><br>Ahab's death marks the end of his reign and the culmination of his defiance against God. The timing of his death, occurring in the evening, may symbolize the end of an era and the darkness that follows a life lived in opposition to God's commands. Ahab's demise serves as a sobering reminder of the inevitable judgment that comes to those who reject God's word. His death also sets the stage for the transition of power and the continued narrative of Israel's kings, emphasizing the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was wounded in battle and eventually died.

Evidently he conceals the deadliness of his hurt, though it disables him from action, and bravely sustains the battle, till his strength fails. Then the news spreads, and the army disperses; but the subsequent history seems to show that no fatal defeat was incurred. This union of desperate physical bravery with moral feebleness and cowardice is common enough in history, and (as Shakespeare has delighted to show in his Macbeth) most true to nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the battle increased</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">went up</span>. Marg. <span class="accented">ascended</span>. The tide of warfare rose higher and higher. Both Keil and Bahr think that the image is taken from a swelling river and cite <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>.

Chariots were destitute of seats. According to Thenius and Keil, he maintained himself erect, by his own strength. But the word is passive] <span class="cmt_word">against the Syrians</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in the face of the Syrians</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> <span class="accented">coram</span>. His back was not turned to them, as he had desired. The idea that he was in any way fighting against the Syrians is altogether foreign to the text. It is at first sight somewhat difficult to reconcile this statement with the direction given to the charioteer in the preceding verse, and some have been led, though without sufficient warrant, to conclude that Ahab left the field, had he wound bound up, and then returned to take his part in the battle. But the explanation is very simple. As the battle increased, it became impossible to comply with the king's desire. So thick was the fight that retreat was impossible. Hence the wounded king, who would otherwise have sunk down to the bottom of the chariot, had to be "stayed up in the presence of the Syrians." This circumstance may also account for the fact that he died at even. Had it been possible to remove him and staunch his wounds, he might have lingered for some time. As it was, he bled to death. It is not clear, therefore, that "his death was kingly" (Kitto), or that we must concede to Ahab "the credit of right princely fortitude on this occasion" (Rawlinson). He would have left the host could he have done so. It was his set-rants propped up the dying man in his chariot, to encourage the army. What a picture for an artist - the king with the pallor of death spreading over his face, the anxious faces of the attendants, the pool of blood, the sun sinking to the horizon, etc.], <span class="cmt_word">and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the blood of the wound poured</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into the midst</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bosom</span>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the hollow part, or "well."
