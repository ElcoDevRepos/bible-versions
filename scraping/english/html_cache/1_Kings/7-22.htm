Lilies are often associated with beauty and purity in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/songs/2.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1-2</a>, where the lily symbolizes love and beauty. The use of lilies in the temple's design may signify the purity and holiness of the place where God's presence dwells. Architecturally, the lily shape could have been both decorative and functional, possibly aiding in the structural integrity of the pillars. The choice of lilies also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's creation, as lilies are mentioned by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>, emphasizing God's provision and care.<p><b>So the work of the pillars was completed.</b><br>This phrase signifies the completion of a significant part of the temple construction, highlighting the meticulous planning and execution involved in building the house of the Lord. The completion of the pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, is not just a physical achievement but also a spiritual milestone, as these pillars stood at the entrance of the temple, symbolizing strength and stability. The completion of the pillars can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate completion of God's redemptive work through Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the cornerstone (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>). The finished work of the pillars parallels the finished work of Christ on the cross, bringing to completion God's plan of salvation. Historically, the completion of the temple under Solomon's reign marked a period of peace and prosperity for Israel, reflecting God's blessing and favor upon the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.

The two pillars would thus resemble two giant plants, the column answering to the stalk, the capital to the flower.
