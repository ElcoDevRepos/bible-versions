The logs from Lebanon refer to the famous cedars, known for their quality and durability, which were highly prized in the ancient world. Lebanon's cedar forests were renowned, and their wood was used for significant construction projects, including temples and palaces. The use of "my servants" indicates the organized labor force under Hiram's command, showcasing the political and economic alliances of the time. This collaboration reflects the peaceful relations between Israel and its neighbors during Solomon's reign, a period marked by prosperity and extensive building projects.<p><b>and I will float them as rafts by sea to the place you specify</b><br>The transportation of logs by sea was a practical solution to the challenges of moving large timber over long distances. The Mediterranean Sea provided a natural route for such transportation. This method of floating logs as rafts was efficient and minimized the risk of damage during transit. The phrase "to the place you specify" indicates Solomon's authority and the careful planning involved in the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. This logistical detail underscores the advanced engineering and organizational skills of the time, as well as the importance of the Temple project.<p><b>There I will separate the logs, and you can take them away</b><br>Once the logs reached their destination, they would be separated and prepared for use in construction. This process required skilled labor and careful handling to ensure the wood's integrity. The phrase "you can take them away" signifies the transfer of materials from Hiram's control to Solomon's, highlighting the trust and cooperation between the two kings. This exchange also reflects the broader theme of mutual benefit and resource sharing, which was essential for the success of large-scale projects in the ancient Near East.<p><b>And in exchange, you can meet my needs by providing my household with food</b><br>This part of the agreement illustrates the barter system common in ancient economies, where goods and services were exchanged without the use of currency. Hiram's request for food supplies for his household indicates the interdependence between the two kingdoms. The provision of food was a significant contribution, as it supported not only Hiram's household but also the workers involved in the logging and transportation process. This exchange highlights the economic and diplomatic relationships that were crucial for maintaining peace and prosperity in the region. The mutual benefit of this arrangement reflects the wisdom and strategic thinking attributed to Solomon, aligning with the biblical portrayal of his reign as a time of unprecedented peace and wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The King of Tyre, who was a friend of David and provided materials for Solomon's temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its cedar trees, which were highly valued for construction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Refers to the Mediterranean Sea, used as a route for transporting the logs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_construction.htm">The Temple Construction</a></b><br>The event of building the temple in Jerusalem, a significant project in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_cooperation.htm">The Importance of Cooperation</a></b><br>The partnership between Solomon and Hiram demonstrates the value of working together for a common goal.

Solomon, in turn, will supply abundant food to Hiram&#8217;s royal household. The verse showcases practical wisdom, honest trade, and cooperative labor, all moving toward the sacred goal of building God&#8217;s temple.

The transport of cedars to the Mediterranean would be an easy undertaking compared with the carriage of them to Nineveh, and we know from the inscriptions that they were imported by the Assyrian kings] <span class="cmt_word">and I will convey them by se</span>a in floats [Heb. "<span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will make</span> (or put) <span class="accented">them rafts in the sea."</span> This was the primitive, as it was the obvious, way, of conveying timber, among Greeks and Romans, as well as among Eastern races. The reader will probably have seen such rafts on the Rhine or other river] <span class="cmt_word">unto the place which</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt appoint</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">send</span>] me [In <a href="/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>, Hiram assumes that this place will be Joppa, now Yafo, the port of Jerusalem, and 40 miles distant from the Holy City. The transport over these 40 miles, also of most rugged and trying road, must have involved, if possible, a still greater toil than that from Lebanon to the sea] <span class="cmt_word">and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">do</span>, same word as in ver. 8, and probably used designedly - "I will perform thy desire.., and thou shalt perform my desire." There shall be a strict <span class="accented">quid pro quo</span>] <span class="cmt_word">my desire, in giving food for my household</span> [Hiram states in his reply in what shape he would prefer the hire promised by Solomon (ver. 6). The food for the royal <span class="accented">household</span> must be carefully distinguished from the food given to the <span class="accented">workmen</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-10.htm">2 Chronicles 2:10</a>). The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the <span class="accented">second</span> temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">rid</span> Joppa, in return for "meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon" (<a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The selection of <span class="accented">food</span> as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper ("the great plain of the city of Sidon," Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1440;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
