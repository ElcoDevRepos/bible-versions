The Arameans were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. The mention of "thirty-two chariot commanders" indicates a well-organized military force, as chariots were a crucial component of ancient Near Eastern warfare. This reflects the historical context of the time, where chariotry was a symbol of military might and technological advancement. The number thirty-two may also suggest a coalition of forces, as seen in previous battles involving Aram.<p><b>&#8220;Do not fight with anyone, small or great,</b><br>This command highlights a strategic focus on a specific target rather than engaging in a general battle. The phrase "small or great" underscores the exclusivity of the command, indicating that the Arameans were to avoid unnecessary conflict with other soldiers or officers. This tactic reflects a calculated approach to warfare, aiming to destabilize Israel by removing its leadership. It also suggests the king of Aram's recognition of the importance of leadership in maintaining the morale and effectiveness of an army.<p><b>except the king of Israel.&#8221;</b><br>The king of Israel at this time was Ahab, known for his idolatry and opposition to the prophets of Yahweh. The focus on Ahab aligns with the biblical theme of divine judgment against leaders who lead their people away from God. This directive can be seen as part of a larger narrative where God uses foreign nations to execute judgment on Israel, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament. The targeting of Ahab also foreshadows his eventual downfall, fulfilling the prophetic words spoken against him by prophets like Elijah. This moment can be viewed as a type of Christ, where the focus on a single leader in battle contrasts with Jesus, who, as the ultimate King, willingly faced His enemies to bring salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_aram.htm">King of Aram</a></b><br>The ruler of Aram (Syria), who is in conflict with Israel.

In ancient warfare, chariots could determine the outcome of a battle (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16-18</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Thirty-two echoes <a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, where the same number of kings supported Ben-hadad. It suggests he retained a structured coalition even after previous defeats, revealing persistent opposition to God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores organized hostility against Israel, illustrating the ongoing spiritual conflict described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not fight with anyone, small or great,</b><p>&#8226; Ben-hadad&#8217;s command narrows engagement rules: ignore rank-and-file targets.<p>&#8226; Such selective warfare is rare and highlights obsession with a single objective&#8212;eliminate Ahab. Similar fixations appear in <a href="/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1-4</a> (Ahithophel&#8217;s counsel to strike only David) and <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a> (Herod&#8217;s lethal focus on the Christ-child).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;small or great&#8221; conveys total exclusion; no one else matters. Scripture frequently uses this pair to stress comprehensiveness (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-18.htm">Revelation 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, it reveals the futility of opposing God&#8217;s decrees. While Aram schemes, God has already spoken death over Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>; 22:17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except the king of Israel.</b><p>&#8226; The entire battle plan centers on Ahab. Ben-hadad likely believes killing the monarch will collapse Israel&#8217;s resistance.<p>&#8226; Ironically, Ahab&#8217;s attempt at disguise (<a href="/1_kings/22-30.htm">1 Kings 22:30</a>) shows he understands the danger yet still defies God&#8217;s prophetic warning delivered by Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-18.htm">1 Kings 22:18-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The targeted hostility parallels Satan&#8217;s attacks on key covenant figures&#8212;Moses (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28-30</a>). Yet God&#8217;s will prevails; Ahab will fall exactly as foretold, not because of military precision but because &#8220;it is appointed&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The single stray arrow that later pierces Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34-38</a>) demonstrates divine sovereignty overruling human calculation (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ben-hadad&#8217;s directive, though tactically shrewd, showcases humanity&#8217;s limited control before the all-knowing, all-sovereign Lord.

[This Orientalism, translated into Western ideas, means, "Direct your weapons against the king." What Ahab had done to provoke such resentment is not quite clear. Rawlinson supposes that Ben-hadad's "defeat and captivity were still rankling in his mind, and he wished to retaliate on Ahab the humiliation which he considered himself to have suffered." But it is impossible to see in Ahab's generous conduct towards him a sufficient reason for the fierce hatred which these words disclose. It is much more probable that some affront had subsequently been offered to the Syrian monarch, possibly in the shape of the reproaches which Ahab may have addressed to him on account of his retention of Ramoth-Gilead, and the gross violation of the treaty of <a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>. It is also possible that he hoped that the death of Ahab would terminate the war (Bahr).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
