Treaties were often established to ensure peace and mutual benefit between neighboring kingdoms. The reference to a previous treaty between the fathers of the current kings suggests a historical precedent for cooperation. This aligns with the biblical theme of generational influence and the importance of maintaining alliances for stability. The fathers mentioned are likely Abijah of Judah and a previous king of Aram, indicating a continuation of diplomatic relations.<p><b>See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold.</b><br>Offering gifts was a customary practice to secure favor and demonstrate sincerity in negotiations. The use of silver and gold highlights the wealth and resources available to the king of Judah, as well as the importance of these metals in ancient economies. This act of sending valuable gifts underscores the seriousness of the request and the desire to influence the recipient's decision. Biblically, gifts often symbolize attempts to sway or appease, as seen in other instances like Jacob sending gifts to Esau.<p><b>Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel,</b><br>This request for the king of Aram to break his treaty with Baasha reflects the complex political landscape of the time, where alliances could shift rapidly. Baasha was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, and his actions were a threat to Judah. The breaking of a treaty was a significant act, often leading to conflict, and it demonstrates the strategic maneuvering employed by the king of Judah to protect his kingdom. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their often-contentious relationship.<p><b>so that he will withdraw from me.</b><br>The ultimate goal of this diplomatic effort is to relieve pressure from Baasha's military actions against Judah. The withdrawal of Baasha's forces would provide security and stability for the kingdom of Judah. This phrase highlights the constant threat of warfare and the need for strategic alliances to ensure a nation's survival. In the biblical context, it also illustrates the reliance on human strategies rather than divine intervention, a recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.

The text presents this event as historical fact, mirroring the same action recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-1.htm">2 Chronicles 16:1-3</a>.<p>&#8226; This &#8220;treaty&#8221; (literally, a covenant) represents a deliberate choice to rely on human power. Earlier, when Zerah the Cushite attacked, Asa had prayed, &#8220;O LORD, there is no one besides You to help&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>). The contrast is stark: once he trusted solely in the LORD, now he turns to an earthly king.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly cautions against alliances that sideline dependence on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). The verse confronts us with the timeless temptation to seek security in human agreements rather than divine faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as there was between my father and your father</b><p>&#8226; Asa appeals to precedent. Abijah (his father) and Tab-rimmon/Hezion (Ben-hadad&#8217;s lineage) had enjoyed peaceful dealings, so Asa assumes another pact is permissible.<p>&#8226; Yet Abijah&#8217;s earlier victory over Israel had been credited to the LORD&#8217;s help, not to foreign aid (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-13.htm">2 Chronicles 13:13-18</a>). Asa&#8217;s invocation of family tradition blurs that vital distinction.<p>&#8226; Family heritage can be a blessing (<a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>) or a stumbling block when it justifies compromise (<a href="/mark/7-9.htm">Mark 7:9-13</a>). Scripture reminds us that past arrangements never override present obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;gift&#8221; comes from treasuries of both the royal house and the temple (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>). Funds once dedicated to worship now bankroll political maneuvering.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-2.htm">2 Chronicles 16:2</a> repeats this detail, underscoring its seriousness. Squandering holy things for human schemes echoes earlier losses under Rehoboam, when Shishak plundered temple gold (<a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The Word warns that wealth can be misused to buy influence (<a href="/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>) and that &#8220;You cannot serve God and money&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>). Here, the misdirected treasure signals a heart drifting from exclusive trust in the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Asa asks Ben-hadad to betray Israel, tempting him with riches. This request calls for faithlessness toward Baasha so Asa can gain the upper hand.<p>&#8226; The prophet Hanani later condemns Asa for relying on Aram: &#8220;Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD&#8230; you have done foolishly&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture portrays covenant-breaking as sin (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>). Inviting another party to do so compounds the offense (<a href="/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>). The text highlights how self-interest can rationalize treachery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that he will withdraw from me</b><p>&#8226; Asa&#8217;s immediate aim is tactical: force Baasha to abandon the fortification of Ramah, which threatened Judah&#8217;s trade and security (<a href="/1_kings/15-17.htm">1 Kings 15:17-22</a>).<p>&#8226; The strategy works&#8212;Ben-hadad attacks Israel&#8217;s northern cities, Baasha retreats, and Asa dismantles Ramah. Yet the short-term success carries hidden costs: continual war (<a href="/1_kings/15-16.htm">1 Kings 15:16</a>) and future disease for Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>) illustrate the fallout of misplaced trust.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a> reminds us, &#8220;A king is not saved by a large army&#8230; a horse is a vain hope for salvation.&#8221; Earthly victories achieved apart from God&#8217;s direction prove hollow in the long run.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Asa&#8217;s message to Ben-hadad reveals a progression: appealing to human alliance, leaning on family precedent, funding compromise with sacred treasure, encouraging betrayal, and seeking relief by any worldly means. Though the plan brings a swift military benefit, Scripture later exposes its spiritual bankruptcy. The verse therefore warns believers to guard their hearts against the subtle drift from trusting the LORD to trusting political leverage, financial resources, or inherited traditions. Real security lies not in treaties or treasure but in steadfast dependence on the faithful God who never breaks covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a league</span> [Rawlinson would render, "Let there be a league... as there was," but the A.V. is equally good.
