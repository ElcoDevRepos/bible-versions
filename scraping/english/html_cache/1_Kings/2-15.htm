His claim to the throne was based on being the eldest surviving son after the deaths of his older brothers Amnon and Absalom. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the eldest son often had a strong claim to succeed his father as king. However, David had chosen Solomon, his son with Bathsheba, to be his successor, as directed by God (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). This phrase reflects Adonijah's belief in his right to the throne, which was a common expectation in the royal succession practices of the time.<p><b>&#8220;All Israel expected that I should reign,&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's statement indicates that he had garnered significant support from key figures and the people of Israel, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7-9</a>, where he secured the backing of Joab, the commander of the army, and Abiathar the priest. This support suggests that many in Israel anticipated his reign, aligning with the cultural norms of primogeniture. However, the political landscape was complex, and the ultimate decision rested with God's will, as seen in the anointing of Solomon.<p><b>&#8220;but the kingship has turned to my brother,&#8221;</b><br>The shift in kingship to Solomon was a result of divine intervention and the fulfillment of God's promise to David. Nathan the prophet and Bathsheba played crucial roles in ensuring Solomon's anointing (<a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-40</a>). This transfer of power highlights the theme of God's sovereignty over human affairs, a recurring theme in the biblical narrative. It also underscores the idea that God's plans may not always align with human expectations or traditions.<p><b>&#8220;for it has come to him from the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>This acknowledgment by Adonijah reflects a recognition of God's ultimate authority in establishing rulers, as seen throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The phrase emphasizes the belief that God actively directs the course of history and the leadership of His people. Solomon's kingship was part of God's covenantal promise to David, ensuring that his lineage would continue to rule Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This divine endorsement of Solomon's reign prefigures the messianic expectation of a future king from David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who initially attempted to claim the throne of Israel.

Like Balaam, he speaks truth while his heart remains unchanged (<a href="/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>; 24:1-4). His subsequent request for Abishag (<a href="/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17</a>) exposes continued ambition, leading to his death (<a href="/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/2-15.htm">1 Kings 2:15</a> captures Adonijah&#8217;s frustrated admission that, though birth order and public expectation seemed to guarantee him the throne, God sovereignly gave kingship to Solomon. The verse contrasts human entitlement with divine election, underscoring that every throne belongs to the LORD and that recognizing His decision requires humble submission, not mere lip service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Thou knowest</span>.--Adonijah's words show craft, flattering Bath-sheba by extolling her influence, and making merit of his surrender to Solomon, in obedience to the Lord's decree, of a kingdom which, in evident contradiction to fact, he asserts to have been destined to him by popular desire. The petition, however, apparently harmless, and (since Abishag was concubine of David only in name) involving nothing unnatural, had perhaps a covert design: for, by universal Eastern custom, to take a king's wives was the known privilege or duty of his successor. Hence the counsel, most unseemly but still probably politic, given by Ahithophel to Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm" title="And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred of your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong.">2Samuel 16:21</a>). If, therefore, Adonijah had publicly espoused Abishag, it might have seemed a virtual renewal of his claim to the crown. This Solomon sees at once, though Bath-sheba, strangely enough, does not see it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine</span> [<span class="accented">schon so gut wie mein</span> (Bahr). Adonijah evidently made much of the right of primogeniture (cf. ver. 22), which was not unrecognized amongst the Jews. There is possibly in these words, too, a hint at the part Bathsheba had taken in defeating his claims] <span class="cmt_word">and that all Israel set their faces</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, eyes] <span class="cmt_word">upon me that I should reign</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">upon</span> me <span class="accented">all Israel set</span>, etc. The "<span class="accented">me"</span> is emphatic by its position. So is the "<span class="accented">mine"</span> just before used. Several commentators remark that Adonijah's words were not strictly true. But we hardly expect to find truth on such an occasion. Adonijah was adroit and diplomatic, and puts the case as it best serves his purpose. In order to propitiate Bathsheba, he exaggerates his loss and disappointment, just as in the next words, in order to put her off her guard, he plays the saint and obtrudes his piety and resignation ]: <span class="cmt_word">howbeit</span> [lit., <span class="accented">and</span>], <span class="cmt_word">the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from the Lord.</span> [This verse shows pretty clearly that Adoni-jah had not renounced his pretensions to the throne. Despite the pitiful failure of his first conspiracy, and notwithstanding Solomon's generous condonation of his treason, he cannot forget that he was, and is, the eldest surviving son, and had been very near the throne. And as to the kingdom being his brother's by Divine appointment, he cannot have been ignorant of that long ago (<a href="/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), yet he conspired all the same. And it is not difficult to read here between the lines, that he has not relinquished his hopes, and does not acquiesce in Solomon's supremacy.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;&#8216;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the kingship</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#601;&#183;l&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
