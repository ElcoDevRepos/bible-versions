Pharaoh's attack on Gezer demonstrates Egypt's power and strategic interests in Canaan. Gezer was a significant city located on the border of the Philistine plain and the hill country of Judah, making it a valuable military and trade location. The capture of Gezer by Pharaoh indicates a shift in control and influence in the region, which would have had implications for Israel's security and trade routes.<p><b>He had set it on fire,</b><br>The act of setting Gezer on fire signifies a complete conquest and destruction of the city, a common practice in ancient warfare to demonstrate dominance and prevent future resistance. This destruction would have been a clear message to surrounding nations of Egypt's might and a warning against rebellion. Archaeological evidence supports the destruction layers in Gezer, aligning with the biblical account of its conquest.<p><b>killed the Canaanites who lived in the city,</b><br>The killing of the Canaanites reflects the common practice of eliminating the existing population to establish control and prevent future uprisings. This action also aligns with the biblical narrative of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan, where the Canaanites were often depicted as adversaries to be removed. The eradication of the Canaanite presence in Gezer would have facilitated the integration of the city into the Egyptian sphere of influence.<p><b>and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon&#8217;s wife.</b><br>The giving of Gezer as a dowry signifies a political alliance between Egypt and Israel through marriage. This alliance would have strengthened Solomon's position and provided mutual benefits, such as security and trade opportunities. The marriage of Pharaoh's daughter to Solomon is a significant event, reflecting the diplomatic relationships of the time. It also fulfills the biblical theme of foreign alliances, which, while beneficial politically, often led to spiritual challenges for Israel, as seen in Solomon's later years. This alliance foreshadows the complexities of Solomon's reign, where political success was often intertwined with spiritual compromise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh,_king_of_egypt.htm">Pharaoh, King of Egypt</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who attacked and captured Gezer.
