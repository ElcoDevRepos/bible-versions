His return from Egypt, where he had fled from Solomon, signifies a pivotal moment in Israel's history. This action reflects the people's desire for change and their recognition of Jeroboam's potential as a leader. The sending for Jeroboam indicates a collective decision by the tribes, highlighting the political unrest and dissatisfaction with Solomon's oppressive policies. This moment fulfills the prophecy given by the prophet Ahijah, who had foretold Jeroboam's rise to power over ten tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>).<p><b>and he and the whole assembly of Israel</b><br>The phrase "the whole assembly of Israel" suggests a united front among the tribes, excluding Judah and Benjamin, who were more aligned with Rehoboam. This assembly represents the northern tribes' collective grievances and their readiness to confront Rehoboam. The unity among the tribes underscores the widespread discontent with the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon's reign, such as forced labor and high taxes. This assembly's actions foreshadow the eventual division of the kingdom, a significant event in Israel's history.<p><b>came to Rehoboam</b><br>Rehoboam, Solomon's son, had ascended to the throne and was in Shechem for his coronation. Shechem, a city with historical significance, was a central location for tribal gatherings and covenant renewals, such as the one led by Joshua (Joshua 24). The choice of Shechem for this meeting underscores its importance as a place of decision-making and covenant. Rehoboam's response to the assembly's demands would determine the future of his reign and the unity of the kingdom.<p><b>and said</b><br>The assembly's approach to Rehoboam was a formal request for relief from the harsh policies of Solomon's administration. Their willingness to negotiate indicates a desire for reconciliation and reform rather than immediate rebellion. This moment is crucial as it tests Rehoboam's wisdom and ability to lead. His response, influenced by the counsel he chooses to follow, ultimately leads to the division of the kingdom, fulfilling the divine judgment pronounced due to Solomon's idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>A former official of Solomon who fled to Egypt to escape Solomon's wrath.

And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came</span> [It has been held that this verse is largely an interpolation. The LXX. Cod. Vat. has simply, "<span class="accented">And the people</span> spake unto king Rehoboam, saying." Of more importance, however, is the fact that it is at direct variance with ver. 20, which places the appearance of Jeroboam on the scene <span class="accented">after</span> the revolt of the tribes. Indeed, these two verses can only be brought into agreement by the questionable device of understanding the "all Israel" of ver. 20 very differently from the same expression in ver. 1. If, however, we follow in this instance the LXX., which omits the name of Jeroboam both here and in ver. 12 (and which thereby implies that he was not one of the deputation to Rehoboam, but, as ver. 2 states, was at that time still in Egypt), the difficulty vanishes. Ver. 20 then becomes the natural and logical continuation of vers. 2, 3. "And Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt. And they sent and called him [to the country.]... And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again [at their summons] they sent and called him unto the congregation," etc. And in favour of the omission of Jeroboam's name is the fact that the Hebrew text, both in ver. 3 and in ver. 12, betrays some little confusion.
