The measurement of ten cubits (approximately 15 feet or 4.5 meters) indicates their grandeur and significance. This size reflects the importance of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies, where they overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant. The use of cubits, an ancient unit of measurement, aligns with the construction practices of the time, as seen in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. The cherubim's size emphasizes the reverence and awe associated with God's dwelling place.<p><b>both cherubim had the same size and shape,</b><br>The uniformity in size and shape of the cherubim highlights the order and precision in the construction of the Temple, reflecting God's nature of harmony and perfection. This symmetry can be seen as a representation of divine order, mirroring the balance and unity found in creation. The cherubim's identical appearance also signifies equality and consistency in the divine realm, reinforcing the idea that God's presence is unchanging and steadfast. This concept of uniformity is echoed in other biblical passages, such as the detailed instructions for the Tabernacle in Exodus, where specific measurements and designs were given to ensure everything was made according to God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem.

The phrase highlights the exact size of the second figure: &#8220;ten cubits,&#8221; or roughly fifteen feet (<a href="/1_kings/6-25.htm">1 Kings 6:25</a>).<p>&#8211; Scripture repeatedly notes dimensions because God cares about details. In <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a> the LORD told Moses, &#8220;See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain&#8221;. Solomon, centuries later, follows that same principle of precise obedience.<p>&#8211; Similar measurements appear in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-10.htm">2 Chronicles 3:10&#8211;13</a>, reinforcing that these towering beings dominated the Holy of Holies visually, their wings spreading wall to wall.<p>&#8211; By matching the height of the sanctuary&#8217;s ceiling (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>), the cherubim draw every gaze upward, reminding worshipers that the LORD is enthroned above (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The size also echoes the first biblical mention of cherubim in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, where God stationed them to guard Eden. Their imposing stature in the temple signals that holy things remain protected, inviting reverent awe rather than casual approach (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Both cherubim had the same size and shape</b><p>&#8211; Uniformity matters. Nothing in God&#8217;s house is haphazard; &#8220;God is not a God of disorder, but of peace&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>).<p>&#8211; Identical design shows deliberate symmetry, reflecting the heavenly order Moses glimpsed (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18&#8211;20</a>). <a href="/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> reminds us the earthly sanctuary &#8220;serves as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things.&#8221; When we see equal cherubim, we see consistency with the unchanging character of God (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8211; The matching figures also picture unity. Just as &#8220;there is one body and one Spirit&#8221; among God&#8217;s people (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>), the paired cherubim together form a single testimony: the LORD rules in perfect harmony.<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: when believers serve side by side with a common purpose and Christlike likeness, the church reflects that same symmetry and order (<a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>). God&#8217;s glory is showcased when His servants are in sync.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/6-25.htm">1 Kings 6:25</a> underscores God&#8217;s meticulous design: two towering, identical cherubim stand guard in Solomon&#8217;s Most Holy Place. Their equal ten-cubit height points to God&#8217;s majesty and His call for precise obedience. Their matching size and shape reveal heavenly order and unified testimony. Just as the cherubim harmoniously display God&#8217;s glory, so His people are invited to serve together in reverent, ordered unity under the sovereign King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the other cherub was ten cubits;
