This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through his actions and decisions. In the Hebrew context, love for God is often expressed through obedience and devotion. Solomon's love reflects the covenant relationship established between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. This love sets the stage for Solomon's request for wisdom and his initial faithfulness in leading Israel.<p><b>and walked in the statutes of his father David</b><br>Walking in the statutes of David implies that Solomon followed the godly example set by his father. David, despite his flaws, was a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The statutes refer to the laws and decrees given by God, which David upheld. Solomon's adherence to these statutes indicates his commitment to maintaining the spiritual and moral standards established by David. This continuity is crucial for the stability and prosperity of the kingdom, as it aligns with the promises made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<p><b>except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places</b><br>The high places were sites of worship located on elevated ground, often associated with Canaanite religious practices. While these places were initially used for worshiping Yahweh, they later became centers for idolatry. Solomon's use of high places reveals a compromise in his devotion. Although he loved the LORD, his actions here show a deviation from the centralized worship that God desired, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-5</a>. This practice foreshadows Solomon's later spiritual decline, as he eventually builds high places for foreign gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7-8</a>), leading to the division of the kingdom. Solomon's actions serve as a warning about the dangers of syncretism and the importance of pure worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building the First Temple in Jerusalem.
