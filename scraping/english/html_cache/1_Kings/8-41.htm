In the ancient Near East, foreigners were often seen as outsiders, yet here they are acknowledged in the context of worship. This inclusion foreshadows the New Testament teaching that the Gospel is for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>who is not of Your people Israel</b><br>This emphasizes the distinction between the Israelites, God's chosen people, and those who are not part of this covenant community. It highlights the unique relationship Israel had with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, but also points to the broader plan of God to bless all nations through Israel (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>but has come from a distant land</b><br>The mention of a distant land suggests a journey motivated by a significant purpose. This reflects the idea that God's fame and deeds were known beyond Israel's borders, as seen in the accounts of the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-13</a>) and the Ethiopian eunuch (<a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27-39</a>). It underscores the universal appeal of God's name and the draw it has for those seeking truth.<p><b>because of Your name&#8212;</b><br>The "name" of God represents His character, reputation, and deeds. In the ancient world, a name was more than a label; it conveyed the essence of a person or deity. The foreigner's journey is motivated by the recognition of God's greatness, as seen in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/86-9.htm">Psalm 86:9</a>) and the prophetic vision of all nations worshiping God (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).

The verse foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s global reach: whoever hungers for the one true God, no matter how far away, will be welcomed when they call on His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41-43) <span class= "bld">Moreover, concerning a stranger.</span>--These verses in a striking digression (perhaps suggested by the general acknowledgment in the previous verse of God's knowledge of every human heart), interpose in the series of references to Israel a prayer for the acceptance of the prayer of the "stranger" who should come from afar to confess the Lord Jehovah, and to "pray toward this house." Such recognition of the stranger, not as an enemy or even a complete alien, but as in some sense capable of communion with the true God, was especially natural in Solomon; first, because in his days many strangers came from afar, drawn by the fame of his wisdom and magnificence, so that the old exclusiveness of the Israelites must have been greatly broken down; and next, because the character of the thought and writing of his age, searching (as in the books of Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes) into the great religious problems which belong to man as man, naturally led to that wider view of the kingdom of God over all nations, which is worked out so strikingly in the writings of the prophets. That the case contemplated is probably not imaginary, is shown by the examples of King Hiram and the Queen of Sheba. Admiration of the glory of Israel would lead inevitably to some belief in, and "fear" of, the God of Israel; and it might well go on to the further result, here contemplated, of a fuller acknowledgment of the Lord Jehovah, and of the sacredness of the worship of His appointed Temple, which would tell silently on all the religions of the East. It was expressly provided for in the Law (<a href="/context/numbers/15-14.htm" title="And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.">Numbers 15:14-16</a>): and in spite of the greater exclusiveness of the ages after the Captivity, heathen princes were often allowed to offer in the Temple. This recognition of the stranger from afar is different from the frequent recognition of the resident "stranger within their gates," as being under the protection of God, and to be "loved" by those who had been "strangers in the land of Egypt" (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/10-18.htm" title="He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>). But, like it, it nobly distinguished the Law of Israel from most ancient codes; it stood out as a striking, though often unheeded, protest against the hard exclusiveness of the Jewish temper; it was a tacit anticipation of the future gathering in of all nations to enjoy the blessing which was from the beginning expressly destined for "all families of the earth."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;</span> [Solomon takes it for granted that such will come, and not without good reason, for the house was "exceeding magnifical" and destined to be "of fame and glory throughout all countries" (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>). And we can hardly doubt that in the visit of the Queen of Sheba we are to see one fulfilment of this anticipation. (Note the expression of ch. 10:1 "concerning the <span class="accented">name of the Lord</span>.") One who blessed God, as she did (ver. 9), would certainly pray towards the house. In the time of the <span class="accented">second</span> temple there were several instances of strangers (<span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Philadelphus, and Seleucus;
