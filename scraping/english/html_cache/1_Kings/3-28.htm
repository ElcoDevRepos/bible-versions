The story is a demonstration of Solomon's God-given wisdom, which he requested from God in a dream (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-12</a>). The phrase "all Israel" indicates the widespread impact and reach of Solomon's decision, suggesting that news of his wisdom traveled quickly throughout the nation. This reflects the centralized nature of Solomon's reign and the unity of Israel under his leadership. The judgment itself is a testament to the king's ability to discern truth and administer justice, a key responsibility of a ruler in ancient Israel.<p><b>they stood in awe of him</b><br>The reaction of the people, standing in awe, highlights the respect and reverence they had for Solomon as their king. This awe is not merely fear but a recognition of divine wisdom at work through Solomon. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, a king's ability to render wise judgments was seen as a sign of divine favor and legitimacy. This awe also underscores the importance of justice in maintaining social order and the king's role as God's representative on earth.<p><b>for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Solomon's wisdom was not of human origin but was a divine gift. The wisdom of God in Solomon is a fulfillment of God's promise to grant him a wise and discerning heart (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). This divine wisdom is a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). Solomon's wisdom foreshadows the perfect wisdom of Jesus, who would come to administer true justice and righteousness.<p><b>to administer justice</b><br>Administering justice was a central duty of the king in Israel, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, where the king is instructed to read and follow the law to ensure justice. Solomon's ability to administer justice effectively is a reflection of his adherence to God's law and his role as a shepherd of God's people. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of justice, which is a key attribute of God's character (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>). Solomon's reign, marked by peace and prosperity, is a partial fulfillment of the messianic hope for a ruler who would bring justice and righteousness, ultimately realized in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.
