Here, from the careful description of the outstretched wings, of ten cubits in width for each cherub, meeting in the midst of the house and touching the walls, it would seem that they must have been turned so as to face the entrance. The cherubim over the ark are described only in three places in the Old Testament--in the passages in Exodus, here, and in the parallel <a href="/context/2_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.">2Chronicles 3:10-13</a>, and in those great visions of the priestly prophet Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-25</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/10-1.htm" title="Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>) which have determined the imagery of the Apocalypse.

Josephus, indeed, in his description of the Temple (Antt. viii. c. 3, ? 3), expressly says that "no one can tell, or even conjecture, of what shape the cherubim were." The tradition, therefore, must have been lost in the Second Temple, where there was no ark; and this is the more strange, because in <a href="/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a> the cherubim are said to have been represented in the embroidery of the curtains, and here (in <a href="/1_kings/6-32.htm" title="The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.">1Kings 6:32</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>) to have been similarly carved on the walls. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And within the oracle</span> [The description now passes on to the mysterious symbolic figures which were placed in the holy of holies] <span class="cmt_word">he made two cherubims</span> [As to the nature, composition, and significance of the cherubim, see notes on Exodus 25:19; 37:7.
