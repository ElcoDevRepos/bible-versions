Elijah, a prophet during the reign of King Ahab, was known for his fervent prayers and deep faith. The fact that the LORD listened to Elijah underscores the importance of righteous living and faithfulness in prayer. This moment is a testament to the intimate relationship between God and His chosen servants, as seen in other instances such as Moses interceding for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Daniel's prayers (<a href="/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20-23</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle that "the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective" (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>and the child&#8217;s life returned to him</b><br>This miraculous event demonstrates God's power over life and death, affirming His sovereignty. The child, the son of the widow of Zarephath, had died, and Elijah's prayer resulted in his resurrection. This act prefigures the resurrection power seen in the New Testament, particularly in the ministry of Jesus Christ, who raised several individuals from the dead, such as Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>) and the widow's son at Nain (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate resurrection of Jesus Himself, which is central to Christian faith.<p><b>and he lived</b><br>The restoration of the child's life not only brought joy to the widow but also served as a powerful testimony to the presence and power of God in a predominantly pagan region. This miracle affirmed Elijah's role as a true prophet of God and strengthened the faith of the widow, who declared, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth" (<a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>). This event is a reminder of God's compassion and His willingness to intervene in human affairs, providing hope and life where there was once despair and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his faith and miracles.
