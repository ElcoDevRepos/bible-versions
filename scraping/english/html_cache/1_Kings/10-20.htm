Lions are symbols of strength, majesty, and royalty, reflecting the power and authority of King Solomon's reign. The presence of lions on the steps leading to the throne signifies the king's dominion and the divine protection over his rule. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>, symbolizing His ultimate authority and kingship.<p><b>one at either end of each step</b><br>The placement of the lions at either end of each step emphasizes balance and symmetry, which are important aspects of ancient Near Eastern architecture and art. This design choice highlights the grandeur and meticulous planning involved in Solomon's palace, reflecting the wisdom and orderliness attributed to Solomon himself. The strategic positioning of the lions may also serve as a reminder of the protection and vigilance required in leadership, as lions are often seen as guardians.<p><b>Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom</b><br>This statement underscores the unparalleled wealth, wisdom, and creativity of Solomon's reign. The grandeur of Solomon's throne and its unique design set his kingdom apart from others, showcasing the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon the wisest and richest king (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>). This phrase also highlights the historical and cultural significance of Solomon's achievements, as his reign became a benchmark for prosperity and divine favor.

Most commentators assume that there were fourteen, and the text will certainly bear that construction. But it is altogether more likely that there were twelve; that is to say, that the two lions on the topmost step are the two mentioned in the preceding verse as "standing beside the stays," otherwise there would have been four lions on that step. And we all know that <span class="accented">twelve</span> had a significance such as could not attach to any other number (Bahr, Symbolik, 1:201-205; 2:133, 423). It would signify that all the tribes had an interest in the royal house (cf. <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>); and a right of approach to the throne (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The lion, a familiar emblem of sovereignty among many nations, had an especial appropriateness in this case, as being the symbol of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; cf. <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>). We are to see in them partly "symbols of the ruler's authority" (Keil), and partly, perhaps, they represented the twelve tribes as guardians of the throne. "The king mounted between figures of lions to his seat on the throne, and sat between figures of lions upon it" (Wordsworth). Thrones somewhat similar to this in character, but much less magnificent, are represented on the Assyrian monuments.
