Adonijah had previously attempted to claim the throne before Solomon was anointed king. His approach to Bathsheba indicates a strategic move, as she holds influence with King Solomon. The request signifies a moment of political maneuvering, reflecting the complex dynamics of royal succession in ancient Israel. The phrase also highlights the importance of intercessors in biblical narratives, as Bathsheba is seen as a mediator between Adonijah and Solomon.<p><b>do not deny me.&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's plea not to be denied suggests a sense of urgency and desperation. In the cultural context of the time, making a request through a respected intermediary was a common practice, especially when the petitioner was in a vulnerable position. This phrase underscores the tension and potential consequences of Adonijah's previous actions against Solomon's kingship. It also reflects the biblical theme of seeking favor and mercy, which is echoed in other scriptures where individuals appeal to those in authority for their needs or desires.<p><b>&#8220;State your request,&#8221;</b><br>Bathsheba's response is one of openness and willingness to listen, which is significant given her position as the queen mother. Her role is crucial, as she has the ear of King Solomon and can influence his decisions. This interaction demonstrates the respect and authority she holds within the royal court. The phrase also illustrates the biblical principle of seeking wisdom and understanding before making decisions, as seen in Solomon's own request for wisdom from God earlier in 1 Kings.<p><b>she told him.</b><br>The narrative here emphasizes Bathsheba's active participation in the unfolding events. Her involvement in this dialogue is pivotal, as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions of King Solomon. Bathsheba's role as a mother and advisor is a recurring theme in the Bible, where women often play key roles in God's plans, such as Esther and Deborah. This phrase also highlights the importance of communication and the power of words in shaping outcomes, a theme prevalent throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who previously attempted to claim the throne of Israel, despite Solomon being the chosen successor.
