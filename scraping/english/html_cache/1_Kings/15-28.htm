His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, aligning with the covenantal faithfulness expected of the Davidic line. Asa's reign began around 911 BC, and his commitment to God is highlighted in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>, where he is described as doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord. This period marks a time of relative stability and religious renewal in Judah, contrasting with the turmoil in the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>Baasha killed Nadab</b><br>Nadab was the son of Jeroboam, the first king of the divided northern kingdom of Israel. His reign was short, lasting only two years, and was marked by continued idolatry, following in the sinful ways of his father (<a href="/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25-26</a>). Baasha, from the tribe of Issachar, assassinated Nadab during a military campaign against the Philistine city of Gibbethon. This act of violence reflects the instability and frequent power struggles in the northern kingdom, where dynastic changes often occurred through assassination and conspiracy.<p><b>and reigned in his place</b><br>Baasha's rise to power marks the beginning of a new dynasty in Israel, as he established himself as king after killing Nadab. His reign lasted 24 years, from approximately 909 to 886 BC. Baasha's rule is characterized by continued conflict with Judah and persistent idolatry, as he walked in the ways of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>). His actions fulfilled the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah, who foretold the destruction of Jeroboam's house due to their sins (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>).
