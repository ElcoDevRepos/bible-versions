The concept of being "chosen" is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would be a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). This covenantal relationship is central to Israel's identity and mission. Solomon's use of "Your servant" reflects humility and recognition of his dependence on God, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Jesus emphasizes servanthood (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The idea of being among the people also suggests a sense of solidarity and responsibility, reminiscent of Moses' leadership and intercession for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>).<p><b>a people too numerous to count or number</b><br>This phrase recalls the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). It signifies the growth and prosperity of Israel under God's blessing. The hyperbolic language underscores the vastness of the nation, which had expanded significantly during the reigns of David and Solomon. This growth is both a blessing and a challenge, as it requires wise governance and justice, themes Solomon addresses in his request for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). The phrase also connects to the eschatological vision in Revelation, where a great multitude from every nation stands before the throne of God, too numerous to count (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>), symbolizing the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.
