In the context of <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>, it marks the conclusion of the battle at Ramoth-gilead where King Ahab of Israel was mortally wounded. The setting sun often symbolizes the end of an era or the closing of a chapter, both literally and metaphorically. Biblically, the setting sun can also signify the end of a period of judgment or the completion of God's will, as seen in other passages like <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>, where the sun stood still until Israel achieved victory.<p><b>the cry rang out in the army</b><br>This cry was a proclamation or command that spread throughout the troops. In ancient warfare, such cries were used to communicate orders or signal retreats. The cry here signifies a turning point, as the battle was lost with the death of Ahab. Historically, armies relied on vocal commands and trumpet signals to coordinate movements, especially in the chaos of battle. This cry would have been a clear indication to the soldiers that the campaign was over and they should return home.<p><b>&#8220;Every man to his own city,</b><br>This part of the cry instructed the soldiers to return to their respective cities. In the tribal confederation of Israel, soldiers were often drawn from various cities and regions. The call to return to one's city reflects the decentralized nature of Israel's military structure, where men were not professional soldiers but rather citizens called to arms. This phrase also echoes the dispersal of people after significant events, similar to the scattering of the disciples after Jesus' arrest (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<p><b>and every man to his own land!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of the command emphasizes the urgency and finality of the retreat. It underscores the personal responsibility of each soldier to return to his own land, highlighting the individual nature of the call. This phrase can be seen as a return to normalcy after the chaos of battle, akin to the Israelites returning to their inheritance after periods of conquest or exile. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of returning to one's inheritance or God-given place, as seen in the Jubilee laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel who went into battle against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead and was fatally wounded.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The King of Judah who allied with Ahab in the battle against Aram.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramoth-gilead.htm">Ramoth-gilead</a></b><br>The location of the battle where Ahab was killed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arameans.htm">The Arameans</a></b><br>The opposing army in the battle against Israel and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_army_of_israel.htm">The Army of Israel</a></b><br>The forces that were commanded to retreat after Ahab's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_god's_word.htm">The Inevitability of God's Word</a></b><br>God's prophecies, as spoken through His prophets, will always come to pass.

<a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Sunset also closes the window of opportunity for repentance that Ahab repeatedly ignored (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25&#8211;29</a>).<p>&#8226;

One urgent shout ripples through thousands of soldiers, eclipsing the chaos of combat (<a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God had promised He would &#8220;put the words&#8221; in Micaiah&#8217;s mouth (<a href="/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14&#8211;23</a>); now the army speaks unwittingly in harmony with that divine word.<p>&#8226; The sudden order mirrors other moments when a single command shifts the course of history, such as the panic in the Aramean camp (<a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>) or the trumpet call ending Joab&#8217;s pursuit (<a href="/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every Man to His Own City</b><p>&#8226;
