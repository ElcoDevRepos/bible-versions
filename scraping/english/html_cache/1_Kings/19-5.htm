The broom tree, a desert shrub, provides minimal shade and is often found in arid regions, symbolizing Elijah's desolate state. This moment reflects the human need for rest and the physical limitations even of God's prophets. Elijah's sleep signifies a temporary escape from his overwhelming circumstances, highlighting the importance of rest in times of spiritual and emotional turmoil. This scene parallels Jesus' moments of solitude and rest, such as when He withdrew to pray and rejuvenate (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p><b>Suddenly an angel touched him and said,</b><br>The sudden appearance of the angel signifies divine intervention at a critical moment. Angels in the Bible often serve as messengers and ministers of God's will, providing guidance, protection, and sustenance. The touch of the angel is a gentle yet powerful reminder of God's presence and care, even when Elijah feels abandoned. This encounter is reminiscent of other biblical instances where angels minister to God's servants, such as when an angel strengthens Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Get up and eat.&#8221;</b><br>The angel's command to "get up and eat" addresses Elijah's immediate physical needs, emphasizing the holistic care God provides for His people. This directive underscores the importance of physical nourishment as a precursor to spiritual and emotional recovery. The provision of food in the wilderness recalls God's sustenance of the Israelites with manna during their desert wanderings (Exodus 16), and foreshadows the miraculous feeding of the multitudes by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).

Exhausted physically and emotionally, he seeks shelter beneath a broom tree&#8212;an ordinary desert shrub, yet sufficient shade for God&#8217;s weary servant.<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God meeting people in unremarkable places: Moses at a burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>), Hagar by a spring (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-14</a>). The location may be humble, but God&#8217;s presence there is unmistakable.<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s retreat echoes <a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>, &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty,&#8221; reminding us that true refuge is found in God, not geography.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fell asleep</b><p>&#8226; Sleep is the Creator&#8217;s built-in remedy for spent bodies and frayed emotions. <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a> notes, &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s collapse shows that even God&#8217;s boldest servants reach limits. Compare <a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5-8</a>, where another prophet, drained and discouraged, also seeks shade in the wilderness.<p>&#8226; God does not rebuke Elijah for resting; He allows the needed pause before addressing the deeper spiritual issue.

Here, and in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm" title="And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.">2Kings 6:17</a>, the angel is but auxiliary to the prophet, simply ministering to him in time of danger and distress, as the angel of the Agony to the Prophet of prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as he lay and slept</span> ["While death was called for, the cousin of death comes unbidden" (Hall)] <span class="cmt_word">under a</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one</span>] <span class="cmt_word">Juniper tree, behold, then</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">this</span>; "behold here," <span class="accented">siehe da</span>, Gesen.], <span class="cmt_word">an angel</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">messenger</span>; the same word as in ver. 2, but explained in ver. 7 to be a messenger of <span class="accented">God</span>.
