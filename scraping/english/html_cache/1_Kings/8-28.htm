The term "regard" implies a request for God to consider or give attention to his prayer. This reflects the biblical principle that God is attentive to the prayers of His people (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). The use of "servant" indicates Solomon's acknowledgment of his position before God, emphasizing humility and submission. This is consistent with the biblical theme of servanthood, as seen in figures like Moses and David, who also approached God with humility.<p><b>O LORD my God</b><br>Here, Solomon uses the covenant name of God, "LORD" (YHWH), which signifies a personal and relational God who has made promises to His people. The phrase "my God" indicates a personal relationship and commitment, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This personal address is significant in the context of the dedication of the temple, a place where God's presence would dwell among His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>).<p><b>so that You may hear the cry and the prayer</b><br>Solomon is asking God to be attentive to both the "cry" and the "prayer," suggesting a deep, heartfelt plea. The word "cry" often denotes a sense of urgency or desperation, as seen in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). This dual request highlights the depth of human need and the belief that God is a responsive deity who listens to His people. It also reflects the broader biblical narrative where God hears the cries of His people, such as the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p><b>that Your servant is praying before You today</b><br>The phrase "before You today" emphasizes the immediacy and presence of the prayer. Solomon is standing in the newly built temple, a significant moment in Israel's history, marking the fulfillment of God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The temple serves as a physical representation of God's dwelling place on earth, and Solomon's prayer signifies the beginning of a new era in Israel's worship. This moment foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with His people through Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer during its dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom Solomon is directing his prayer and plea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The newly constructed house of worship where Solomon is dedicating his prayer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation of God's chosen people, for whom Solomon is interceding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dedication_of_the_temple.htm">The Dedication of the Temple</a></b><br>A significant event where Solomon prays for God's presence and blessing upon the temple and the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_humble_petition.htm">The Importance of Humble Petition</a></b><br>Solomon's prayer demonstrates the necessity of approaching God with humility and reverence.
