In this context, Pharaoh's question indicates a relationship of favor and hospitality towards Hadad, an Edomite prince. This reflects the historical alliances and tensions between Egypt and neighboring nations. Pharaoh's inquiry suggests a level of concern or curiosity about Hadad's motives, highlighting the political dynamics of the time.<p><b>&#8220;What have you lacked here with me</b><br>Pharaoh's question implies that Hadad has been well-treated and lacks nothing in Egypt. This reflects the custom of ancient Near Eastern hospitality, where a host was expected to provide for the needs of their guest. It also suggests that Hadad had a privileged status in Pharaoh's court, possibly due to political alliances or personal favor. The question underscores the expectation of loyalty and gratitude from those who receive such hospitality.<p><b>that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?&#8221;</b><br>The sudden desire to return to his homeland indicates a strong sense of national identity and personal mission for Hadad. This reflects the broader biblical theme of longing for one's homeland, as seen in the Israelites' desire to return to the Promised Land. The phrase also suggests a potential political or personal motivation for Hadad's return, possibly to reclaim his position or influence in Edom. This mirrors the biblical narrative of exile and return, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Hadad replied,</b><br>Hadad's response of "Nothing" indicates that his decision to leave is not due to any lack or mistreatment in Egypt. This highlights his contentment with Pharaoh's provision but also suggests a deeper calling or purpose driving his decision. The simplicity of his reply may reflect a diplomatic or respectful tone, acknowledging Pharaoh's generosity while asserting his own intentions.<p><b>&#8220;but please let me go.&#8221;</b><br>Hadad's polite request to leave demonstrates respect for Pharaoh's authority and the formalities of court protocol. This reflects the cultural norms of seeking permission from a ruler before departing, emphasizing the hierarchical structures of ancient societies. The request also indicates Hadad's determination to pursue his own path, possibly foreshadowing future events in the biblical narrative where individuals are called to leave their current circumstances to fulfill a greater purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt during the time of King Solomon.

Motives matter: Hadad&#8217;s return carries the seed of vengeance, paralleling Absalom&#8217;s hidden intentions when he asked David to go to Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221;

Human permission (&#8220;let me go&#8221;) operates within divine sovereignty: &#8220;In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; cf. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Pharaoh&#8217;s caring question, Hadad&#8217;s honest yet restless answer, and God&#8217;s unseen hand combine to show that generous provision cannot redirect a heart God has stirred for His larger purposes. Even hospitable Egypt could not quench Hadad&#8217;s urge to return, an urge God would turn into a tool of judgment against Solomon&#8217;s disobedience. The verse reminds us that God orchestrates kings and refugees alike, exposing motives and fulfilling His word with precise fidelity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?</span> [The natural inquiry of Eastern courtesy.] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">thou shalt surely send me away</span>. Rawlinson says, "There is a remarkable abruptness in this termination." But we must remember how unfinished, to our eyes, Scripture narratives constantly seem. There is no need, consequently, to suspect any accidental omission from the Hebrew text. The LXX., it is true, adds, "and Ader departed," etc., but this may be inferred from vers. 14, 25. And Hadad's persistent desire to depart, for which he assigns no reason, is suggestive of the thoughts which were stirring in his soul. "The keen remembrance of his native land, his lost kingdom, and the slaughter of all his house, gathered strength within him; and all the ease and princely honour which he enjoyed in Egypt availed not against the claims of ambition, vengeance, and patriotism" (Kitto).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/11-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
