The male shrine prostitutes, or "sodomites," were associated with Canaanite religious practices, which included ritualistic sexual acts as part of their worship. These practices were abominations according to the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17-18</a>). Asa's actions demonstrate his commitment to purifying the worship of Yahweh in Judah, aligning with the covenantal laws given to Israel. This reform was significant in the context of the divided kingdom, where idolatry and syncretism were rampant. Asa's actions can be seen as a return to the faithfulness of David, his ancestor, and a rejection of the practices that had led Israel astray.<p><b>and removed all the idols that his fathers had made</b><br>This part of the verse highlights Asa's efforts to eradicate idolatry from Judah. The "idols" refer to the various images and altars dedicated to foreign gods, which had been introduced by previous kings, including Solomon, who allowed his foreign wives to bring their gods into Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>). Asa's removal of these idols signifies a break from the sinful practices of his predecessors and a restoration of monotheistic worship. This act of cleansing the land from idolatry is reminiscent of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and reflects a desire to restore the nation to its covenant relationship with God. Asa's reforms are a precursor to the more extensive reforms of later kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who also sought to purify the worship practices in Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for 41 years.
