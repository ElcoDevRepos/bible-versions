The widow of Zarephath, who was preparing to make her last meal for herself and her son, experienced God's supernatural intervention. This miracle is reminiscent of God's provision of manna for the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-18</a>). It underscores God's ability to sustain His people even in the most desperate circumstances. The jar of flour symbolizes God's unending supply and faithfulness, a theme echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, where Paul assures that God will meet all needs according to His riches in glory.<p><b>and the jug of oil did not run dry</b><br>Oil in the ancient Near East was a staple for cooking, lighting, and anointing, making it a valuable resource. The continuous supply of oil signifies God's abundant grace and provision. This miracle prefigures the New Testament account of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), demonstrating that God provides both physical and spiritual sustenance. The oil also has symbolic significance, often representing the Holy Spirit in Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), indicating the presence and empowerment of God in the lives of His people.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and reliability of God's word. The fulfillment of God's promise through Elijah serves as a testament to His faithfulness and the power of prophetic words. It reflects the biblical principle that God's word does not return void but accomplishes what He desires (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This assurance is foundational for believers, encouraging trust in God's promises and His sovereign plan.<p><b>through Elijah</b><br>Elijah, whose name means "My God is Yahweh," is a central prophetic figure in the Old Testament. His ministry was marked by powerful demonstrations of God's power and authority, challenging the idolatry of Israel under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. Elijah's role as a prophet is significant, as he serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the coming Messiah who would also perform miracles and proclaim God's truth. Elijah's presence at the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-3</a>) further connects his ministry to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who plays a central role in this account.

This is not poetic exaggeration; it records a historical miracle in Zarephath, showing the Lord&#8217;s willingness to meet daily, tangible needs (<a href="/exodus/16-18.htm">Exodus 16:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle began the moment the widow obeyed Elijah&#8217;s request (<a href="/1_kings/17-13.htm">1 Kings 17:13-15</a>). Obedience unlocked provision, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, where God taught Israel dependence by giving manna day by day.<p>&#8226; The unending flour underscores God&#8217;s pledge to sustain His people in famine or plenty, much like <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a> promises, &#8220;And my God will supply all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the jug of oil did not run dry</b><p>&#8226; Oil in Scripture often speaks of refreshment and consecration (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>). Here it is literal cooking oil, yet its constancy hints at God&#8217;s broader care for both body and spirit.<p>&#8226; This scene foreshadows another widow&#8217;s miracle in <a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2-6</a>, where vessels filled until &#8220;no jar was left.&#8221; The repeating pattern reassures believers that what God has done, He can do again.<p>&#8226; The pairing of flour and oil means every ingredient required for daily bread was on hand. The Lord leaves nothing half-finished (<a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken</b><p>&#8226; The hinge of the verse is the reliability of God&#8217;s own word. <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> affirms He does not lie or change His mind; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> declares His word &#8220;will not return to Me empty.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Notice that circumstances&#8212;drought, poverty, desperation&#8212;did not set the agenda; the spoken promise did. <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a> reminds us, &#8220;Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in heaven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every scoop of flour and every drop of oil was a fresh confirmation that divine promises are as sure today as when first uttered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through Elijah</b><p>&#8226; God chose to channel His promise via a prophet. This highlights both the authority of genuine prophetic ministry and the necessity of heeding it (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s presence tested the widow&#8217;s faith; believing the messenger meant trusting the Sender. <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17-18</a> later points to Elijah as an example of a righteous man whose prayers &#8220;stopped the heavens&#8221; and then &#8220;gave rain,&#8221; underscoring the power of a life aligned with God&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; The miracle also served Elijah: the same provision that sustained the widow and her son kept the prophet alive until his next assignment (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>). God&#8217;s care is mutual and communal among His servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/17-16.htm">1 Kings 17:16</a> records a literal, ongoing miracle where flour and oil never failed, vividly demonstrating the Lord&#8217;s faithful provision. The supply endured because God had spoken, and His word, delivered through Elijah, overruled scarcity. The episode teaches that when we trust and obey, God meets every need&#8212;material and spiritual&#8212;exactly as He promises, unfailingly and on time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - And [Omit.
