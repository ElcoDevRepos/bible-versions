His arrival signifies a divine intervention, as Elijah frequently confronted Ahab with messages from God. Elijah's presence is a reminder of God's active role in the affairs of Israel, often sending prophets to guide, warn, and correct His people. Elijah's previous encounters with Ahab, such as the confrontation on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), set the stage for this tense meeting.<p><b>Ahab said to him, &#8220;So you have found me out, my enemy.&#8221;</b><br>Ahab's greeting to Elijah as "my enemy" reflects the king's perception of the prophet as a threat to his rule and personal desires. This animosity stems from Elijah's role in opposing Ahab's idolatry and injustices, particularly his promotion of Baal worship, influenced by his wife Jezebel. Ahab's acknowledgment of being "found out" suggests a guilty conscience and awareness of his wrongdoing, particularly in the context of the recent incident involving Naboth's vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21:1-16</a>).<p><b>He replied, &#8220;I have found you out because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's response highlights Ahab's moral and spiritual corruption. The phrase "sold yourself" implies a deliberate choice to abandon God's commandments for personal gain, akin to a transaction where Ahab exchanged his integrity for power and wealth. This echoes the broader biblical theme of sin as a form of slavery (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>). The "evil in the sight of the LORD" underscores the divine perspective on Ahab's actions, emphasizing that God's standards are the ultimate measure of right and wrong. This confrontation serves as a warning of impending judgment, aligning with the prophetic tradition of calling leaders to account for their actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wickedness and idolatry, particularly influenced by his wife Jezebel.

Elijah&#8217;s arrival at that very scene fulfills God&#8217;s immediate response to injustice, echoing passages like <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a> where judgment is promised on those who &#8220;join house to house.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The literal coming of God&#8217;s prophet at the exact place of sin demonstrates <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>&#8212;no one can hide from the Lord&#8217;s scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ahab said to him, &#8220;So you have found me out, my enemy.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s first words reveal an uneasy conscience. He labels Elijah &#8220;my enemy,&#8221; showing that those who persist in sin regard God&#8217;s messenger as hostile (<a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>; <a href="/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His phrase &#8220;you have found me out&#8221; confesses that he knows he has been doing wrong, resembling the fear in <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> where &#8220;the wicked flee when no one pursues.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Instead of repentance, Ahab chooses blame-shifting. Earlier he accused Elijah of troubling Israel (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>); now he calls him an enemy. This illustrates how hardened hearts reinterpret truth as attack (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-7.htm">2 Chronicles 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s defensive posture foreshadows the later reaction of Herod to John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-18.htm">Mark 6:18-19</a>): when sin is confronted, hostility often spikes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He replied, &#8220;I have found you out because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the LORD.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Elijah states the divine charge: Ahab has &#8220;sold&#8221; himself. This echoes <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a> and <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>, where choosing sin is depicted as entering bondage.<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the sight of the LORD&#8221; anchors morality in God&#8217;s perspective, not human standards (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>). Every deed is weighed before Him (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Selling oneself suggests a deliberate, calculated trade: Ahab exchanged covenant obedience for temporal gain&#8212;Naboth&#8217;s vineyard&#8212;mirroring Esau&#8217;s careless sale of his birthright (<a href="/genesis/25-33.htm">Genesis 25:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The charge is comprehensive: earlier Scripture tallies Ahab&#8217;s record&#8212;building altars to Baal, instituting Asherah worship, and provoking God more than all the kings before him (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). Elijah&#8217;s indictment consolidates that history.<p>&#8226; Immediate consequences follow (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>): dynastic doom, violent death, and national calamity, aligning with <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s unexpected appearance exposes Ahab&#8217;s hidden sin, revealing that no injustice escapes divine notice. The king&#8217;s hostile greeting exposes a conscience at war with God, while Elijah&#8217;s blunt verdict highlights the self-enslaving nature of deliberate evil. <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a> therefore stands as a timeless reminder that God confronts sin personally, persistently, and righteously, calling every heart either to stubborn resistance like Ahab or to humble repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?--</span>The cry is partly of dismay, partly of excuse. Ahab, having no word of defence to utter, endeavours to attribute Elijah's rebuke and condemnation to simple enmity, much as in <a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he that troubles Israel?">1Kings 18:17</a> he cries out "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" The crushing answer is that the prophet came not because he was an enemy, but because Ahab had "sold himself"--had become a slave instead of a king--under the lust of desire and the temptation of Jezebel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me</span> [Not merely, "Hast thou found me out? hast thou surprised me in the very act?" though this meaning is not to be excluded, but also, "Has thy vengeance overtaken me?" <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;</span> is used in this sense <a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/21-9.htm">Psalm 21:9</a>. Ahab is so conscience stricken by the sudden apparition of Elijah, whom in all probability he had not seen or heard of since "the day of Carmel," and by his appearance on the scene at the very moment when he was entering on the fruit of his misdoing," in the very blossom of his sin," that he feels that judgment is already begun], <span class="cmt_word">O</span> <span class="cmt_word">mine enemy?</span> [No doubt the thought was present in Ahab's mind that Elijah had ever been opposed to him and thwarting him, but he does not dream (Von Gerlach, in Bahr) of justifying himself by ascribing Elijah's intervention to personal hatred towards himself. The sequel shows that he was thoroughly conscious of wrong-doing.] <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, I have found thee: because</span> [not because I am thine enemy, but because] <span class="cmt_word">thou has sold thyself</span> [or <span class="accented">sellest thyself, i.e.</span>, surrenderest thyself wholly. The idea is clearly derived from the institutions of slavery, according to which the bondservant was wholly at his master's disposal and was bound to accomplish his will. Whether "the practice of men selling themselves into slavery" (Rawlinson) existed in that age may perhaps be doubted. We have the same thought in <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>, and <a href="/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>] <span class="cmt_word">to work evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> [We can readily gather from these words why the doom was denounced against Ahab, who had but a secondary share in the crime, rather than against Jezebel, its real perpetrator. It was because Ahab was the representative of God, God's minister of justice, etc. If he had not himself devised the death of Naboth; if he had, which is possible, remained in ignorance of the means by which Jezebel proposed to procure him the vineyard, he had nevertheless readily and gladly acquiesced in her infamous crime after its accomplishment, and was then reaping its fruits. And because he was the king, the judge, who, instead of punishing the evil doer, sanctioned and approved the deed, and who crowned a reign of idolatries and abominations with this shameful murder, the prophetic sentence is directed primarily against him.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Elijah [arrived],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_452.htm">Strong's 452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah -- 'Yah is God', a well-known prophet of Israel, also three other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ahab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
