The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing and divine encounter. Elijah's solitary journey indicates his deep distress and desire to escape from the threats of Jezebel, who sought his life after his victory over the prophets of Baal. The wilderness here is likely the Negev, a harsh and arid region, emphasizing Elijah's desperation and isolation.<p><b>He sat down under a broom tree</b><br>The broom tree, or juniper, is a small desert shrub providing minimal shade, symbolizing Elijah's vulnerability and exhaustion. This setting underscores his physical and spiritual depletion. The broom tree is mentioned elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/job/30-4.htm">Job 30:4</a>, where it is associated with desolation and survival. Its presence highlights the severity of Elijah's situation and his need for divine intervention.<p><b>and prayed that he might die.</b><br>Elijah's prayer for death reveals his profound despair and sense of failure. Despite his recent triumph on Mount Carmel, he feels overwhelmed by the opposition and his perceived ineffectiveness. This moment of vulnerability is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Jonah and Job, who also expressed a desire for death in times of extreme distress. Elijah's prayer indicates a crisis of faith and a need for God's reassurance.<p><b>&#8220;I have had enough, LORD,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Elijah's declaration of having "had enough" reflects his exhaustion and the limits of his endurance. This statement is a candid expression of his human frailty and the emotional toll of his prophetic ministry. It highlights the theme of human limitation and the need for divine strength, a recurring motif in Scripture. Elijah's honesty before God serves as a reminder of the importance of bringing one's burdens to the Lord.<p><b>&#8220;Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's comparison to his ancestors suggests a feeling of inadequacy and failure to live up to the legacy of the prophets before him. This reflects a common biblical theme of self-doubt and the struggle to fulfill one's divine calling. Elijah's lament can be seen as a type of Christ, who also experienced deep anguish in the Garden of Gethsemane. However, unlike Elijah, Jesus fully submitted to the Father's will, highlighting the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ. Elijah's plea underscores the need for divine grace and the assurance that God's purposes prevail despite human weakness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who had just experienced a great victory over the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel but is now fleeing for his life from Queen Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>A desolate place where Elijah retreats, symbolizing both physical and spiritual desolation and isolation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/broom_tree.htm">Broom Tree</a></b><br>A small desert shrub under which Elijah finds temporary shelter and shade, representing a place of rest and reflection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_for_death.htm">Prayer for Death</a></b><br>Elijah's desperate plea to God, expressing his deep despair and sense of failure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/comparison_to_fathers.htm">Comparison to Fathers</a></b><br>Elijah's acknowledgment of his perceived inadequacy and failure in comparison to his ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_human_frailty.htm">Acknowledging Human Frailty</a></b><br>Elijah's experience reminds us that even the most faithful servants of God can experience moments of deep despair and weakness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest_and_reflection.htm">The Importance of Rest and Reflection</a></b><br>Elijah's retreat into the wilderness and rest under the broom tree highlights the need for physical and spiritual rest in times of distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_despair.htm">God's Presence in Despair</a></b><br>Despite Elijah's feelings of abandonment, God is present and ready to provide comfort and guidance, reminding us of His constant presence in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_honest_prayer.htm">The Power of Honest Prayer</a></b><br>Elijah's candid prayer demonstrates the importance of bringing our true feelings and struggles before God, trusting Him with our deepest fears and failures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/finding_strength_in_god's_promises.htm">Finding Strength in God's Promises</a></b><br>In moments of despair, we are encouraged to find strength and hope in God's promises, knowing that He is faithful to sustain us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_19_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 19:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Elijah_s_despair_vs_today_s_struggles.htm">How does Elijah's despair in 1 Kings 19:4 reflect human struggles today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Elijah_s_prayer_in_trials.htm">What can we learn from Elijah's prayer about seeking God's help in trials?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Elijah_s_link_to_Jesus_wilderness_time.htm">How does Elijah's experience connect with Jesus' time in the wilderness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_cope_when_overwhelmed_like_Elijah.htm">What steps can we take when feeling overwhelmed, as Elijah did?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/God_s_response_to_Elijah_our_strength.htm">How does God's response to Elijah encourage us in our own spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Elijah_wish_for_death_in_1_Kings_19.htm">Why did Elijah wish for death in 1 Kings 19:4 despite his faith in God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_19_4_Human_despair_in_adversity.htm">How does 1 Kings 19:4 reflect human vulnerability and despair in the face of adversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Elijah_s_request_human_endurance_limits.htm">What does Elijah's request in 1 Kings 19:4 reveal about the limits of human endurance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_a_'broom_tree'_in_the_bible.htm">What does "broom tree" mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_experience_depression.htm">Can Christians experience depression?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_1_kings_19_fit_with_elijah's_story.htm">How does 1 Kings 19 fit with other biblical accounts of Elijah and the broader historical context, considering potential timeline or narrative discrepancies?

Evidently he had hoped that he himself was "better than his fathers" as a servant of God--singled out beyond all those that went before him, to be the victorious champion of a great crisis, "he, and he alone" (<a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm" title="Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.">1Kings 18:22</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1Kings 19:10-14</a>). Now he thinks his hope vain, and sees no reason why he should succeed when all who went before have failed. Why, he asks, should he live when the rest of the prophets have died?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness</span> [Cf. <a href="/genesis/21-14.htm">Genesis 21:14, 21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-2.htm">Jeremiah 9:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>.

It is probable that from the first, "Horeb, the mount of God," was in his thoughts. He may well have seen that he was destined to be a second Moses; that he was raised up to assert and enforce the covenant of which Moses was the mediator. We have seen already that he cites the words spoken to Moses at the bush (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36</a>); that to him as to Moses there was granted an apparition of fire; we now find him rejected as Moses had been before him (<a href="/acts/7-25.htm">Acts 7:25, 35</a>). How natural that, like Moses, he should flee into the land of Midian, to the place where God had spoken With Moses face to face.

It does not, however, afford a complete protection (Thomson, L. and B. vol. 2. pp. 436, 437). Every traveller remarks on its abundance in the desert; it gave a name, <span class="accented">Rithmah</span>, to one of the stations of the Israelites (<a href="/numbers/33-18.htm">Numbers 33:18</a>.

Time was when he had thought himself a most special messenger of Heaven, raised up to effect the regeneration of his country. He now thinks his work is fruitless, and he has nothing to live for longer. Keil concludes from these words that Elijah was already of a great age, but this is extremely doubtful.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">while he himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
