His actions demonstrate a profound trust in God's provision and guidance. This obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures such as Abraham, who also followed God's instructions without hesitation (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>). Elijah's compliance sets a precedent for the prophetic ministry, emphasizing the importance of heeding God's voice. This obedience is a model for believers, illustrating the principle that faith is often demonstrated through action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>and he went and lived by the Brook of Cherith</b><br>The Brook of Cherith is a significant location, providing a place of refuge and sustenance for Elijah during a time of drought and famine. This brook is believed to be a seasonal stream, which would have been a hidden and secluded place, offering safety from King Ahab and Jezebel's pursuit. The name "Cherith" means "cutting" or "separation," symbolizing a period of isolation and preparation for Elijah. This time by the brook can be seen as a period of spiritual renewal and dependence on God, similar to Jesus' time in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>east of the Jordan</b><br>The geographical reference to the location east of the Jordan River places Elijah outside the immediate reach of the northern kingdom of Israel, where Ahab reigned. This area, often associated with the Transjordan, was historically a place of refuge and transition for many biblical figures, including Jacob (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>) and the Israelites during their journey to the Promised Land (Numbers 32). The east of the Jordan also holds eschatological significance, as it is often seen as a place of preparation before entering into God's promises. Elijah's time here foreshadows his later role in preparing the way for the Lord, much like John the Baptist, who ministered in the wilderness (<a href="/luke/3-2.htm">Luke 3:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his boldness and faithfulness.

James writes, &#8220;Faith without works is dead&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>), and Jesus connects love with obedience: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s directives are trustworthy. He never misleads His servants (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). By acting promptly, Elijah affirms the literal reliability of every divine instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he went</b><p>&#8226; Faith moves feet. &#8220;By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out&#8230;not knowing where he was going&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>). Elijah likewise rises and travels without delay.<p>&#8226; Action completes the command. It is one thing to agree mentally; it is another to get moving (<a href="/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28-31</a>).<p>&#8226; God often guides in stages&#8212;obey the first step, and the next becomes clear (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lived by the Brook of Cherith</b><p>&#8226; God leads Elijah to seclusion, shielding him from Ahab&#8217;s wrath (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). The brook becomes both hiding place and training ground.<p>&#8211; Protection: &#8220;You are my hiding place; You preserve me from trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-7.htm">Psalm 32:7</a>).<p>&#8211; Provision: &#8220;The ravens would bring him bread and meat morning and evening, and he would drink from the brook&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Solitude deepens dependence. Away from crowds and acclaim, Elijah learns that God alone sustains (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>east of the Jordan</b><p>&#8226; Specific geography highlights God&#8217;s precise care. He doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;somewhere near water&#8221;; He pinpoints latitude and longitude.<p>&#8226; The east side signifies separation. Israel once camped east of the Jordan before entering the land (<a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>); here Elijah waits east of the river before re-entering to confront Ahab again (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God is sovereign over places as well as people (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>), directing Elijah exactly where His purpose will unfold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/17-5.htm">1 Kings 17:5</a> showcases simple, sturdy faith. Elijah hears, obeys, moves, and settles exactly where God says. In that humble brookside retreat he discovers divine protection, daily provision, and deeper preparation for future ministry. The verse reminds us that blessing follows obedience, action follows faith, and every detail of God&#8217;s Word is accurate, literal, and life-shaping.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he went and did</span> according <span class="cmt_word">auto the word of the Lord: for</span> [<span class="cmt_word">Heb. <span class="accented">and</span></span>] <span class="cmt_word">he went and dwelt by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/17-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Elijah] did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
