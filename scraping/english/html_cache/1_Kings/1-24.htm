Nathan is a key figure in David's court, known for his role in confronting David about his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>). His approach here is diplomatic, reflecting the courtly protocol of addressing a reigning monarch. Nathan's involvement underscores the importance of prophetic voices in guiding Israel's leadership, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;did you say,</b><br>Nathan's question is strategic, designed to clarify David's intentions regarding the succession. This reflects the importance of clear communication in leadership transitions, especially in a monarchy where ambiguity can lead to conflict. The question also implies that Nathan is aware of the political maneuvering by Adonijah and seeks to confirm the king's official stance.<p><b>&#8216;Adonijah will reign after me,</b><br>Adonijah, David's fourth son, is attempting to claim the throne without David's explicit endorsement. This phrase highlights the tension and potential for division within the royal family. Adonijah's actions parallel those of Absalom, another of David's sons who previously attempted to usurp the throne (2 Samuel 15). The issue of succession is critical, as it affects the stability of the kingdom and the fulfillment of God's promises to David's lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and he will sit on my throne&#8217;?</b><br>The throne symbolizes legitimate authority and the continuation of David's dynasty. Nathan's inquiry points to the need for divine guidance in choosing a successor, as seen in the anointing of David himself (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). The throne of David is also significant in biblical prophecy, as it is linked to the messianic promise that Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, will ultimately reign (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).

Scripture repeatedly teaches respect for authority&#8212;even flawed human authority&#8212;because it originates with God (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). David himself modeled this when he refused to harm Saul, saying, &#8220;I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). By echoing that title, Nathan reminds David&#8212;and the readers&#8212;of the king&#8217;s accountability before the Lord who placed him on the throne.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said Nathan</b><p>The prophet&#8217;s presence signals that God is speaking into the political crisis.<p>&#8226; Nathan had already been God&#8217;s mouthpiece to David regarding temple plans (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1&#8211;17</a>) and personal sin (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets in Israel were charged to confront, correct, and guide kings (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His appearance after Bathsheba&#8217;s appeal (<a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11&#8211;14</a>) shows a coordinated effort to uphold God&#8217;s revealed will that Solomon, not Adonijah, succeed David (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>Nathan&#8217;s faithfully prophetic stance illustrates <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>: &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend,&#8221; for he risks displeasing the aging king to safeguard God&#8217;s promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did you say</b><p>Nathan frames his words as a question, inviting David to clarify. This approach<p>&#8226; protects the king&#8217;s dignity,<p>&#8226; avoids open accusation, and<p>&#8226; allows David to reaffirm or correct the record.<p><a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> notes, &#8220;Victory is won through many advisers,&#8221; and Nathan acts as that trusted counselor. The gravity of a royal word is clear from <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>, &#8220;a decree written in the king&#8217;s name and sealed with his ring cannot be revoked,&#8221; so Nathan seeks certainty before action is taken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Adonijah will reign after me</b><p>Adonijah had already exalted himself, saying, &#8220;I will be king&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>), mirroring Absalom&#8217;s earlier rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>). Yet God had pledged the throne to Solomon: &#8220;Behold, a son will be born to you&#8230; I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>). Nathan&#8217;s question exposes the tension between man&#8217;s ambition and God&#8217;s decree. It presses David to reaffirm what the Lord had spoken, guarding against a coup that would derail the covenant line leading to Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will sit on my throne&#8217;?</b><p>The throne symbolized not merely political power but the unfolding promise of a perpetual Davidic dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a> underscores, &#8220;David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.&#8221; Ultimately, <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32</a> announces that Jesus &#8220;will be given the throne of His father David.&#8221; Nathan&#8217;s probing question forces David to act so the rightful heir, prefiguring Messiah, will indeed &#8220;sit on my throne,&#8221; fulfilling God&#8217;s unbroken plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nathan&#8217;s respectful yet urgent inquiry highlights three truths: the necessity of honoring God-ordained authority, the courage of prophetic counsel that safeguards divine promises, and the certainty that God&#8217;s word&#8212;not human ambition&#8212;determines who occupies the throne. By prompting David to reaffirm Solomon&#8217;s succession, <a href="/1_kings/1-24.htm">1 Kings 1:24</a> preserves the covenant line that leads to Christ, demonstrating God&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness to His literal promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Hast thou said.</span>--The question here and in <a href="/1_kings/1-27.htm" title="Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it to your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?">1Kings 1:27</a> is, of course, merely intended to draw out denial; but it is singularly true to nature that it does so by the assumption (natural in court language) that nothing of such a kind could be even conceived as done without the king's will. There is something striking in the contrast of the deference of Nathan as a counsellor on state business with the bold superiority of his tone in the discharge of his true prophetic office (as in <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-2.htm" title="That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.">2Samuel 7:2-17</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David.
