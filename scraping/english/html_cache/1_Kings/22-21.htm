This scene reflects the belief in a spiritual realm where God interacts with His creation through various agents. The "spirit" here is not named, suggesting a focus on the function rather than identity. This aligns with other biblical instances where God uses spiritual beings to accomplish His purposes, such as in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>.<p><b>stood before the LORD</b><br>Standing before the LORD indicates a position of readiness to serve and act according to God's command. This phrase emphasizes the sovereignty of God, who presides over the heavenly host. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice where subjects would stand before a king to receive orders, highlighting the divine council's hierarchical structure.<p><b>and said, &#8216;I will entice him.&#8217;</b><br>The spirit's proposal to entice Ahab reveals the divine allowance for human free will and the use of spiritual means to fulfill God's judgment. The term "entice" suggests a plan to lead Ahab into a decision that aligns with God's judgment against him, as prophesied earlier in <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>. This reflects the biblical theme of God using both good and evil to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>&#8216;By what means?&#8217; asked the LORD.</b><br>God's question indicates His sovereign control and the deliberative process within the divine council. It shows that God is not the author of evil but permits certain actions within His overarching plan. This interaction underscores the biblical principle that God allows human and spiritual agents to operate within the boundaries of His will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares His control over both peace and calamity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his idolatry and opposition to God's prophets.

Others take the phrase to signify "the spirit of prophecy," a kind of emanation from the Godhead, looked upon as the medium of the prophetic inspiration, which is an expression conceivable, but certainly unprecedented. Perhaps without introducing into this passage the distinct idea of "the Satan," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the enemy, which we find in Job 1, 2; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1-2</a>. it may be best to interpret it by the conception, common to all religions recognising the terrible existence of evil in the world, of a spiritual power of evil (called euphemistically, "the spirit") overruled to work out the judgments of God. The absolute subordination of such spirits of evil in every notice of them in the Old Testament precludes all danger of the monstrous dualism of so many Eastern religions. The reference of the power of divination to such spirits is found in the New Testament also. (See <a href="/context/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came forth a spirit</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the spirit</span>.
