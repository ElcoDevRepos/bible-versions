Her visit signifies the far-reaching reputation of Solomon's wisdom and wealth. This fame was not merely about Solomon's personal achievements but was intrinsically linked to his relationship with God. The fame of Solomon had spread across the ancient world, indicating the extent of Israel's influence during his reign. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make Solomon renowned (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12-13</a>).<p><b>concerning the name of the LORD</b><br>Solomon's wisdom and prosperity were attributed to his relationship with the LORD, the covenant God of Israel. The phrase underscores that Solomon's fame was not just for his own sake but was a testimony to the power and blessing of God. This aligns with the biblical theme that Israel was to be a light to the nations, showcasing the glory of God (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The Queen of Sheba's interest in Solomon's wisdom was, therefore, an interest in the God who granted it.<p><b>she came to test him with difficult questions</b><br>The Queen's journey was not merely diplomatic but also intellectual and spiritual. In the ancient Near East, rulers often engaged in exchanges of wisdom and riddles as a way to test each other's knowledge and understanding. Her testing of Solomon with difficult questions indicates a genuine quest for truth and understanding. This encounter prefigures the New Testament account of the Magi seeking Jesus, the true wisdom of God (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-12</a>). Solomon, as a type of Christ, foreshadows the ultimate wisdom and truth found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_of_sheba.htm">Queen of Sheba</a></b><br>A monarch from a wealthy and distant land, often associated with the region of modern-day Yemen or Ethiopia.

Seba is, indeed, with great probability identified (see Jos. Ant. ii. 10, 2) with the Ethiopian city and island of Meroe. It is probably from confusion between Sheba and Saba that Josephus (Ant. viii. 6, 5) represents the queen of Sheba as a "queen of Egypt and Ethiopia." (<span class= "ital">b</span>) The name "Sheba" is found in the ethnological lists of <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm" title="And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.">Genesis 10:7</a>, among the descendants of Cush of the Hamite race, in <a href="/genesis/10-28.htm" title="And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,">Genesis 10:28</a>, among the Semitic Joktanites, and in <a href="/genesis/25-3.htm" title="And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan.

The kingdom of Sheba referred to in this passage must certainly be placed in Arabia Felix, the habitation of the Joktanite race (in which the Keturahites appear to have been merged), for the Cushite Sheba is probably to be found elsewhere on the Persian Gulf.

It is true that while <a href="/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a> (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>) speaks of Sheba, the son of <span class="accented">Joktan</span>, one of the colonists of southern Arabia, <a href="/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a> mention another Sheba, the son of <span class="accented">Cush</span>, and a doubt has arisen whether this was an Arabian or an Ethiopian princess, and it is alleged that she was the latter by Josephus, who calls her "queen of Egypt and Ethopia," and by some Rabbinical writers, and in the traditions of the Abyssinian church. But the kingdoms of Sheba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Saba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) are entirely distinct (<a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>), the latter being the name both of the capital and country of Meroe, a province of Ethopia (Joshua, Ant. 2:10. 2); while the former in like manner designates both the chief city and also the kingdom of the Sabeans (<a href="/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>). This tribe would seem to have grown richer and stronger than all the other Arabian peoples by means of its commercial enterprise, and it was especially famed for its gold, gems, and spices (<a href="/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>). It is noticeable that in both kingdoms government by female sovereigns was not uncommon (cf. <a href="/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>); but it is very remarkable to find any country under the rule of a queen at this early date. (The idea that either of these lands was <span class="accented">always</span> governed by queens has no real basis.) The name of this princess, according to the Koran, was <span class="accented">Balkis</span>, according to Abyssinian belief, <span class="accented">Maqueda</span>. Whether she was a widow or virgin is unknown] <span class="cmt_word">heard</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">hearing</span>. Doubtless through the Arab traders. The record of this visit, following immediately upon the mention of the voyages (<a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>), is a grain of evidence in favour of locating Ophir in Arabia] <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the fame</span> (Heb. <span class="accented">hearing</span>; cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span>, which also means <span class="accented">the thing heard, report</span>.

But the expression is somewhat unusual, and these words are omitted by the chronicler. Gesenius and Ewald, however, regard the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as instrumental, "the fame given him by the name," etc., as <a href="/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm">Ezekiel 12:12</a>, etc., and Wordsworth compares the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> in Greek. The LXX. and other versions read "the name of Solomon and the name of the Lord." But the text is on every ground to be retained. The alliteration in this verse (probably accidental) is to be noticed. There is also a slight <span class="accented">paronomasia</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the Lord, she came to prove</span> (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">to test</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">him with hard</span> <span class="cmt_word">questions</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in riddles</span>; LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>. The Arabian mind has ever delighted in dark sayings, enigmas, etc., and extensive collections of these have been made by Burckhardt and others (see Keil <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) According to Dius (cited in Josephus, Contra Ap. 1:17. 18) Solomon also had dialectical encounters with Hiram and with Abdemon, or, according to Menander, a younger son of Abdemon, a man of Tyre.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now when the queen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mal&#183;ka&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
