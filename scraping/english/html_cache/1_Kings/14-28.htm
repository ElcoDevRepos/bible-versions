The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites. The king's entry into the temple signifies his role as a leader who is expected to honor and uphold the worship of Yahweh. This practice reflects the importance of the temple as a spiritual and political center. The king's presence in the temple underscores the connection between the monarchy and religious observance, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>the guards would bear the shields</b><br>The guards carrying shields symbolize protection and honor. These shields were likely made of bronze, as gold shields had been taken by Shishak, king of Egypt, earlier in the chapter. The act of bearing shields during the king's temple visit highlights the ceremonial aspect of the king's duties and the reverence associated with the temple. Shields in ancient times were not only for defense but also served as symbols of strength and authority. This practice may also reflect the need for security and the display of royal power even in sacred spaces.<p><b>and later they would return them to the guardroom</b><br>Returning the shields to the guardroom suggests a routine and organized approach to temple visits. The guardroom was a place for storing weapons and armor, indicating the importance of maintaining order and readiness. This detail emphasizes the structured nature of temple worship and the integration of military elements into religious practices. It also reflects the transient nature of earthly power and glory, as the shields, once used for display, are put away, symbolizing the temporary nature of human achievements compared to the eternal presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_rehoboam.htm">King Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah, whose reign is marked by the division of the united kingdom and spiritual decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards.htm">Guards</a></b><br>The royal guards responsible for the protection of the king and the temple, tasked with carrying and returning the shields.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shields.htm">Shields</a></b><br>Originally gold shields made by Solomon, later replaced with bronze by Rehoboam after the Egyptian invasion, symbolizing a decline in glory and wealth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/guardroom.htm">Guardroom</a></b><br>The place where the shields were stored, indicating a shift from public display to a more hidden, less glorious state.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_decline_and_consequences.htm">Spiritual Decline and Consequences</a></b><br>Rehoboam's reign illustrates how turning away from God leads to loss and decline, both spiritually and materially.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_shields.htm">Symbolism of the Shields</a></b><br>The transition from gold to bronze shields symbolizes a loss of divine favor and glory, reminding us to maintain our spiritual integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_what_is_sacred.htm">Guarding What is Sacred</a></b><br>The role of the guards in protecting the temple and its treasures underscores the importance of safeguarding our faith and values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/temporary_vs._eternal_wealth.htm">Temporary vs. Eternal Wealth</a></b><br>The replacement of gold with bronze challenges us to consider where we place our trust and value&#8212;on earthly possessions or eternal treasures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_repentance.htm">Restoration and Repentance</a></b><br>Despite the decline, there is always an opportunity for repentance and restoration, as seen in the broader account of Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_14_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 14:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_14_28_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does 1 Kings 14:28 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God?
