It implies a communal understanding and acknowledgment of the reasons behind the nation's suffering. This anticipates a time of reflection and explanation, often seen in the aftermath of judgment.<p><b>&#8216;Because they have forsaken the LORD their God</b><br>Forsaking the LORD indicates a deliberate turning away from the covenant relationship established between God and Israel. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a> and <a href="/joshua/24-20.htm">Joshua 24:20</a>, where forsaking God leads to dire consequences. The covenant was central to Israel's identity, and abandoning it was tantamount to rejecting their chosen status.<p><b>who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt,</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of God's past acts of salvation and the basis for Israel's obligation to remain faithful. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's power and love (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p><b>and have embraced other gods,</b><br>Embracing other gods signifies idolatry, a recurring sin in Israel's history. This act of spiritual adultery is condemned throughout the scriptures (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). It reflects a breach of the first commandment and a turning to the practices of surrounding nations, which were often associated with moral and spiritual corruption.<p><b>worshiping and serving them&#8212;</b><br>Worship and service to other gods indicate a complete devotion and submission, which should have been reserved for the LORD alone. This behavior is seen as a betrayal of the exclusive worship demanded by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-14</a>). It highlights the seriousness of idolatry as not just a cultural practice but a spiritual allegiance.<p><b>because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The disaster refers to the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness, often manifested as military defeat, exile, or other forms of judgment. This is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. Theologically, it underscores the principle of divine retribution and the seriousness of covenantal disobedience. This also foreshadows the eventual exile of Israel and Judah, serving as a historical and prophetic warning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered the Israelites from Egypt and established them in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are warned about the consequences of forsaking their covenant with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>The false deities that the Israelites are warned against worshiping, representing idolatry and spiritual adultery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disaster.htm">Disaster</a></b><br>The consequences or judgment that comes upon the Israelites for their unfaithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>The importance of remaining faithful to God and His commandments.

Israel&#8217;s deliberate abandonment of the redeeming LORD, its affectionate embrace of idols, and its persistent idol worship brought about divine judgment exactly as promised. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God keeps His word&#8212;in blessing and in discipline&#8212;and that wholehearted loyalty to Him is non-negotiable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Brought . . . out of the land of Egypt.</span>--This is appealed to here in exactly a converse sense to the mention of it in Solomon's prayer. There it was made the ground for pleading with the Lord for His continued favour (see <a href="/context/1_kings/8-51.htm" title="For they be your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the middle of the furnace of iron:">1Kings 8:51-53</a>); here for His claim of the undivided allegiance of the people, for it marked His new "covenant" with the people, now become a nation (see <a href="/jeremiah/31-32.htm" title="Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was an husband to them, said the LORD:">Jeremiah 31:32</a>), and therefore involved (as in all covenants) reciprocal claims. Afterwards the deliverance from Babylon was to take its place, both as a proof of God's love and a motive for the loyal obedience of the people (<a href="/context/jeremiah/16-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt</span> [Based on <a href="/deuteronomy/29-25.htm">Deuteronomy 29:25</a>.

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz., <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to indicate the resources which enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs.
