The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful passing and a joining with ancestors. Jehoshaphat was known for his religious reforms and efforts to bring the people of Judah back to the worship of Yahweh, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17.htm">2 Chronicles 17-20</a>. His reign was marked by relative peace and prosperity, and he is often remembered for his alliance with Ahab, king of Israel, which was both politically and religiously significant.<p><b>and was buried with them in the city of his father David.</b><br>Jehoshaphat was buried in the City of David, which is a term used for Jerusalem, specifically the oldest settled part of the city. This burial place signifies honor and continuity with the Davidic line, emphasizing the legitimacy and divine favor upon the Davidic dynasty. The City of David is archaeologically significant, with numerous excavations revealing insights into the period of the united monarchy. The burial of kings in this location underscores their connection to King David, the revered founder of the dynasty.<p><b>And his son Jehoram reigned in his place.</b><br>Jehoram's succession to the throne marks a continuation of the Davidic line, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). However, Jehoram's reign was notably different from his father's, as he led Judah into idolatry and faced significant challenges, including revolts and invasions. His marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, further influenced his departure from the religious reforms of Jehoshaphat. This transition highlights the recurring biblical theme of the faithfulness of God contrasted with the unfaithfulness of human leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow God's ways and for his reforms to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh.
