His approach to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, is significant as it reflects the political dynamics and tensions within the royal family. Bathsheba holds a position of influence as the queen mother, a role of considerable power in the ancient Near Eastern monarchies. Adonijah's visit suggests a strategic move, possibly seeking her intercession with Solomon. This encounter occurs after Solomon's ascension, highlighting the unresolved ambitions and potential threats to his reign.<p><b>and she asked, &#8220;Do you come in peace?&#8221;</b><br>Bathsheba's question indicates her awareness of the potential threat Adonijah poses. In the context of ancient Israel, visits from rival claimants to the throne could be fraught with danger. Her inquiry reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that Adonijah's intentions are not hostile. This question also underscores the tension and suspicion that lingered after Solomon's establishment as king, as Adonijah's previous actions had already demonstrated his willingness to challenge the rightful succession.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, in peace,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Adonijah's response is an assurance of his peaceful intentions, at least outwardly. This declaration is crucial in the context of royal court politics, where any hint of rebellion or conspiracy could lead to severe consequences. His affirmation of peace may be seen as an attempt to allay fears and possibly to negotiate or seek favor. However, given his history, his words might be met with skepticism. This interaction sets the stage for the subsequent request he makes, which ultimately reveals his continued ambition and leads to his downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David and Haggith, Adonijah was a contender for the throne of Israel.

The historian now relates the plot of Adonijah and its defeat. Foiled in his purpose to mount the throne by direct means, Adonijah and his advisers have recourse to intrigue and subtlety. By the aid of Abishag, he hopes to accomplish what his chariots and horsemen (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>) had failed to effect. And he first addresses himself to the queen mother (<span class="accented">"Aggreditur mulierem, ut regnandi ignaram ira amoribus facilem."</span> Grotius). The position of the queen dowager m the Hebrew kingdom was an influential one; not unlike that of the Valide sultana amongst the Ottomans. Hence the constant mention of each king's mother (<a href="/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a>, where notice ver. 13; <a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>, etc.; hence, too, the part which such a queen mother as Athaliah found it possible to take.
