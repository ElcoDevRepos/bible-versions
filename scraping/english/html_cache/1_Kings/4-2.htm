Solomon's reign is marked by wisdom and prosperity, and his officials played crucial roles in maintaining the kingdom's stability. The mention of "chief officials" reflects the importance of leadership and delegation in governance, a principle seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>, where Moses appoints leaders to help judge the people.<p><b>Azariah son of Zadok was the priest;</b><br>Azariah, identified as the son of Zadok, serves as a priest during Solomon's reign. Zadok was a prominent priest during the time of David and Solomon, known for his loyalty and righteousness (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>). The priesthood was a vital institution in Israel, responsible for religious duties and maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people. Azariah's role signifies the continuation of Zadok's priestly line, which is significant as the Zadokite priesthood is later emphasized in Ezekiel's vision of the future temple (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>). This continuity underscores the importance of faithfulness and divine appointment in spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah</a></b><br>Azariah is identified as the son of Zadok and serves as a priest.

This mirrors David&#8217;s earlier cabinet list in <a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15-18</a>, signaling continuity between father and son.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores order and accountability. Solomon&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>) shows up first in how he structures leadership rather than in flashy achievements.<p>&#8226; Cross references such as <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a> and <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-23</a> reinforce that God values orderly governance under His authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Azariah son of Zadok</b><p>&#8220;Azariah son of Zadok&#8221; identifies the first name in Solomon&#8217;s lineup.<p>&#8226; Zadok, Azariah&#8217;s father, was the faithful priest who remained loyal to David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>) and was rewarded by being placed over the priesthood when Abiathar was removed (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>).<p>&#8226; By listing the son, Scripture highlights generational faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/103-17.htm">Psalm 103:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). God honors Zadok by allowing his line to serve in the highest spiritual office.<p>&#8226; It also signals covenant stability: the same family that upheld worship under David now upholds it under Solomon, foreshadowing later promises in <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a> regarding Zadok&#8217;s descendants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was the priest</b><p>&#8220;was the priest&#8221; specifies Azariah&#8217;s role.<p>&#8226; Only one man is called &#8220;the priest,&#8221; indicating chief priestly authority&#8212;comparable to the high priest (<a href="/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing this office first underscores that spiritual leadership outranks civil offices (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>). Solomon&#8217;s administration begins with worship, not warfare or commerce (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8226; This confirms that the temple soon to be built (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6&#8211;8</a>) will rest on a faithful priestly foundation, fulfilling God&#8217;s word in <a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-2.htm">1 Kings 4:2</a> stresses that Solomon&#8217;s kingdom is ordered, covenant-rooted, and worship-centered. By spotlighting Azariah, the son of loyal Zadok, as &#8220;the priest,&#8221; Scripture affirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to reward steadfast obedience and sets the tone for Solomon&#8217;s reign: true wisdom begins with honoring God&#8217;s appointed spiritual leadership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And these were.</span>--The officers described are of two classes--those attached to Solomon's Court, and those invested with local authority.<p><span class= "bld">The princes </span>are evidently Solomon's high counsellors and officers, "eating at the king's table." The word is derived from a root which means to "set in order." It is significant that whereas in the lists of David's officers in <a href="/context/2_samuel/8-16.htm" title="And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;">2Samuel 8:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2Samuel 20:23-26</a>, the captain of the host stands first, and is followed in one list by the captain of the body-guard, both are here preceded by the peaceful offices of the priests, scribes, and the recorder.<p><span class= "bld">Azariah the son of Zadok the priest.</span>--In <a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-9.htm" title="And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,">1Chronicles 6:9-10</a>, we find Azariah described as the son of Ahimaaz, and so grandson of Zadok; and the note in <a href="/1_kings/4-10.htm" title="The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:">1Kings 4:10</a> (which is apparently out of its right place) seems to show that he was high priest at the time when the Temple was built. The title the "priest" in this place must be given by anticipation, for it is expressly said below that "Zadok and Abiathar were now the priests." The use of the original word, <span class= "ital">Cohen </span>(probably signifying "one who ministers"), appears sometimes to retain traces of the old times, when the priesthood and headship of the family were united, and to be applied accordingly to princes, to whom perhaps still attached something of the ancient privilege. Thus it is given to the sons of David in <a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>, where the parallel passage in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a> has a paraphrase, "chief about the king," evidently intended to explain the sense in which it is used in the older record. We may remember that David himself on occasions wore the priestly ephod (see <a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>). Possibly in this sense it is applied in <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a> to Zabud, the "king's friend" (where the Authorised Version renders it by <span class= "ital">"</span>principal officer"). But in this verse there is every reason for taking it in the usual sense. Azariah was already a "prince" before he succeeded to the high priesthood. The mingling, of priestly and princely functions is characteristic of the time. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these were the princes</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> ministers, officers.
