The "hall for the throne" signifies a place of authority and governance, reflecting Solomon's role as king. The throne hall was part of a larger architectural project that included the Temple and other royal buildings, showcasing Solomon's wealth and wisdom. The throne itself symbolizes judgment and leadership, echoing the biblical theme of kingship established in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a> when Israel requested a king to lead them.<p><b>the Hall of Justice</b><br>The "Hall of Justice" indicates a designated space for legal proceedings and the administration of justice. This reflects the biblical principle of justice as a key responsibility of a king, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges are commanded to judge fairly. Solomon's wisdom in judgment is famously illustrated in <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>, where he resolves a dispute between two women claiming to be the mother of a child. The hall's name underscores the importance of justice in maintaining social order and righteousness in Israel.<p><b>where he was to judge</b><br>This phrase highlights Solomon's role as the chief judge of Israel, a duty that required discernment and wisdom. The king's judgments were seen as divinely guided, as Solomon had asked God for wisdom to govern the people (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). The act of judging was not only a legal function but also a spiritual one, as it involved upholding God's laws and ensuring the community's adherence to them. This role prefigures Christ as the ultimate judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>, where Jesus is given authority to judge.<p><b>It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling</b><br>The use of cedar wood, a valuable and durable material, signifies the grandeur and permanence of the hall. Cedar was imported from Lebanon, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, and was a symbol of wealth and prestige. The extensive use of cedar in Solomon's buildings, including the Temple, reflects the king's desire to create structures that honor God and demonstrate the kingdom's prosperity. The cedar paneling also points to the craftsmanship and attention to detail in Solomon's construction projects, paralleling the care and precision in God's creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wisdom and wealth, who commissioned the construction of the temple and his royal palace, including the Hall of Judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hall_of_the_throne_/_hall_of_judgment.htm">Hall of the Throne / Hall of Judgment</a></b><br>A significant part of Solomon's palace complex, where he would render judgments and govern the people.

It is, perhaps, not quite so certain that "this porch was the gem and centre of the whole empire," or that because it was so much thought of a similar but smaller porch was erected for the queen (ver. 8) ("Jewish Ch.," 2. p. 195)]: <span class="cmt_word">and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</span> [Heb. from <span class="accented">the floor to the floor</span>, as marg.

Keil thinks the ceiling served as the floor of an upper story, built over the porch of judgment, but, as Bahr observes, no such upper story is even hinted at elsewhere.
