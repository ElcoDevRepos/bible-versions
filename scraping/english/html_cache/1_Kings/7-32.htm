Each stand had exactly four wheels, showing a balanced, stable platform that could be moved as needed.<p>&#8226; The wheels were not ornamental; they allowed the huge water-filled lavers (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>) to be rolled near the altar for the priests&#8217; continual washing, a duty set out earlier in <a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>.<p>&#8226; By recording this practical detail, Scripture underscores God&#8217;s concern for order and usability in worship, not only beauty (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). The number four often points to completeness within creation (e.g., the four winds in <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>), yet here it is first and foremost literal&#8212;four real wheels under every real panel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Attached&#8221; means the axles were cast as one piece with the stand (<a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a>), forming a single, sturdy unit. The laver could move, but it would never wobble or separate from its base.<p>&#8226; This combination of mobility and firmness pictures how God&#8217;s presence travels with His people while remaining unshakable (compare <a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33-36</a> with <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Craftsmanship of this caliber fulfilled the Lord&#8217;s earlier promise to fill Bezalel&#8212;and now Hiram&#8212;with &#8220;skill, ability, and knowledge in every kind of craftsmanship&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13-14</a>). God equips His servants to build what He commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each wheel was a cubit and a half in diameter</b><p>&#8226; A cubit and a half is about twenty-seven inches (roughly 68 cm). The measurement is precise because the objects were real, measurable items, not merely symbolic notions (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> gives the exact size of the Sea in the same way).<p>&#8226; Wheels of that size could bear the heavy bronze laver filled with &#8220;forty baths&#8221; of water (around 9,200 liters, <a href="/1_kings/7-38.htm">1 Kings 7:38</a>) while staying low enough for the priests to reach inside easily.<p>&#8226; This detail reminds us that God values accuracy: &#8220;Every word of God is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>). The same reliability that governs these inches and cubits guarantees the trustworthiness of the gospel itself (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-32.htm">1 Kings 7:32</a> describes real wheels, real axles, and real measurements on the bronze stands Solomon placed in the temple courtyards.
