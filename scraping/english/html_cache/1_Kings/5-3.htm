It suggests that the events being discussed were well-known and significant in the region. This reflects the close diplomatic relations between Israel and Tyre, which were established during David's reign and continued under Solomon.<p><b>due to the wars waged on all sides against my father David</b><br>David's reign was marked by numerous military conflicts, as recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel. These wars were both defensive and offensive, aimed at securing Israel's borders and establishing dominance over surrounding nations. The Philistines, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, and Arameans were among the adversaries. This context highlights the turbulent period of David's rule, which was necessary for establishing peace and security in Israel.<p><b>he could not build a house for the Name of the LORD his God</b><br>David's desire to build a temple for God is documented in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. However, God did not permit him to do so because he was a warrior king with bloodshed on his hands (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8</a>). The "house for the Name of the LORD" refers to the temple, which would serve as a central place of worship and symbolize God's presence among His people. This task was reserved for Solomon, David's son, who would reign during a time of peace.<p><b>until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet</b><br>This phrase signifies the complete subjugation of David's enemies, a fulfillment of God's promise to give David rest from his adversaries (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>). The imagery of placing enemies under one's feet is a common biblical metaphor for victory and dominion (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ, who is prophesied to have all things under His feet (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-27</a>), symbolizing His authority and triumph over all powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.

The verse highlights shared historical memory, the reality of conflict, submission to God&#8217;s timing, and the divine source of victory&#8212;preparing the way for a house where His Name would dwell.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Thou knowest.</span>--In the description (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-4.htm" title="Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.">1Chronicles 22:4</a>) of David's collection of materials for the Temple, it is noted that "the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David." Hence Hiram knew well his desire of building the Temple, and the care with which, when disappointed of it, he prepared for the happier experience of his successor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house</span> [Hiram could not fail to know this, as his relations with David had been close and intimate.
