His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. Asa's acts include his commitment to the worship of Yahweh and his removal of pagan altars and high places. His reign is characterized by a return to the covenantal faithfulness that was expected of the kings of Judah.<p><b>along with all his might</b><br>Asa demonstrated considerable strength and leadership during his reign. He fortified cities and built up the military, which was crucial in defending Judah against external threats, such as the invasion by Zerah the Ethiopian. His might is also seen in his ability to maintain peace for much of his reign, attributed to his reliance on God.<p><b>all his accomplishments</b><br>Asa's accomplishments include religious reforms, military victories, and infrastructure development. He is credited with bringing about a spiritual revival in Judah by removing idols and restoring the altar of the Lord. His military success against the Cushites and his alliances with neighboring nations like Aram are also notable.<p><b>and the cities he built</b><br>Asa fortified several cities, which was a common practice for kings to protect their territories. These fortifications were strategic for defense and control over trade routes. Archaeological evidence of such fortifications provides insight into the period's military architecture and urban planning.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that a more detailed account of Asa's reign was recorded in a historical document known as the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. This book is distinct from the biblical Chronicles and served as a royal archive. It suggests that the biblical account is a summary, with more comprehensive records available elsewhere.<p><b>In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet.</b><br>Asa's disease in his feet, likely gout or a similar condition, is mentioned as a significant event in his later years. This ailment is seen as a turning point, as it led to a reliance on physicians rather than seeking the Lord's help, as noted in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>.

Though the royal annals are lost, God preserved every essential detail in the canon. We can trust that:<p>&#8226; Divine revelation is complete for life and godliness (<a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word stands even when human archives perish (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet.</b><p><a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a> adds, &#8220;Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but only the physicians.&#8221; The closing note is sober: a life largely marked by faith faltered near the finish line. Takeaways include:<p>&#8226; Past faithfulness does not guarantee present dependence (<a href="/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Seek God first in every trial, including physical affliction (<a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Finishing well requires continual humility (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-23.htm">1 Kings 15:23</a> compresses Asa&#8217;s decades into a single sentence that applauds his strength, reforms, and construction yet records his late-life ailment. The verse urges us to value a lifetime of obedient service, to steward seasons of peace, and to rely on the Lord to the very end.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">All his might.</span>--This phrase, not used of Rehoboam or Abijah, is significant, indicating the increased power of Judah under Asa.<span class= "bld"><p>The cities which he built.</span>--Fortification of cities (see <a href="/context/2_chronicles/11-5.htm" title="And Rehoboam dwelled in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.">2Chronicles 11:5-10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-6.htm" title="And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.">2Chronicles 14:6</a>) was naturally the traditional policy of the kingdom of Judah--small in extent, menaced by more powerful neighbours, but having an exceedingly strong country and central position.<span class= "bld"><p>Diseased in his feet.</span>--In the Chronicles it is added significantly, "in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians" (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/16-7.htm" title="And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.">2Chronicles 16:7-12</a>); and from the same records it appears that in his last days Asa ventured to defy the prophetic authority by the imprisonment of Hanani the seer. Prosperity, it is implied, had somewhat deteriorated his character, though he still continued faithful to the worship of God.
