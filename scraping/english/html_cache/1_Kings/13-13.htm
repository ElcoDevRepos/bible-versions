The term "prophet" indicates a person who is considered a spokesperson for God, though in this context, the old prophet's actions are questionable. The mention of "his sons" suggests a family dynamic and possibly a school of prophets, which was common in ancient Israel. This setting in Bethel is significant, as Bethel was a center of idolatrous worship established by Jeroboam, contrasting with the true worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>&#8220;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8221;</b><br>The act of saddling a donkey indicates preparation for a journey. In ancient Near Eastern culture, donkeys were common means of transportation, especially for those who could not afford horses. This request shows the prophet's urgency and determination to pursue the man of God from Judah. The donkey, a humble animal, is often used in biblical narratives, symbolizing peace and service, contrasting with the horse, which symbolizes war.<p><b>Then they saddled the donkey for him,</b><br>The sons' obedience in saddling the donkey reflects the cultural norm of respecting and following the instructions of one's father or elder. This action sets the stage for the ensuing encounter between the old prophet and the man of God. The preparation of the donkey signifies readiness and the beginning of a significant event, as the old prophet seeks to confront the man of God.<p><b>and he mounted it.</b><br>The act of mounting the donkey signifies the prophet's commitment to his mission. In biblical narratives, mounting an animal often precedes a significant journey or event. This action parallels other biblical figures who undertake journeys with divine or prophetic purposes, such as Balaam in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>. The journey of the old prophet foreshadows the unfolding of God's plan and the consequences of disobedience, highlighting themes of divine sovereignty and human responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An unnamed prophet living in Bethel who plays a significant role in the account by deceiving the man of God from Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_old_prophet.htm">The Sons of the Old Prophet</a></b><br>They inform their father about the man of God and later assist him by saddling the donkey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god_from_judah.htm">The Man of God from Judah</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar that King Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where King Jeroboam established a center of idol worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_donkey.htm">The Donkey</a></b><br>A means of transportation that the old prophet uses to pursue the man of God, symbolizing the urgency and determination in his actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>The account highlights the importance of discernment and obedience to God's word, even when faced with seemingly credible sources of authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The man of God's failure to adhere strictly to God's command serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_deception_in_spiritual_warfare.htm">The Role of Deception in Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The old prophet's deception illustrates how spiritual warfare can involve misleading influences, requiring believers to be vigilant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Faithfulness to God's instructions is paramount, even when it contradicts human logic or societal norms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_our_actions.htm">The Impact of Our Actions</a></b><br>The account reminds us that our actions, whether obedient or disobedient, have lasting impacts beyond our immediate circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_saddle_donkey_in_1_Kings_13_13.htm">Why did the old prophet saddle his donkey in 1 Kings 13:13?

By calling on them, he accepts responsibility to act.<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays a father giving instructions to sons as a moment of imparting responsibility (<a href="/genesis/22-7.htm">Genesis 22:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This opening phrase signals that what follows is purposeful, not casual; it sets up a deliberate response to the divine sign the sons described (<a href="/1_kings/13-5.htm">1 Kings 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saddle the donkey for me</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Saddle the donkey for me.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The urgency of saddling a donkey indicates haste to meet the man of God before he travels farther (compare <a href="/2_kings/4-24.htm">2 Kings 4:24</a>, where Elisha&#8217;s servant is told to &#8220;run&#8221; without delay).<p>&#8226; A donkey was the common means of transport for prophets and judges (<a href="/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>). The old prophet&#8217;s request reflects normal prophetic travel, underscoring the literal historical setting.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows determination to seek clarification or confrontation after hearing of God&#8217;s direct intervention at Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; His action echoes earlier patterns where a servant of God moves quickly after receiving news&#8212;Abraham saddling his donkey in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, or Balaam in <a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>&#8212;inviting us to consider the motives that drive such speed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they saddled the donkey for him</b><p>&#8220;Then they saddled the donkey for him&#8221;<p>&#8226; The sons&#8217; obedience highlights family cooperation, paralleling the readiness of Elisha&#8217;s servant Gehazi (<a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Their compliance lends credibility to the report they gave; they also facilitate their father&#8217;s next steps, showing how God often uses ordinary obedience to advance His larger plans (<a href="/1_samuel/17-20.htm">1 Samuel 17:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds readers that prophetic narratives are grounded in concrete actions&#8212;real animals, real travel&#8212;underscoring the trustworthiness of the account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he mounted it</b><p>&#8220;and he mounted it&#8221;<p>&#8226; The old prophet personally mounts the donkey, committing himself to the journey. His physical movement signals intention to engage the younger prophet directly.<p>&#8226; This mirrors the resolve of characters like Abigail, who &#8220;rode her donkey&#8221; to intercept David (<a href="/1_samuel/25-20.htm">1 Samuel 25:20</a>), demonstrating that decisive action can influence unfolding events.<p>&#8226; In context, his mounting initiates a chain that leads to testing the younger prophet&#8217;s obedience (<a href="/1_kings/13-14.htm">1 Kings 13:14&#8211;19</a>). The verse therefore marks a hinge between hearing about God&#8217;s work and acting in response.<p>&#8226; The scene anticipates <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;There is a way that seems right to a man&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;inviting reflection on motives that will soon be revealed as mixed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-13.htm">1 Kings 13:13</a> captures a pivotal moment where the old prophet, stirred by eyewitness testimony, moves swiftly to engage God&#8217;s messenger. Each phrase highlights deliberate action: issuing a command, providing transportation, ensuring obedience, and personally setting out. The verse emphasizes responsibility within the family, the practicality of prophetic ministry, and the seriousness with which God&#8217;s recent intervention is treated. Together these details prepare us for the forthcoming test of discernment and obedience that will unfold in the rest of the chapter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass.</span> [This prompt and seemingly abrupt command - though we cannot be sure that all the conversation is here reported - shows his instant resolve to follow.
