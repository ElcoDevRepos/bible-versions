This detail highlights the craftsmanship and durability of the structure. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such measurements were common for large bronze works, indicating both strength and the skill of the artisans. The use of bronze, a durable and valuable material, reflects the wealth and resources available during Solomon's reign.<p><b>and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom</b><br>The design of the rim, resembling a cup or a lily blossom, suggests an aesthetic quality that was both functional and symbolic. The lily is often associated with beauty and purity in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/songs/2.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1-2</a>. This imagery may symbolize the purity and holiness required in the temple, as well as the beauty of God's creation. The cup-like shape could also imply abundance and blessing, as cups are often used to hold and pour out liquid, symbolizing the outpouring of God's blessings.<p><b>It could hold two thousand baths</b><br>The capacity of the basin, holding two thousand baths, indicates its immense size and function. A bath is an ancient unit of measurement, roughly equivalent to 5.8 gallons or 22 liters. This large capacity was necessary for the ritual purification processes in the temple, as water was essential for cleansing and ceremonial washing. The vast amount of water also symbolizes the abundance of God's provision and the cleansing power of His presence. This can be connected to the New Testament, where water is a symbol of spiritual cleansing and renewal, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and its furnishings, including the Sea described in this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, built by Solomon as a permanent dwelling for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>A large basin made of cast metal, used for ceremonial washing by the priests in the temple.

This detail underlines the literal solidity of the bronze Sea&#8212;no flimsy ornament, but a hefty vessel meant to endure (cf. <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; The thickness signals permanence. God&#8217;s provisions for worship were built to last, mirroring His unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests relied on this basin for ritual cleansing before serving (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>). A sturdy laver highlighted that holy service requires continual, reliable cleansing (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its rim was fashioned like the brim of a cup</b><p>&#8226; The rim curved outward &#8220;like the brim of a cup,&#8221; inviting the eye and, symbolically, inviting worshipers to think of receiving from God.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses the image of a cup to speak of blessing poured out (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/116-13.htm">Psalm 116:13</a>). The Sea&#8217;s cup-like edge hints at God&#8217;s readiness to fill His people with grace as they approach Him.<p>&#8226; Practically, the design kept water from spilling, preserving what was sacred for priestly washing&#8212;just as believers are called to guard their hearts (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a lily blossom</b><p>&#8226; Lilies in Scripture evoke purity and beauty (Song of Songs 2:1-2; <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>; <a href="/luke/12-27.htm">Luke 12:27</a>). The floral rim signaled that cleansing leads to moral beauty&#8212;&#8220;adorned&#8221; lives (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The Temple was not merely functional; it pointed to the splendor of God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>). Every detail, even a sculpted lily, preached that holiness is beautiful (<a href="/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The combination of strength (thick bronze) and elegance (lily motif) shows that God&#8217;s truth and beauty are never at odds (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It could hold two thousand baths</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;bath&#8221; was about 5&#8211;6 gallons (20&#8211;25 liters). Two thousand baths equal roughly 10&#8211;12,000 gallons (40-45,000 liters). The sheer size stresses God&#8217;s abundant provision for cleansing (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-5.htm">2 Chronicles 4:5</a> notes the Sea &#8220;held three thousand baths,&#8221; describing maximum capacity, while 1 Kings cites the regular working amount. Both statements are accurate, simply viewing the same vessel from different angles.<p>&#8226; The vast water supply foreshadowed the even greater spiritual washing available through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). Where sin abounds, grace abounds much more (<a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The single verse paints a vivid, literal picture: a massive, four-inch-thick bronze basin, elegantly rimmed like a cup and adorned with lily motifs, holding thousands of gallons for priestly cleansing. Its strength displays God&#8217;s permanence, its cup-shape speaks of blessing offered, its lily design proclaims purity&#8217;s beauty, and its vast capacity points to the super-abundant cleansing God provides for all who draw near to Him through faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was a handbreadth thick</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, three inches], <span class="cmt_word">and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and his lip like the work of the lip of a cup, i.e.</span>, curved outwards], <span class="cmt_word">with flowers of lilies</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">blossom of lily."</span> Keil understands "ornamented with lily flowers," but the strict interpretation the "lily blossom" being in apposition to "cup" - requires us to refer the words to the shape rather than to the ornamentation of the laver. The lip was curved like a lily]: i<span class="cmt_word">t contained two thousand</span> [In Chronicles and by Josephus the number is given as 3000. This may have resulted, as Keil thinks, from confounding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> but it is suspicious that so many of the numbers of the Chronicles are exaggerations. The common explanation of the discrepancy, viz., that it held 2000 baths "when filled to its ordinary height, but when filled to the brim 3000" (Wordsworth), appears to me hardly ingenuous] baths. ["The data for determining the value of the bath or ephah are both scanty and conflicting" (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1741). Josephus, the only authority on the subject, says that it equalled the Attic <span class="accented">metretes</span> (about 8.5 gals.), but it is very doubtful whether he was "really familiar with the Greek measures" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) At any rate, if this statement is correct, his other statement as to the shape of the laver must be altogether erroneous, since 2000 baths would equal 17,000 gals., and a hemispherical laver could not possibly have contained more than 10,000. The attempt has been made, on the assumption that the sea was a hemisphere, as Josephus affirms, to calculate from its capacity the value of the bath, which in that case would be about four gallons. But there is good reason for doubting whether the laver was hemispherical - such a shape would be ill adapted to its position on the backs of oxen - and some have maintained that <span class="cmt_word">it</span> was cylindrical, others that, like the laver of the tabernacle, it had a foot (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>) or basin. The prevailing opinion of scholars, however, appears to be that it was 30 cubits in circumference only at the lip, and that it bellied out considerably below. While the shape, however, must remain a matter of uncertainty, we are left in no doubt as to its purpose. It was "for the priests to wash in" (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>) - not, of course, for immersing their whole persons, but their hands and feet (<a href="/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19, 21</a>). The priests (after <a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>, etc.) ministered barefoot. It was, according to Rabbinical tradition, provided with taps or faucets (Bahr). It has, however, been held by some that the water issued forth (as in the Alhambra) from the lions' mouths. It is probable that a basin of some sort was attached to it. Whether the laver was filled by the hand or by some special contrivance, it is quite impossible to say. We know that provision was made for storing water hard by. The present writer was privileged in 1861 to explore the great reservoir, the <span class="accented">Bahr el Khebir</span>, still existing underneath the Haram area, at a time when very few Europeans had seen it (see Pal. Explor. Fund, No. 7; Barclay, "City of the Great King;" Porter, Handbook, 1. pp. 134, 138).
