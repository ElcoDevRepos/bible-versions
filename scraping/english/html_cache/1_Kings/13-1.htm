Jeroboam established alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan to prevent his subjects from traveling to Jerusalem in Judah, which was under the rule of Rehoboam. The act of burning incense was typically reserved for priests, and Jeroboam's participation in this ritual indicates his usurpation of religious authority, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-9</a>). This act of idolatry and false worship is a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel</b><br>The "man of God" is an unnamed prophet sent by God from Judah, the southern kingdom, to confront Jeroboam. This highlights the division between the two kingdoms and underscores the faithfulness of Judah in maintaining the true worship of Yahweh. Bethel, meaning "house of God," was a significant religious site, but under Jeroboam, it became a center of idolatry. The presence of a prophet from Judah emphasizes the continuity of God's message and authority despite the political division.<p><b>by the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates that the prophet's mission was divinely ordained. The "word of the LORD" signifies the authority and power behind the prophet's message, emphasizing that it is not of human origin but a direct command from God. This underscores the prophetic tradition in Israel, where prophets served as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's word being active and effective (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>), and it foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's word in Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Iddo, however, notwithstanding his "visions against Jeroboam the son of Nebat" (<a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), it cannot have been, for he survived to the reign of Abijah, and indeed wrote a "story" (Heb. <span class="accented">Midrash, i.e.</span>, Commentary) of that reign, whereas this man of God died forthwith.
