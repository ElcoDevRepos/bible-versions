The act of banishment suggests a commitment to purifying the land from practices deemed unholy or contrary to the worship of Yahweh. In the context of ancient Israel, the land was considered holy, and its purity was essential for maintaining a covenant relationship with God. This action reflects the king's desire to align the nation more closely with the laws given in the Torah, particularly those found in Deuteronomy, which emphasize the need to remove idolatry and its associated practices from the land.<p><b>the male shrine prostitutes</b><br>The term refers to individuals involved in ritualistic sexual practices associated with pagan worship, particularly in Canaanite religions. These practices were often linked to fertility rites and were considered abominations in the eyes of the God of Israel. The presence of male shrine prostitutes indicates the influence of surrounding pagan cultures on Israel. The Torah explicitly condemns such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17-18</a>), and their removal was necessary to restore proper worship. This action can be seen as part of a broader reform movement to eliminate idolatry and syncretism from Israelite society.<p><b>who remained from the days of his father Asa</b><br>This phrase provides historical context, indicating that these practices had persisted despite previous reforms. King Asa, the father of the current king, had also undertaken religious reforms, as recorded earlier in <a href="/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12</a>, where he removed male shrine prostitutes and idols. However, the persistence of these practices suggests that Asa's reforms were incomplete or that they had reemerged over time. The continuation of these practices highlights the ongoing struggle within Israel to maintain religious purity and the challenges faced by successive kings in eradicating deeply entrenched pagan customs. This context underscores the cyclical nature of reform and apostasy in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who continued the religious reforms initiated by his father, Asa.
