It sets the stage for a new episode in the ongoing saga of Ahab's reign. The timing suggests a period of relative peace or normalcy following the dramatic confrontation on Mount Carmel, highlighting the ongoing tension between Ahab's rule and the prophetic voice of Elijah.<p><b>Naboth the Jezreelite</b><br>Naboth is introduced as a resident of Jezreel, a city with significant historical and strategic importance in Israel. The mention of his name and origin emphasizes his identity and connection to the land, which is crucial in understanding the cultural and legal implications of the story. Naboth's vineyard represents more than just property; it is an inheritance tied to his family's lineage and God's covenant with Israel regarding land ownership (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>).<p><b>owned a vineyard in Jezreel</b><br>The vineyard's location in Jezreel is significant due to the city's role as a royal and military center. Vineyards were valuable assets in ancient Israel, symbolizing prosperity and blessing. The ownership of such a vineyard by Naboth underscores his status as a respected and established member of the community. The land's inheritance laws, rooted in the Mosaic covenant, prohibited the permanent sale of family land, highlighting the tension between Naboth's rights and Ahab's desires.<p><b>next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria</b><br>The proximity of Naboth's vineyard to Ahab's palace in Jezreel sets up the conflict. Ahab's palace in Jezreel served as a secondary residence, indicating his interest in expanding his influence and control. The mention of Ahab as "king of Samaria" underscores his authority and the political dynamics at play. This phrase foreshadows the impending clash between royal power and individual rights, reflecting broader themes of justice and righteousness in the biblical narrative. The story of Naboth's vineyard becomes a microcosm of the struggle between godly obedience and corrupt leadership, with implications for understanding the nature of true kingship as ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the righteous King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naboth_the_jezreelite.htm">Naboth the Jezreelite</a></b><br>Naboth is a resident of Jezreel, known for owning a vineyard that becomes the focal point of a significant biblical account involving King Ahab.

He is known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into further sin.

Yet, instead of gratitude, Ahab&#8217;s heart remains unchanged.<p>&#8226; Scripture often places a moral test &#8220;after these events.&#8221; Compare <a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a> (&#8220;In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war&#8230;&#8221;)&#8212;right before David&#8217;s fall.

The plot&#8217;s closeness to Ahab&#8217;s palace spotlights the temptation of power. The verse quietly introduces every theme that follows: the sanctity of inheritance, the abuse of authority, and God&#8217;s righteous response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Which was in Jezreel.</span>--The LXX. omits these words, and makes the vineyard to be "hard by the threshing-floor of Ahab, king of Samaria"--the word being the same as that rendered "void place" in <a href="/1_kings/22-10.htm" title="And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.">1Kings 22:10</a>--apparently near the palace of Ahab in Samaria, not in Jezreel. The Vulgate renders "who was" instead of "which was" in Jezreel. The question of the position of the vineyard, apparently the scene of Naboth's murder, is difficult. The "plot of ground" of <a href="/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25-26</a>--not, however, called "a vineyard"--is clearly at Jezreel. where, as a native of the place, Naboth would be likely to hold land. But the vineyard may have been an outlying property near Samaria, which Ahab might naturally suppose Naboth, even for that re<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm" title="And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.">1Kings 21:19</a>, which in <a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm" title="And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.">1Kings 22:38</a> is declared to have been fulfilled at the pool of Samaria. Moreover, the whole action of the chapter, as far as Ahab is concerned, seems to have been at Samaria; and, indeed, if we take <a href="/1_kings/21-18.htm" title="Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.">1Kings 21:18</a> literally, this is actually declared to be the case. On the other side, however, we have the reading of the text, the more obvious interpretation of the words "his city" in <a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm" title="So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.">1Kings 21:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-11.htm" title="And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.">1Kings 21:11</a>; and the reference to the prophecy of Elijah, in connection with the casting of the body of Jehoram into the plot of ground at Jezreel (<a href="/context/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25-26</a>).
