His reign is marked by idolatry and moral decline, as he led Israel further away from the worship of Yahweh. The phrase emphasizes the uniqueness of Ahab's evil, suggesting that his actions were unprecedented among the kings of Israel. This sets a stark contrast with the ideal kingship exemplified by David, who was "a man after God's own heart" (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><b>who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The imagery of "selling oneself" implies a deliberate and willing choice to engage in sin, akin to a transaction where Ahab exchanged his integrity for wickedness. This phrase highlights the gravity of Ahab's actions, as he consciously chose to act against God's commandments. The concept of doing evil "in the sight of the LORD" underscores the omnipresence and omniscience of God, who sees all actions and judges them accordingly. This echoes the warnings given to Israel about the consequences of turning away from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>).<p><b>incited by his wife Jezebel</b><br>Jezebel, a Phoenician princess and Ahab's wife, played a significant role in leading Ahab and Israel into idolatry. Her influence is seen in the promotion of Baal worship and the persecution of Yahweh's prophets. Jezebel's actions fulfilled the warnings about foreign influences leading Israel astray (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). Her character is often associated with manipulation and seduction, drawing parallels to the "Jezebel" mentioned in <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>, who leads believers into immorality and idolatry. Jezebel's incitement of Ahab serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ungodly alliances and the impact of a spouse's influence on one's spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The seventh king of Israel, known for his idolatry and wickedness.

Earlier we were told, &#8220;Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30</a>). That record-setting evil is now underscored after the episode of Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Other kings sinned, but none matched the combination of power, opportunity, and persistent rebellion that marked Ahab&#8217;s reign (compare <a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a> concerning Jeroboam; <a href="/2_kings/21-11.htm">2 Kings 21:11</a> concerning Manasseh).<p>&#8226; The wording reminds us that God keeps an exact account of every life (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Ahab&#8217;s legacy is measured not by earthly success but by God&#8217;s moral ledger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who sold himself to do evil</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;who sold himself to do evil&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>b)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Sold himself&#8221; pictures a willing transaction: Ahab placed his heart, reputation, and authority on the auction block of wickedness. He was not tricked; he signed the bill of sale.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere uses the same imagery for those who choose sin as a master (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>). Ahab&#8217;s choice parallels Esau selling his birthright (<a href="/genesis/25-33.htm">Genesis 25:33</a>)&#8212;a conscious exchange of priceless treasure for temporary gain.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: every compromise carries a price tag. Small concessions harden into patterns, and patterns into slavery (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>; <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>). Ahab teaches us that sin is never a neutral transaction; it always demands ownership papers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the sight of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the sight of the LORD&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>c)<p>&#8226; The phrase anchors the verdict in divine, not human, perspective. Courts, advisers, and subjects may applaud or ignore a ruler&#8217;s conduct, but &#8220;the eyes of the LORD are in every place, observing the wicked and the good&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Elijah warned Ahab, &#8220;Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). God&#8217;s accusation rested on firsthand evidence.<p>&#8226; Comfort for the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14</a>) and warning for evildoers (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>) flow from this truth.

Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful; I will give you Naboth&#8217;s vineyard&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7</a>).

The verse does not absolve him; it explains the accelerant. Like Adam blaming Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>), excuses crumble before a holy God (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a> warns the New Testament church about a figurative &#8220;Jezebel,&#8221; showing that the spirit of seductive, manipulative evil did not die with the queen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a> paints a stark portrait of deliberate, record-breaking rebellion. Ahab uniquely chose to traffic his very soul in wickedness, living every moment under God&#8217;s watchful eye while fueled by Jezebel&#8217;s toxic counsel. The verse urges us to guard our hearts, weigh the cost of compromise, remember that God sees all, and choose influences that draw us toward, not away from, faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">The dogs shall eat Jezebel.</span>--In all his address to Ahab, Elijah has, as yet, disdained to name the instigator, on whom the coward king, no doubt, threw his guilt. Ahab stands revealed as the true culprit before God, without a shred of subterfuge to veil his ultimate responsibility. Now, briefly and sternly, the prophet notices the bolder criminal, pronouncing against her a doom of shame and horror, seldom falling upon a woman, but rightly visiting one who had forsworn the pity and modesty of her sex. In the "ditch" (see margin) outside the walls, where the refuse of the city gathers the half-wild dogs--the scavengers of Eastern cities--her dead body is to be thrown as offal, and to be torn and devoured.<p>This verse and the next are evidently the reflection of the compiler, catching its inspiration from the words of Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm" title="And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.">1Kings 21:20</a>.
