The act of sacrificing animals was a common practice in ancient Israel, symbolizing dedication and seeking favor from God. The abundance of sacrifices suggests an attempt to legitimize Adonijah's claim to the throne, as such offerings were often used to gain public support and divine approval. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where sacrifices are used to mark significant transitions or covenants, such as Solomon's later dedication of the temple (1 Kings 8).<p><b>and has invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest</b><br>Adonijah's invitation list is strategic, aiming to gather influential support for his claim to kingship. The "sons of the king" refers to David's other sons, who could be potential rivals or allies. By including them, Adonijah seeks to consolidate his power and prevent opposition. The "commanders of the army" are crucial for military backing, reflecting the importance of securing the loyalty of the armed forces in ancient Near Eastern politics. Abiathar the priest's presence is significant, as he was a high-ranking religious leader, and his support would lend religious legitimacy to Adonijah's claim. This mirrors the political maneuvering seen in other biblical narratives, such as Absalom's rebellion (2 Samuel 15).<p><b>And behold, they are eating and drinking before him</b><br>The act of eating and drinking together signifies a covenant or agreement, often used to seal alliances in the ancient world. This communal meal indicates acceptance and celebration of Adonijah's self-proclaimed kingship. In biblical culture, shared meals were significant social and religious events, symbolizing unity and fellowship. This scene contrasts with the Last Supper in the New Testament, where Jesus shares a meal with His disciples, symbolizing a new covenant and foreshadowing His sacrificial death.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Long live King Adonijah!&#8217;</b><br>The acclamation "Long live King Adonijah!" is a public declaration of support and recognition of his claim to the throne. This phrase is a traditional expression of loyalty and allegiance to a new ruler. However, the context reveals the premature nature of this proclamation, as David had not yet declared his successor. This highlights the tension and conflict within the royal family and the kingdom. The phrase also foreshadows the eventual failure of Adonijah's bid for kingship, as God's plan for Solomon to succeed David is ultimately fulfilled, reflecting the biblical theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempts to declare himself king without David's blessing.
