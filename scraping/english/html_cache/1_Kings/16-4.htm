Baasha's reign was marked by idolatry and sin, similar to the kings before him. The city, in ancient Israelite context, was a place of supposed safety and civilization. However, the prophecy reveals that even within the city walls, there will be no refuge from God's judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme that no earthly power or location can shield one from divine retribution (see <a href="/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>).<p><b>will be eaten by dogs</b><br>Dogs in ancient Near Eastern culture were often seen as scavengers and unclean animals. The imagery of dogs consuming the dead is a sign of disgrace and dishonor, as proper burial was a significant cultural and religious practice in Israel. This prophecy echoes the fate of Jezebel, as foretold in <a href="/2_kings/9-10.htm">2 Kings 9:10</a>, where dogs would eat her flesh. It symbolizes the complete and utter rejection of Baasha's lineage by God.<p><b>and anyone who dies in the field</b><br>The field represents the open and unprotected areas outside the city. Those who die in the field are exposed and vulnerable, lacking the protection that city walls might offer. This part of the prophecy emphasizes that God's judgment will reach every corner, both urban and rural, leaving no place for escape.<p><b>will be eaten by the birds of the air.</b><br>Birds of prey consuming the dead is another image of disgrace and divine judgment. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, such a fate is listed among the curses for disobedience to God's covenant. This imagery is used to convey the totality of God's judgment, as the dead are left unburied and exposed to scavengers. It underscores the severity of the consequences for Baasha's sins and the complete eradication of his house, similar to the judgment pronounced on Jeroboam's house in <a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>Baasha was the king of Israel who reigned after overthrowing Nadab, the son of Jeroboam.

To be devoured by dogs was the ultimate sign of shame (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>; 21:24).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s curse ensures that Baasha&#8217;s household will experience dishonor even after death, showing that divine justice extends beyond the grave.<p>&#8226; The detail is literal yet carries a sobering moral truth: persistent sin ends in humiliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and anyone who dies in the field</b><p>&#8226; The field represents the countryside, far from urban defenses.<p>&#8226; Whether Baasha&#8217;s followers fall in battle or die naturally while working the land, they cannot escape God&#8217;s sentence.<p>&#8226; The language closes every loophole: judgment reaches city streets and open country alike (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/7-32.htm">Jeremiah 7:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be eaten by the birds of the air</b><p>&#8226; Birds&#8212;vultures, carrion eaters&#8212;finish what the dogs do not. Public exposure of corpses was a covenant curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The image highlights irreversible ruin: no burial rites, no legacy, only a spectacle of God&#8217;s wrath (cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35&#8211;37</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; It mirrors prophetic warnings against nations that defy God, showing that Israel itself is not exempt when her leaders embrace idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/16-4.htm">1 Kings 16:4</a> delivers a comprehensive, literal judgment on Baasha&#8217;s household: every follower, in every location, will meet a shameful end, with dogs and birds ensuring no honorable burial. The verse reaffirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant warnings, displaying both His sovereignty over nations and His intolerance of persistent idolatry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that dieth of</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span>; see note on 1 Kings 14:11] <span class="cmt_word">Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat</span>.
