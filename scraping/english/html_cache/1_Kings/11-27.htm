Jeroboam, an Ephraimite, was a servant of Solomon who rose to prominence due to his industrious nature. The rebellion is significant as it marks the beginning of the division of the united monarchy of Israel. This event fulfills the prophecy given by the prophet Ahijah, who foretold the division of the kingdom due to Solomon's idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>). The rebellion is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, leading to the establishment of the northern kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam.<p><b>Solomon had built the supporting terraces</b><br>The supporting terraces, also known as the Millo, were part of Solomon's extensive building projects in Jerusalem. These terraces were likely a series of earthworks or retaining walls that supported the expansion of the city. Archaeological evidence suggests that such structures were crucial for the development of ancient cities, providing stability and additional space for construction. Solomon's building projects, including the Temple and his palace, were grand and required significant resources and labor, which contributed to the discontent among the people and set the stage for Jeroboam's rebellion.<p><b>and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.</b><br>The repair of the gap in the wall indicates Solomon's efforts to fortify Jerusalem, enhancing its defenses and infrastructure. The city of David refers to the original settlement of Jerusalem, which David captured and established as his capital. Strengthening the city's fortifications was essential for maintaining security and asserting royal authority. This action reflects Solomon's administrative and military priorities but also highlights the burdens placed on the population, as such projects demanded heavy taxation and labor. The mention of David connects Solomon's reign to his father's legacy, emphasizing the continuity of the Davidic dynasty, which holds messianic significance in biblical prophecy, pointing to the future reign of Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the temple in Jerusalem.

Daily witnessing the burden on his own tribesmen from Ephraim and Manasseh likely fueled his discontent.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s dazzling achievements&#8212;palace, temple, terraces&#8212;came at the cost of fracturing unity. Just as the Tower builders in <a href="/bsb/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a> sought greatness apart from God&#8217;s priorities, Solomon&#8217;s grand scale hinted that his heart was drifting (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David</b><p>&#8220; &#8230; and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>c)<p>&#8226; Strengthening Jerusalem&#8217;s fortifications was prudent after past conflicts (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-26</a>). Yet it also signaled increasing centralization of power.<p>&#8226; A &#8220;gap&#8221; implies vulnerability; Solomon&#8217;s repair closed that breach&#8212;good for security, but also symbolic of closing ranks around the southern tribe of Judah.<p>&#8226; Jeroboam, overseeing this construction, witnessed a king fortifying the capital even as the outer tribes bore the brunt of the labor. That contrast sharpened the north-south tension eventually seen in <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>.<p>&#8226; Later kings like Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) would repair walls in faith. Solomon&#8217;s repairs, however, stand beside his accumulation of wives and idols (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>), underscoring that building projects alone cannot substitute for covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> explains why Jeroboam rose against Solomon: the king&#8217;s grand construction&#8212;supporting terraces and wall repairs&#8212;required oppressive labor, confirming Samuel&#8217;s earlier warnings. While the works strengthened Jerusalem, they exposed Solomon&#8217;s drift from servant-leadership to self-exalting monarchy.
