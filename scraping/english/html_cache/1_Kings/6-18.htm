Cedar was highly valued in the ancient Near East for its durability, resistance to decay, and pleasant aroma. It was imported from Lebanon, indicating the wealth and resources available to Solomon. The use of cedar also reflects the grandeur and majesty of the temple, as it was a material often used in royal and sacred buildings. This choice of material underscores the temple's purpose as a dwelling place for God, emphasizing its sanctity and the reverence due to it.<p><b>was carved with gourds and open flowers.</b><br>The carvings of gourds and open flowers are rich in symbolism. Gourds, often associated with sustenance and provision, may symbolize God's provision for His people. Open flowers can represent beauty, life, and the flourishing of creation under God's care. These carvings reflect the artistry and craftsmanship involved in the temple's construction, highlighting the importance of beauty and detail in worship spaces. The imagery also connects to the Garden of Eden, suggesting a return to paradise and communion with God.<p><b>Everything was cedar;</b><br>The complete use of cedar for the interior signifies purity and uniformity. It creates a seamless and harmonious environment, free from the distractions of varied materials. This uniformity can symbolize the unity and consistency of God's presence and His unchanging nature. The exclusivity of cedar in the temple's interior also points to the idea of holiness, setting the temple apart from ordinary structures.<p><b>not a stone could be seen.</b><br>The covering of stone with cedar paneling indicates a transformation from the ordinary to the extraordinary. While stone represents strength and permanence, the cedar overlay adds an element of beauty and refinement. This transformation can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual transformation that occurs in the presence of God. The hidden stones also suggest the idea of inner beauty and the importance of what is unseen, aligning with biblical themes of inner purity and the heart's condition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.

By lining the sanctuary with it, Solomon ensured the interior would remain beautiful and fragrant for generations, echoing the Lord&#8217;s promise of lasting presence (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Cedar&#8217;s rich scent and warm color created a welcoming place of worship, reminding Israel that God desires fellowship, not a cold, stone enclosure (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Covering the walls with wood rather than leaving bare masonry symbolized redemption: the rough stone of human effort hidden beneath the richness God provides (<a href="/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carved with Gourds and Open Flowers</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;was carved with gourds and open flowers.&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Gourds and blossoms portray life, growth, and fruitfulness&#8212;images first seen in Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8-9</a>). By decorating the walls this way, Solomon recalled God&#8217;s original design for humanity: living in fruitful fellowship with Him.<p>&#8226; The open flower motif suggests continual praise and responsiveness to God, like the lampstand in the tabernacle with its almond-blossom cups (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-34</a>).<p>&#8226; These carvings were not mere ornamentation; they proclaimed that true worship leads to flourishing (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything Was Cedar; Not a Stone Could Be Seen</b><p>&#8220;Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen.&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-18.htm">1 Kings 6:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Total coverage emphasizes completeness.
