The portico, or porch, was part of Solomon's Temple, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The use of pillars in temple architecture is reminiscent of the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which stood at the entrance of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). These pillars symbolize strength and stability, reflecting God's enduring covenant with Israel.<p><b>were shaped like lilies</b><br>Lilies are often associated with beauty and purity in biblical literature. The lily motif in the temple's design may symbolize the beauty and holiness of God. In the Song of Solomon, lilies are used to describe the beloved (<a href="/songs/2.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1-2</a>), and Jesus later references lilies in His teachings about God's provision (<a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-29</a>). The use of floral designs in the temple underscores the connection between creation and the Creator, highlighting the divine artistry in both nature and sacred spaces.<p><b>four cubits high</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, the capitals were about six feet high, indicating their prominence and grandeur. The specific measurement emphasizes the importance of precision and order in the construction of the temple, reflecting God's desire for excellence in worship. The height of the capitals also suggests their visibility and significance, drawing attention to the entrance of the temple and inviting worshippers to enter into God's presence with reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace, including the detailed work described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman from Tyre, often associated with the construction of Solomon's temple and palace, including the intricate designs of the pillars.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem built by Solomon as a dwelling place for the Lord, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_portico.htm">The Portico</a></b><br>An architectural feature of Solomon's temple, serving as an entrance or porch area, where the pillars with lily-shaped capitals were located.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pillars.htm">The Pillars</a></b><br>Two significant bronze pillars named Jachin and Boaz, which stood at the entrance of the temple, symbolizing strength and stability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_beauty_in_worship.htm">Symbolism of Beauty in Worship</a></b><br>The lily-shaped capitals remind us of the importance of beauty and artistry in worship spaces, reflecting God's own creativity and attention to detail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_and_stability.htm">God's Presence and Stability</a></b><br>The pillars, with their ornate capitals, symbolize the strength and stability of God's presence in our lives, encouraging us to rely on Him as our foundation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_service.htm">Attention to Detail in Service</a></b><br>Just as the temple's construction involved meticulous craftsmanship, our service to God should be marked by diligence and excellence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_god's_design.htm">Continuity of God's Design</a></b><br>The design elements in the temple connect to earlier worship structures, showing God's consistent plan and purpose throughout biblical history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_growth_and_flourishing.htm">Spiritual Growth and Flourishing</a></b><br>The lily, often a symbol of growth and beauty, can inspire us to pursue spiritual growth and flourishing in our walk with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_7_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 7:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_7_19_God_s_detail_in_creation.htm">How does 1 Kings 7:19 reflect God's attention to detail in creation?

Exactly where the eye is drawn&#8212;upward. Every worshiper entering the temple courts first saw these towering columns with their ornate heads (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>).<p>- The upward focus parallels <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, directing hearts to &#8220;lift up my eyes to the hills&#8212;where does my help come from?&#8221;<p>- In practical terms, capitals also stabilized the pillars, just as Christ &#8220;holds all things together&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the portico</b><p>- The portico (or porch) was the threshold between the outer court and the Holy Place (<a href="/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>).<p>- Here, God welcomed His people to move from common ground to consecrated space&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>: &#8220;Enter His gates with thanksgiving.&#8221;<p>- The columns framed that invitation, urging Israel to step from everyday life into covenant fellowship (<a href="/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48&#8211;49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaped like lilies</b><p>- The lily motif speaks of purity, grace, and resurrection life.

Probably the bowl-shaped chapiter was treated as a fullblown lily, just as the capitals of Egyptian pillars took the form of the lotus. The molten sea was similarly treated (ver. 26). The lily (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), <span class="accented">to be white</span>), was undoubtedly an emblem of purity. Bahr observes that it may justly be named "the flower of the promised land," and that as the lotus was the religious flower of the Indian and Egyptian religions, so was the lily of the Jewish] <span class="cmt_word">in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the porch</span> [These words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, are very obscure. Keil understands" as in the hall" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, LXX.) But that idea would have been expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and nothing is said elsewhere about any lily work in the porch (Bahr). Ewald, too, thinks the decoration of the porch is referred to, and holds that a description of this lily work must once have preceded this statement, though it is now wanting. Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>. suppose them to refer to the position of the pillars within the porch, and the "four cubits" mentioned presently, they take to indicate the diameter of the capitals. Wordsworth would render "inside or <span class="accented">toward</span> the porch," and understands that the lily work was only on the <span class="accented">inside</span> of the pillars. It is, perhaps, impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion], <span class="cmt_word">four cubits</span>. [This may either mean that of five cubits (which was the height of the entire capital), four, and these the upper four (ver. 22), were covered with lily work, while one cubit at the bottom of the capital was ornamented with chain-work or festeons - we can hardly believe that nets, chains, and lily work were all combined in the same space, or it may refer to the position of the pillars in the portico.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the capitals</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1431;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
