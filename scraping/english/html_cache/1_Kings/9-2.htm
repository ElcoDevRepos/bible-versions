The first appearance occurred in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>, where God offered Solomon anything he desired, and Solomon famously asked for wisdom. This second appearance underscores the importance of Solomon's reign and God's continued guidance. It also highlights the covenant relationship, where God actively engages with His chosen leaders. The repetition of divine appearances signifies God's faithfulness and the importance of Solomon's role in Israel's history.<p><b>as He had appeared to him at Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant location in Israel's history, known for its high place where Solomon offered sacrifices (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>). It was here that God first appeared to Solomon in a dream, granting him wisdom. The mention of Gibeon connects this second appearance to the initial divine encounter, reinforcing the continuity of God's promises and Solomon's responsibilities. Gibeon was also a Levitical city, adding a layer of religious significance. This connection to Gibeon serves as a reminder of God's consistent presence and the importance of seeking divine wisdom and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates directly with Solomon, affirming His ongoing relationship and covenant with the king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The King of Israel, son of David, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.

Solomon cannot hide behind the nation; God&#8217;s word confronts him personally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a second time</b><p>- This phrase recalls God&#8217;s faithfulness: what He begins, He continues (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>- It marks progression&#8212;Solomon has moved from youthful request (wisdom) to mature administration. God&#8217;s second appearance evaluates and directs the next season.<p>- The Bible records only two divine appearances to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>; 9:2), showing that special revelations are rare, weighty, and tied to pivotal moments.<p>- Repetition reinforces certainty (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>). By appearing again, God confirms that His earlier promises still stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as He had appeared</b><p>- The comparison links the two encounters: the same covenant God, consistent in character, meets Solomon in consistent manner (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p>- It signals continuity of message&#8212;God will expand, not contradict, what He has already spoken (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- Solomon can measure the present word against the former; Scripture models testing later experiences by earlier revelation (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to him at Gibeon</b><p>- Gibeon (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4-15</a>) was where Solomon sought God with a thousand burnt offerings and received the gift of wisdom.<p>- Remembering Gibeon recalls:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s unconditional promise of wisdom and honor.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s humble heart at the start of his reign.<p>&#8226; The joy of answered prayer that launched decades of prosperity.<p>- The contrast is intentional: the first appearance greeted a king in dependence; the second confronts a king with achievements&#8212;will he maintain the same devotion? (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>).<p>- Location may differ (the second occurs in Jerusalem), yet the reference to Gibeon roots Solomon&#8217;s present in his past, reminding him&#8212;and us&#8212;never to forget initial grace (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2</a> teaches that the God who personally revealed Himself to Solomon at the beginning of his reign graciously appeared again after the temple&#8217;s completion, reaffirming covenant, evaluating faithfulness, and calling Solomon to continued obedience. The verse lays groundwork for the message that follows (9:3-9): God&#8217;s promises are sure, His standards unchanging, and His relationship with His people personal and purposeful.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time</span> [see on 1 Kings 6:11, and <a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9</a>;
