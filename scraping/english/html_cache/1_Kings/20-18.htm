The context is a battle where King Ben-Hadad of Aram is strategizing against King Ahab of Israel. The mention of "peace" suggests a potential diplomatic approach or surrender, which was common in ancient Near Eastern warfare. The Arameans might have expected a peaceful delegation or a surrender, reflecting the complex nature of ancient warfare where battles could be resolved through negotiation or submission.<p><b>he said,</b><br>The speaker here is Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram. His command reflects his authority and the centralized power of monarchs in the ancient world. Kings often made strategic decisions in battle, and their words were law for their commanders and soldiers. This highlights the hierarchical structure of ancient armies and the absolute power wielded by kings.<p><b>take them alive.</b><br>The command to take captives alive rather than kill them indicates a strategic decision. Capturing enemies alive could serve multiple purposes: gaining intelligence, using them as hostages, or demonstrating power and mercy. This practice is seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as when David spared King Saul's life. It reflects a broader biblical theme of mercy and the potential for reconciliation.<p><b>Even if they have marched out for war,</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the possibility of an aggressive approach by the Israelites. The readiness for war contrasts with the earlier mention of peace, showing the unpredictability of human intentions. It also reflects the constant state of tension and conflict in the region, where alliances and enmities could shift rapidly. The dual possibility of peace or war underscores the need for vigilance and preparedness.<p><b>take them alive.</b><br>Reiterating the command emphasizes its importance. In biblical narratives, repetition often signifies emphasis or certainty. This insistence on capturing rather than killing could be seen as a strategic move to weaken Israel without unnecessary bloodshed. It also aligns with the biblical principle of valuing life, even in the context of conflict. This approach can be seen as a type of Christ, who came to save and redeem rather than destroy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who is besieging Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

By treating Israel&#8217;s approach&#8212;peaceful or armed&#8212;as equally inconsequential, he unwittingly sets himself against God&#8217;s declared plan.
