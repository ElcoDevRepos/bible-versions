Zadok, a descendant of Aaron, was a high priest, symbolizing the religious authority and continuity of the priesthood. Nathan, a prophet, represents the voice of God and divine approval. Their involvement underscores the legitimacy of Solomon's kingship, as both religious and prophetic endorsements were crucial in ancient Israel. This partnership between priest and prophet reflects the dual roles of spiritual leadership and divine guidance in Israel's governance.<p><b>have anointed him king at Gihon</b><br>Gihon was a significant water source near Jerusalem, often associated with life and blessing. Anointing at Gihon symbolizes the life-giving and sustaining power of God over the new king. Anointing with oil was a sacred act, signifying the setting apart of an individual for divine service. This act at Gihon connects Solomon's kingship with God's provision and blessing. The anointing also prefigures the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King, who is often referred to as the Anointed One or Messiah.<p><b>and they have gone up from there with rejoicing</b><br>The ascent from Gihon with rejoicing indicates public celebration and acceptance of Solomon's kingship. This joy reflects the people's relief and hope for a stable and prosperous reign. In biblical terms, rejoicing often accompanies divine favor and fulfillment of God's promises. The communal aspect of this celebration highlights the unity and support for Solomon, contrasting with the earlier attempt by Adonijah to seize the throne.<p><b>that rings out in the city</b><br>The noise of rejoicing ringing out in the city signifies widespread acknowledgment and approval of Solomon's anointing. The city, likely Jerusalem, serves as the political and spiritual center of Israel, and the public celebration there underscores the importance of Solomon's legitimate rule. This public acclamation can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his descendants and the establishment of his kingdom.<p><b>That is the noise you hear</b><br>This phrase addresses the immediate context of the narrative, where Adonijah and his supporters hear the commotion and realize their plans have been thwarted. The noise serves as a divine signal of the rightful king's anointing and the failure of any opposition. It emphasizes the theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of human schemes against His will. This moment foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's chosen leaders, culminating in the reign of Christ, whose kingdom will be established with divine authority and joy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_the_priest.htm">Zadok the Priest</a></b><br>A faithful priest during King David's reign, Zadok played a crucial role in anointing Solomon as king, signifying divine approval and continuity of David's line.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A trusted advisor and prophet to King David, Nathan was instrumental in ensuring Solomon's succession, reflecting God's will and prophetic guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon was chosen by God to succeed David as king, marking the beginning of a reign known for wisdom and prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gihon.htm">Gihon</a></b><br>A significant location near Jerusalem, Gihon was the site of Solomon's anointing, symbolizing a public and divinely sanctioned transition of power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_in_uproar.htm">The City in Uproar</a></b><br>The public celebration and noise in Jerusalem reflect the people's acceptance and joy over Solomon's anointing, indicating a unified support for the new king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>Recognize that leadership and authority are ultimately established by God.
