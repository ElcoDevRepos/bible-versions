Wisdom, in the biblical sense, is not just knowledge but the ability to apply God's principles to life. Solomon is known for his wisdom, which he later famously requests from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). This directive underscores the need for discernment and justice, qualities that are essential for a ruler. The call to act with wisdom reflects the broader biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><b>and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Joab, David's military commander, who had committed acts of violence and treachery (<a href="/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a>). "Gray head" symbolizes old age, and "Sheol" is the Hebrew term for the grave or the abode of the dead. David instructs Solomon to ensure that Joab does not die peacefully, implying that his past actions require justice. This reflects the biblical principle of retributive justice, where wrongdoing must be addressed (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). The cultural context of the time placed a high value on avenging bloodshed, and David's charge to Solomon is consistent with the ancient Near Eastern understanding of justice. This also foreshadows the ultimate justice that will be fulfilled in Christ, who will judge the living and the dead (<a href="/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The aging King of Israel who is giving final instructions to his son Solomon.

David tells Solomon that Joab must face death because of unrecompensed murders (<a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; This underscores that earthly justice often mirrors divine justice: sins concealed on earth still follow a person beyond the grave (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>; <a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; By enforcing the penalty, Solomon would purge innocent blood from Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-9.htm">Deuteronomy 21:9</a>) and uphold God&#8217;s holiness in the kingdom (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in peace</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;In peace&#8221; describes a tranquil, honored death; Joab forfeited that privilege. <a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a> declares, &#8220;There is no peace,&#8221; says the LORD, &#8220;for the wicked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Justice denied would grant Joab a peaceful passing he had denied to Abner and Amasa (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning also serves the nation: true peace cannot rest on unaddressed injustice (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s instruction in <a href="/1_kings/2-6.htm">1 Kings 2:6</a> calls Solomon to exercise God-given wisdom, refuse sentimental partiality toward Joab&#8217;s old age, enforce righteous judgment that leads Joab to the grave, and ensure he does not enjoy an honorable, peaceful death. The verse affirms that leadership under God must balance mercy with unwavering justice, for only then can a kingdom&#8212;and a life&#8212;rest in genuine peace before the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do therefore according to thy wisdom</span> [cf. <a href="/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>. It needed great discretion in exacting the punishment of death in the case of one who was so powerful, who had such influence with the army and the people, whose crimes had been passed over for so long a time, to whom David was so much indebted - Joab had partly won and had twice preserved for him his crown - and to whom he was allied by ties of blood. To act precipitately or unwisely might provoke a revolution], <span class="cmt_word">and let not his hoar head</span> [see on ver. 9. Joab, though David's nephew, could not have been much his junior, and David was now seventy] <span class="cmt_word">go down to the grave in peace.</span> [He must die a violent, not a natural death, as Corn. a Lap. This expression, no doubt, looks vindictive, but that is solely because we forget the character of the Old Testament dispensation (as one of <span class="accented">temporal</span> rewards and punishments. See the "Expositor," vol. 3. p. 114), the position of David as king (as the authorized dispenser of punishments, and as responsible to God for dispensing them without fear or favour), and the principles of the Mosaic code (as a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, demanding blood for blood, and requiring the magistrates and people to purge themselves of the guilt of blood by demanding "the blood of him that shed it"). Let these considerations be borne in mind, and there is absolutely no warrant for charging David with malevolence. Wordsworth lays stress on the fact that Joab had not repented of his crimes. But we need have recourse to no such suppositions. The Jewish law afforded no place of repentance to the murderer. No amount of contrition would cleanse the land of blood. The <span class="accented">temporal</span> penalty must be paid. In the case of David himself, it was only commuted by special revelation (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10, 13, 14</a>), not remitted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So act</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
