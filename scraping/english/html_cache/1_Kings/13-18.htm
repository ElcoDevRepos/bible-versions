The term "prophet" in the Old Testament refers to someone who is believed to be a spokesperson for God, conveying His messages to the people. The context here is a confrontation between two prophets, which is significant in understanding the dynamics of prophetic authority and truth.<p><b>&#8220;I too am a prophet like you,</b><br>The old prophet claims equality in prophetic office with the man of God. This assertion is crucial as it sets the stage for the deception that follows. In the ancient Near Eastern context, prophets were often seen as having direct communication with the divine, and claiming to be a prophet could lend credibility to one's words. This claim of shared identity is a tactic to gain trust.<p><b>and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD,</b><br>The old prophet invokes divine authority by claiming an angelic message. In biblical narratives, angels are often messengers of God, delivering His commands or revelations. This claim is intended to override the original command given to the man of God. The mention of "the word of the LORD" is significant, as it is a phrase used throughout the Bible to denote divine communication, emphasizing the seriousness of the claim.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Bring him back with you to your house,</b><br>The old prophet's invitation to return to his house is a direct contradiction to the command given to the man of God earlier in the chapter, where he was instructed not to eat bread or drink water in Bethel. This phrase highlights the test of obedience and discernment faced by the man of God. The house represents a place of hospitality but also a potential trap in this narrative.<p><b>so that he may eat bread and drink water.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reiterates the specific temptation presented to the man of God. Eating and drinking are basic human needs, and in the cultural context, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. However, in this story, it symbolizes disobedience to God's explicit command. The repetition underscores the gravity of the decision the man of God must make.<p><b>The old prophet was lying to him,</b><br>This final phrase reveals the deceit of the old prophet. The narrative explicitly states the falsehood, highlighting the theme of deception and the importance of discerning truth from falsehood. This deception serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of false prophets and the need for vigilance in adhering to God's commands. It also reflects broader biblical themes of testing and the consequences of disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An unnamed prophet from Bethel who deceives the man of God by claiming divine revelation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message against the altar at Bethel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for its idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deception.htm">The Deception</a></b><br>The old prophet lies about receiving a message from an angel, leading the man of God to disobey God's direct command.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_is_crucial.htm">Discernment is Crucial</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and test all spiritual claims against the truth of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>The account underscores the importance of adhering strictly to God's instructions, regardless of external influences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/beware_of_false_prophets.htm">Beware of False Prophets</a></b><br>Not everyone who claims to speak for God truly does; believers must be vigilant against deception.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The account illustrates that disobedience, even when deceived, can lead to dire consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Compromising God's clear commands for convenience or persuasion can lead to spiritual downfall.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_18_Warning_on_false_teachings.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:18 warn against false teachings and deception today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_discernment_aid_in_divine_messages.htm">What role does discernment play in understanding messages claiming to be from God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Is_the_message_aligned_with_God_s_Word.htm">How can we verify if a message aligns with God's Word and will?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_18_vs_Gal_1_8_on_falsehoods.htm">Compare 1 Kings 13:18 with Galatians 1:8 on false teachings.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_1_Kings_13_18_s_obedience_lesson.htm">How can we apply the lesson of obedience from 1 Kings 13:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_the_prophet_deceive_God_s_man_3.htm">Why did the old prophet lie to the man of God in 1 Kings 13:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_18_vs_prophetic_authority.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:18 challenge the concept of prophetic authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_1_Kings_13_18_teach_discernment.htm">What does 1 Kings 13:18 teach about discerning truth from deception?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_1_kings_19_fit_with_elijah's_story.htm">How does 1 Kings 19 fit with other biblical accounts of Elijah and the broader historical context, considering potential timeline or narrative discrepancies?

By invoking prophetic status and an angelic message, the old prophet appealed to spiritual authority&#8212;an approach reminiscent of Paul&#8217;s warning: &#8220;Even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrator immediately clears up any ambiguity: &#8220;But he was lying to him.&#8221; No hidden motives excuse the deceit; it was a willful falsehood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the deception&#8217;s nature</b><p>&#8226; The lie targeted the younger prophet&#8217;s confidence in God&#8217;s explicit word.

The verse teaches that no claimed revelation, tradition, or authority can override God&#8217;s established word. Faithful obedience means holding fast to what God has already spoken, discerning every new message by Scripture, and refusing any counsel that diminishes or dismisses it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">An angel spake unto me.</span>--The lie was gross, and ought to have been obvious to one who had received a plain command, and must have known that "God was not a man that He should lie, or the son of man that He should repent." It was believed, no doubt, because it chimed in with some secret reluctance to obey, and, by obedience, to give up all reward and hospitality. Hence the belief was a self-deceit, and, as such, culpable. It is inexplicable that the condemnation which it drew down should have been thought strange by any who understands human nature, and knows the self-deceiving colour which our wish gives to our thought. (See the famous Sermon of Bishop Butler on "Self-deceit.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He said unto him; I am a</span> <span class="cmt_word">prophet also as thou art; and an angel</span> (Bahr observes that "he does not venture to say that Jehovah spake to him, but says an angel did." Is it not more probable that the angel was mentioned, partly for the purpose of giving an air of circumstantiality and reality to his story, and partly to convey the idea of his having a superior authority for his message? A communication through a celestial messenger would seem to have been regarded as a higher form of revelation than a subjective communication to the mind of the prophet. Cf. <a href="/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13, 29</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>, etc. Observe, the prophet speaks presently of "the word of Jehovah"] <span class="cmt_word">spake unto me by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>; same expression as in ver. 17] <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">he shall eat</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>bread and drink water.
