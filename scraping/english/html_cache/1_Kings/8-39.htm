Heaven is often depicted as God's throne (<a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>), emphasizing His sovereignty and authority over creation. The temple in Jerusalem, where Solomon is praying, is seen as a symbolic dwelling place of God on earth, yet Solomon recognizes that God's true dwelling is in heaven (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). This reflects the belief in God's omnipresence and His ability to hear prayers from anywhere.<p><b>And may You forgive and act,</b><br>Forgiveness is a central theme in the Bible, highlighting God's mercy and grace. Solomon's request for God to forgive indicates an understanding of human sinfulness and the need for divine intervention. The act of forgiveness is often linked with repentance and is a precursor to God taking action on behalf of His people. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where forgiveness leads to restoration and blessing (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><b>and repay each man according to all his ways,</b><br>This phrase underscores the biblical principle of divine justice, where God rewards or punishes individuals based on their actions. It echoes the teachings found in Proverbs and Psalms, where the righteous are rewarded, and the wicked face consequences (<a href="/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, <a href="/psalms/62-12.htm">Psalm 62:12</a>). This principle is also seen in the New Testament, where Paul speaks of God repaying each person according to their deeds (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>).<p><b>since You know his heart&#8212;</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, represents the inner being, including thoughts, emotions, and intentions. God's knowledge of the heart signifies His omniscience and ability to discern true motives beyond outward actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This understanding is crucial for divine judgment, as God evaluates not just actions but the intentions behind them.<p><b>for You alone know the hearts of all men&#8212;</b><br>This statement affirms God's unique ability to fully understand human nature, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Unlike humans, who can only see outward appearances, God sees the true condition of the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>). This divine attribute is essential for fair and just judgment, as only God can accurately assess the sincerity and faithfulness of individuals. This also points to the need for a personal relationship with God, who knows and understands each person intimately.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

Because heaven is His throne (<a href="/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>) and He &#8220;does whatever pleases Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>), the king knows the Lord is fully able to tune in to petitions offered on earth (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a>). The verse assumes&#8212;literally&#8212;that prayer reaches the ear of a God who is both transcendent and attentive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your dwelling place</b><p>The words remind Israel that the Most High&#8217;s home is not an earthly structure but the heavenly realm (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). Though the newly finished temple is important, it is only a symbol of that greater reality (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). Believers today still direct their cries upward, confident that the risen Christ &#8220;appears in God&#8217;s presence for us.&#8221;<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God is not confined to buildings.<p>&#8226; Earthly worship connects with a real location in heaven (<a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Our assurance rests on where God is, not where we are.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And may You forgive and act</b><p>Solomon ties hearing to action. Forgiveness is not abstract; the Lord responds by lifting guilt (<a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>) and intervening in practical ways (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The order matters: God first pardons, then works. His cleansing clears the way for His providence.<p>For us:<p>&#8226; Confession is non-negotiable (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Expect tangible change when God removes sin (<a href="/daniel/9-19.htm">Daniel 9:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And repay each man according to all his ways</b><p>A just Judge must deal with people individually. Scripture repeats this principle: &#8220;I, the LORD, search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). The verse is both comfort and warning&#8212;comfort that righteousness is noticed, warning that hidden rebellion is too.<p>Bullet points:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s accounting is personal, not group-graded.<p>&#8226; Both reward and discipline flow from perfect justice (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Final judgment will mirror present patterns of life (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since You know his heart</b><p>Why can God judge fairly? Because nothing escapes His gaze. &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). That inner knowledge exposes hypocrisy yet also validates sincere faith (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>Implications:<p>&#8226; We cannot hide motives behind religious activity.<p>&#8226; Genuine repentance matters more than polished words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For You alone know the hearts of all men</b><p>The clause underscores exclusivity. Angels, prophets, pastors&#8212;none can read hearts. Only God and His Son possess that omniscience (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>). Therefore He alone has the right to forgive, act, and repay.<p>Encouragement:<p>&#8226; Because divine knowledge is complete, prayer can be honest.<p>&#8226; Because His knowledge is exclusive, judgment will be unmistakably fair.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/8-39.htm">1 Kings 8:39</a> reveals a God who hears from His heavenly home, forgives sin, intervenes in life, and judges every person with perfect, heart-level knowledge. Solomon&#8217;s words reassure believers that no plea is unheard, no confession ignored, and no deed overlooked. The verse invites us to pray boldly, repent sincerely, and live expectantly, knowing the Lord who dwells in heaven is actively involved on earth and will deal with each soul in absolute justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)</span> [<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>.
