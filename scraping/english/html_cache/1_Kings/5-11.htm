The regularity of the provision underscores the stability and prosperity of Solomon's reign, as well as the importance of maintaining strong diplomatic relations. This ongoing provision reflects the peace and cooperation between Israel and Tyre, which was crucial for Solomon's building projects, including the Temple.<p><b>Solomon would provide Hiram</b><br>Solomon, the king of Israel, is known for his wisdom and wealth. His ability to provide for Hiram, the king of Tyre, highlights his resources and the prosperity of his kingdom. Hiram was a significant ally, providing materials and skilled labor for the construction of the Temple. This relationship is a testament to Solomon's diplomatic skills and the mutual benefits of their alliance.<p><b>with 20,000 cors of wheat</b><br>A "cor" is a Hebrew unit of measure, roughly equivalent to about 6 bushels or 220 liters. Providing 20,000 cors of wheat indicates a substantial amount of grain, reflecting the agricultural productivity of Israel under Solomon's rule. This provision would have been essential for sustaining Hiram's household and possibly his workforce, emphasizing the economic interdependence between the two kingdoms.<p><b>as food for his household</b><br>The term "household" likely refers to Hiram's royal court and possibly his labor force. This provision of food signifies the importance of maintaining the well-being of those who were instrumental in supporting Solomon's building projects. It also reflects the cultural practice of gift-giving and reciprocity in ancient Near Eastern diplomacy.<p><b>as well as 20,000 baths of pure olive oil</b><br>A "bath" is another unit of measure, approximately 6 gallons or 22 liters. Olive oil was a valuable commodity in the ancient world, used for cooking, lighting, and religious rituals. The mention of "pure" olive oil suggests a high-quality product, indicating the wealth and resources of Solomon's kingdom. This provision would have been a significant contribution to Hiram's economy and daily life.<br><br>This exchange between Solomon and Hiram is a practical example of international relations in the ancient world, where resources and goods were exchanged to maintain alliances and support large-scale projects. The cooperation between these two kings also foreshadows the peace and prosperity associated with the Messianic kingdom, where nations will come together in harmony.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>The King of Tyre, an ally of Solomon, who provided materials and skilled labor for the construction of the Temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Phoenicia, known for its trade and skilled craftsmen.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheat_and_olive_oil.htm">Wheat and Olive Oil</a></b><br>Essential commodities in the ancient Near East, symbolizing sustenance and prosperity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_agreement.htm">The Agreement</a></b><br>A mutual agreement between Solomon and Hiram, showcasing international diplomacy and cooperation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_alliances.htm">The Importance of Alliances</a></b><br>Solomon's relationship with Hiram demonstrates the value of forming strategic alliances.
