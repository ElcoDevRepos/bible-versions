The concept of retributive justice is prevalent throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes that whoever sheds human blood will have their blood shed by humans. This principle is also echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, which states that a person reaps what they sow. The phrase underscores the belief that God is sovereign and just, holding individuals accountable for their actions.<p><b>for without the knowledge of my father David</b><br>This highlights the deceitful nature of the actions taken by Joab, who acted independently and without the consent of King David. David's ignorance of Joab's actions is significant because it absolves David of direct responsibility for the murders. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where leaders are unaware of the actions of their subordinates, such as King Saul's ignorance of Jonathan's actions in <a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in leadership.<p><b>he struck down two men more righteous and better than he</b><br>The comparison of Joab to Abner and Amasa suggests that these men were unjustly killed and were of noble character. The Bible often contrasts the righteous with the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>, which describes the blessings of the righteous and the downfall of the wicked. This phrase serves to highlight the injustice of Joab's actions and the moral superiority of his victims, aligning with the biblical theme of God defending the righteous.<p><b>when he put to the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel&#8217;s army</b><br>Abner was a significant military leader in Israel, initially serving under King Saul and later supporting Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. His murder by Joab is recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>, where Joab kills Abner in Hebron, a city of refuge, violating the sanctity of the place. Abner's death was politically motivated, as Joab saw him as a rival. This act of treachery is condemned in the biblical narrative, illustrating the destructive nature of jealousy and ambition.<p><b>and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah&#8217;s army</b><br>Amasa was appointed by David as commander of the army in place of Joab, as recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>. His murder by Joab is detailed in <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>, where Joab deceitfully kills Amasa during a time of peace. This act of betrayal further demonstrates Joab's ruthless ambition and disregard for loyalty and justice. Amasa's death serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of power struggles and the importance of integrity in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of David, who is speaking in this verse.
