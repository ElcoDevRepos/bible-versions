Elijah is instructed by God to drink from this brook during a time of drought, highlighting God's provision in times of scarcity. The brook's location in a remote area emphasizes Elijah's separation from society, a common theme for prophets who often retreat to wilderness areas for spiritual renewal and divine encounters. This setting also mirrors the Israelites' reliance on God's provision during their wilderness journey in Exodus.<p><b>and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.</b><br>Ravens, considered unclean animals according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>), are used by God to sustain Elijah, demonstrating His sovereignty and ability to use any means to fulfill His purposes. This act of provision foreshadows God's miraculous feeding of His people, such as the manna in the desert (Exodus 16) and Jesus feeding the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>). The use of ravens also symbolizes God's care for His creation, as seen in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>, where He mentions ravens to illustrate God's provision.

The singularly prosaic interpretations, substituted for this striking and significant record of miracle by some ancient and modern writers (adopting slight variations of the Hebrew vowel points)--such as "Arabs," "merchants," "inhabitants of a city Orbi or the rock Oreb"--seem to have arisen simply from a desire to get rid of what seemed a strange miracle, at the cost (be it observed) of substituting for it a gross improbability; for how can it be supposed that such regular sustenance by human hands of the persecuted prophet could have gone on in the face of the jealous vigilance of the king? But it is idle to seek to explain away one wonder in a life and an epoch teeming with miracles. It is notable, indeed, that the critical period of the great Baal apostasy, and of the struggle of Elijah and Elisha against it, is the second great epoch of recorded miracle in the Old Testament--the still more critical epoch of Moses and Joshua being the first. It is hardly less idle to determine that this or that miracle is so improbable, as to introduce any difficulty of acceptance which does not apply to miracles in general.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook</span> [There was clearly nothing miraculous about the supply of <span class="accented">water</span>. No miracle was wrought even to continue the supply, ver. 7]; <span class="cmt_word">and I have commanded</span> [cf. ver. 9; <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">the ravens to feed thee there.</span> [Despite the general agreement of scholars that by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> we <span class="accented">must</span> understand "ravens," I think probability favours the meaning <span class="accented">Orbites, i.e.</span>, inhabitants of Orbo. In support of the received rendering is the very powerful consideration, that it is the interpretation of all the versions (except the Arabic) and of Josephus, who, beyond all question, represented the belief current in his own time (Ant. 8:13. 2). It is also certain that elsewhere in Scripture we find some of the inferior animals supernaturally constrained to effect God's purposes, both of mercy and of judgment (<a href="/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>), though never it must be said, in so rational and methodical a way. Nor can it rightly be contended that the words "I have commanded," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, imply human agency, for elsewhere we find the Almighty <span class="accented">commanding</span> (same word) the serpent (<a href="/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>) and the clouds (<a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>). It is not, however, a sufficient account of this narrative to say that the prophet merely helped himself to the food which the ravens, whose <span class="accented">habitat</span> was in the Wady Cherith, brought, day by day, to their nests and their young. For, not to insist on the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">bringing to him</span> (ver. 6), the expressions '" bread (or <span class="accented">food</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) and flesh," and "morning and evening" certainly point to something more than such a fortuitous supply. Whether the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were "ravens" or not, they certainly acted in an intelligent and rational way: they brought food, that is to say, to the <span class="accented">prophet</span>, and they brought it for months together with unfailing regularity. But against this view the following considerations may be urged. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It is hardly in accord with God's <span class="accented">usual</span> way of working, that he should employ birds of the air and those unclean (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>) and ravenous birds, to feed and succour His saints, rather than men or angels. Of course, no one who does not altogether repudiate the supernatural will deny for a moment that the Almighty <span class="accented">could, had</span> it seemed good to Him, have sustained His prophet by the instrumentality of ravens, just as easily as by any other means. But it appears to be almost a fixed principle of His dealings with men, not to resort to miracles when ordinary means will suffice; or if He does employ miracles, they are never <span class="accented">bizarre</span> or fantastic; they are not such as to suggest the idea of fable or legend; they are invariably the simplest and directest means to the end. And it is submitted that this prolonged and methodical ministry of ravens is altogether unlike God's method of procedure on other occasions. It was an angel succoured Hagar and Ishmael in their need (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>). It was an angel fed Elijah himself, a few years later (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 6</a>). They were angels who ministered to our blessed Lord after His long fast (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). But God's,' chief means," it is always to be remembered, "is man." And it is to be carefully observed that when, about this very time, not one, but one hundred prophets were threatened, just as Elijah was, with death, <span class="cmt_word">no</span> miracle was wrought to save their lives or to supply their wants, but they were fed by human agency, with bread and water (<a href="/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). But it is still more significant that elsewhere in this narrative, which is characterized by the profoundest sobriety and reticence, there is what we may almost call a studied absence of the miraculous element. No miracle is wrought to protect Elijah against Jezebel, but he must consult for his own safety by flight. He is sent to the brook Cherith, because there is <span class="accented">water</span> there; in other words, God chose that hiding place in order to obviate the necessity for a miracle. And when the water of the brook dries up, no miracle is wrought to prolong the supply, but the prophet, at the risk of detection, must go forth and seek it elsewhere. And at Zarephath he is fed, not by ravens, but by human agency - by a widow woman. It is true a miracle appears to have been wrought, but the narrative has so little idea of effect and gives so little prominence to the supernatural that even that is doubted. To put the interpretation of "ravens," consequently, on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, provided it will yield any other meaning, appears to be to do violence to the spirit of the context, and to the tenour of Scripture generally. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is somewhat difficult to believe that such a prodigy as this, so altogether unique and irregular, would not have been mentioned, had it really happened, elsewhere in Scripture. The absence of all reference thereto is remarkable, when we consider how constantly the ministry of Elijah and its lessons (<a href="/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25, 26</a>; <a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5, 6</a>) are referred to in the New Testament; but when we observe what an admirable and unequalled illustration of God's providential care this incident would have supplied to some of our Lord's discourses, and notably to that of <a href="/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a> sqq., this silence becomes almost suspicious. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Despite the practical unanimity of the versions, the interpretation "ravens" has been disputed from very early times. St. Jerome among Christians, Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh and Kimchi amongst Jews - these are but some of those who have repudiated this rendering.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/17-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
