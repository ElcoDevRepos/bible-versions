The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting burial in a family tomb or joining ancestors in the afterlife. Ahab's reign was marked by significant idolatry, largely influenced by his marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess who promoted the worship of Baal. His death fulfilled the prophecy given by the prophet Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>, where it was foretold that dogs would lick Ahab's blood. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of the consequences of sin and disobedience to God, as Ahab's life and reign were characterized by turning away from the Lord.<p><b>and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place</b><br>Ahaziah, Ahab's son, succeeded him as king of Israel. His reign, which lasted from approximately 853 to 852 BC, was brief and continued in the idolatrous practices of his father. Ahaziah's rule is noted for his alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and his unsuccessful attempt to revive maritime trade by building ships at Ezion-Geber, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48-49</a>. The transition of power from Ahab to Ahaziah highlights the dynastic succession common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. Ahaziah's reign is also significant in the biblical narrative for its continuation of the spiritual decline of Israel, setting the stage for further prophetic confrontations, particularly with the prophet Elijah. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of generational influence, where the actions and faith of one generation impact the next.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The seventh king of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into sin.

The expression &#8220;rested with his fathers&#8221; is the standard biblical way of saying a king has died and been buried with his ancestors (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; 11:43).<p>&#8226; The wording reminds us that death overtakes every ruler, no matter how powerful. God had foretold Ahab&#8217;s end through Elijah: &#8220;In the place where the dogs licked Naboth&#8217;s blood, the dogs will lick your blood as well&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). That prophecy came to pass when &#8220;the dogs licked up his blood&#8221; at Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/22-38.htm">1 Kings 22:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahab&#8217;s death punctuates the certainty of divine judgment. Even when he temporarily humbled himself (<a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27&#8211;29</a>), he returned to rebellion, and God&#8217;s word stood firm. See <a href="/psalms/9-16.htm">Psalm 9:16</a> and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> for the principle that judgment follows death.<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at a finality: Ahab&#8217;s opportunity to repent is over. <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a> and <a href="/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a> underscore that post-mortem destinies are fixed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place</b><p>&#8226; Dynastic succession was expected, yet it is striking that no moral improvement came with the new king. Ahaziah &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD and walked in the way of his father&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership changes do not guarantee spiritual renewal; hearts must change. Compare <a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2&#8211;4</a>, where Ahaziah seeks guidance from Baal-zebub instead of the LORD, repeating his father&#8217;s idolatry (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows God&#8217;s patience: although judgment fell on Ahab, the northern kingdom was not immediately wiped out. Yet the continued sin of its rulers hastened its eventual fall (<a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the transition warns against assuming the next generation will naturally follow God. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a> calls parents to teach God&#8217;s commands diligently so that faith does not fade.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/22-40.htm">1 Kings 22:40</a> closes Ahab&#8217;s story and opens Ahaziah&#8217;s. Ahab&#8217;s death fulfills prophetic judgment, proving the reliability of God&#8217;s word. Ahaziah&#8217;s accession highlights how entrenched sin can persist through generations when hearts remain unchanged. The verse invites us to trust Scripture&#8217;s accuracy regarding both judgment and grace, and to seek genuine personal devotion that breaks destructive cycles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah</span> ["Whom Jehovah upholds."
