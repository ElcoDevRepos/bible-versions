Zarephath was a Phoenician city located between Tyre and Sidon, outside of Israel, indicating God's sovereignty extends beyond Israel. This journey signifies a test of faith, as Elijah moves from a place of safety to a region under the influence of Jezebel's father, King Ethbaal. The name Zarephath means "smelting place," symbolizing a place of refining, both for Elijah and the widow he would encounter.<p><b>When he arrived at the city gate,</b><br>The city gate was a place of social and economic activity, where people gathered, and legal matters were addressed. Elijah's arrival at the gate signifies the beginning of a divine encounter. Gates often symbolize transition points in the Bible, marking the entrance into new phases of God's plan.<p><b>there was a widow gathering sticks.</b><br>Widows in ancient times were often among the most vulnerable, lacking a husband's protection and provision. Her gathering sticks indicates her poverty and desperation, as she prepares for what she believes to be her last meal. This encounter highlights God's care for the marginalized and foreshadows the miraculous provision to come. Widows are frequently mentioned in Scripture as recipients of God's compassion and justice (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><b>Elijah called to her and said,</b><br>Elijah's approach to the widow is direct and purposeful, reflecting his role as a prophet who speaks God's word. His interaction with her is a divine appointment, orchestrated by God to demonstrate His power and provision. Prophets often served as God's mouthpiece, bringing messages of hope and challenge.<p><b>&#8220;Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.&#8221;</b><br>Water, a basic necessity, was scarce during the drought Elijah had prophesied. His request tests the widow's willingness to share her limited resources, setting the stage for a miracle. This act of faith parallels Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4), where a simple request for water leads to a deeper revelation of God's provision. Elijah's request also echoes the hospitality theme found throughout Scripture, where providing for others often leads to divine blessing (e.g., <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>, <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his faithfulness and miraculous acts.

No delay, no debate.<p>- Zarephath lay in Sidon, outside Israel&#8217;s borders. By stepping into pagan territory, Elijah lived out God&#8217;s heart for the nations&#8212;foreshadowed by Jesus&#8217; mention of this story in <a href="/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25-26</a>.<p>- Obedience during famine required faith. Earlier, God sustained Elijah at the brook Cherith (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2-6</a>), proving He could be trusted again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he arrived at the city gate</b><p>- The gate was the hub of community life, where business was settled and strangers met (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>). Elijah positions himself where providence can unfold.<p>- Gates also picture decision points (<a href="/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>).

God singles out just such a person, showing His character (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>).<p>- Her gathering &#8220;sticks&#8221; signals poverty; she will later confess she has &#8220;only a handful of flour&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12</a>).<p>- God often chooses the unlikely&#8212;think of the widow&#8217;s two mites in <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>&#8212;to showcase His power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elijah called to her and said</b><p>- Elijah initiates. God&#8217;s servants do not wait passively (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>).<p>- The call parallels Jesus&#8217; approach to the Samaritan woman: &#8220;Give Me a drink&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7</a>). Divine encounters often begin with simple requests.<p>- By speaking first, Elijah creates space for God&#8217;s next miracle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink."</b><p>- Water was scarce during drought (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).

Elijah goes where God sends, stands where people gather, notices a destitute widow, and begins with a modest request. In doing so, he sets the stage for God to reveal His compassion and power. The verse teaches that simple steps&#8212;going, standing available, speaking kindly, and asking for small acts of kindness&#8212;become channels for the LORD&#8217;s larger miracles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he arose and went to Zarephath</span> [It does not follow that his route lay over the "White Promontory," or Ladder of Tyre, the way our Lord took when He "departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon" (<a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>).
