Asa was a king of Judah known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid the land of idolatry, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9-24</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/14.htm">2 Chronicles 14-16</a>. His reign is often seen as a period of relative stability and faithfulness to God in Judah, contrasting with the turmoil and idolatry in the northern kingdom of Israel.<p><b>Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel</b><br>Elah's ascension to the throne follows the reign of his father, Baasha, who had seized power by assassinating the previous king, Nadab, and exterminating the house of Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27-30</a>). Baasha's dynasty was marked by violence and idolatry, and Elah's rule would continue in this vein. The mention of Elah as the son of Baasha highlights the dynastic succession, which was often unstable in the northern kingdom due to frequent coups and assassinations.<p><b>and he reigned in Tirzah</b><br>Tirzah served as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel before the establishment of Samaria by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It was a significant city during this period, known for its beauty and strategic location. Archaeological evidence suggests that Tirzah was a fortified city, which would have been important for the defense and administration of the kingdom.<p><b>two years</b><br>Elah's short reign of two years indicates a period of instability and foreshadows his violent end. His brief rule is a reflection of the political turmoil in Israel, where kings often faced threats from within their own ranks. This instability is a recurring theme in the history of the northern kingdom, contrasting with the longer and more stable reigns in Judah. Elah's assassination by Zimri, one of his officials, is recorded in <a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9-10</a>, continuing the cycle of violence and upheaval.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elah.htm">Elah</a></b><br>The son of Baasha, who became king of Israel.

Asa had been a faithful king in Judah for a long stretch (see <a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-13.htm">2 Chronicles 16:13</a>), so the writer uses his well-known reign as a calendar marker.<p>&#8226; By placing events in Asa&#8217;s twenty-sixth year, Scripture synchronizes the timelines of the two kingdoms, letting us trace God&#8217;s dealings with both Israel and Judah side by side (compare <a href="/1_kings/15-33.htm">1 Kings 15:33</a> for Baasha&#8217;s accession in Asa&#8217;s third year).<p>&#8226; The detail underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over history: every year, month, and king is under His watchful eye (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Elah&#8217;s rise is directly tied to his father Baasha, who had seized the throne by force (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27&#8211;30</a>). The dynasty is already shaky because Baasha provoked the Lord&#8217;s anger through idolatry, just as Jeroboam had (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Passing the crown from Baasha to Elah shows that human power can look secure for a moment, yet it stands or falls according to the Lord&#8217;s word (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The text quietly reminds us of the spiritual temperature in Israel: leadership that ignores the covenant inevitably breeds instability (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Tirzah two years</b><p>&#8226; Tirzah served as Israel&#8217;s capital before Omri built Samaria (compare <a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>; 16:15, 23). Its mention highlights how rapidly power centers shifted in the northern kingdom.<p>&#8226; Elah&#8217;s two-year reign is strikingly brief. Scripture will soon explain why: Elah is assassinated while drunk (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Short reigns in Israel often signal divine judgment for ongoing sin (see Nadab&#8217;s two years, <a href="/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25&#8211;26</a>). God&#8217;s warnings through prophets (<a href="/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1&#8211;4</a>) are not empty; they come to pass exactly as spoken.<p>&#8226; For readers today, Elah&#8217;s fleeting rule is a sobering reminder that sin can cut a life or legacy short (<a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8</a> records a precise historical moment, showing God&#8217;s meticulous oversight of time and kings. Elah inherits a throne already under judgment, and his brief two-year reign in Tirzah underscores how quickly God can overturn ungodly power. The verse sets the stage for the swift fulfillment of prophetic warning, teaching that every dynasty&#8212;and every life&#8212;stands secure only when aligned with the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the twenty and sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, began Elah, son of Baasha, to reign over Israel, two years</span> [cf. ch. 15. and see note on 1 Kings 15:28]. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the twenty-sixth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
