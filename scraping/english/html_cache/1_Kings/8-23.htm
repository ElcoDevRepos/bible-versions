Solomon, as king, acts as an intercessor for the people, highlighting the importance of prayer and communication with God.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD, God of Israel,</b><br>The invocation of "O LORD" uses the divine name Yahweh, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This title acknowledges God's unique relationship with Israel, chosen as His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>there is no God like You</b><br>This statement affirms the monotheistic belief central to Israel's faith, contrasting with the polytheistic cultures surrounding them. It echoes the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) and underscores God's uniqueness and supremacy.<p><b>in heaven above or on earth below,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty over all creation, both celestial and terrestrial. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of a tiered universe but asserts that God transcends all realms.<p><b>keeping Your covenant of loving devotion</b><br>The covenant refers to the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David. "Loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," indicating steadfast love and faithfulness, a key attribute of God (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p><b>with Your servants</b><br>"Servants" refers to those who are faithful to God, including the patriarchs, prophets, and the nation of Israel. It highlights the reciprocal relationship between God and His people, where service is a response to divine grace.<p><b>who walk before You</b><br>This phrase implies living a life in accordance with God's will, reminiscent of Enoch and Noah, who "walked with God" (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24, 6</a>:9). It suggests a life of obedience and righteousness.<p><b>with all their hearts.</b><br>The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of will and emotion. This phrase calls for wholehearted devotion, aligning with the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>), and foreshadows Jesus' teaching on the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem and is offering this prayer of dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord.htm">LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is being addressed in Solomon's prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, to whom the covenant was given.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The newly constructed temple where Solomon is dedicating this prayer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and His people, emphasizing His faithfulness and loving devotion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_uniqueness.htm">God's Uniqueness</a></b><br>Recognize and worship God for His unparalleled nature.

It begins (<span class= "ital">a</span>), in <a href="/context/1_kings/8-23.htm" title="And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keep covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:">1Kings 8:23-25</a>, with a thankful acknowledgment of the fulfilment of one part of the great promise to David, and a prayer for the like fulfilment of the other; next (<span class= "ital">b</span>), in <a href="/context/1_kings/8-26.htm" title="And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.">1Kings 8:26-30</a>, acknowledging that God's presence can be limited to no Temple, it yet Asks that His peculiar blessing may rest on prayer uttered toward the place which He has hallowed; and then (<span class= "ital">c</span>), in <a href="/context/1_kings/8-31.htm" title="If any man trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid on him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your altar in this house:">1Kings 8:31-53</a>, applies that petition to the various contingencies, of oath taken in His name, of rain withheld, of disaster in battle, of famine and pestilence, of captivity in a foreign land, and extends it not only to Israel, but to the stranger who shall acknowledge and invoke the Lord Jehovah. Its constantly recurring burden is, "Hear Thou from heaven thy dwelling-place, and when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive." It is plain that before Solomon's mind there are continually present in some form the blessing and the curse pronounced in the Law (see Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28); and it is most true to human nature, and especially characteristic of the thoughtfulness of his philosophic temper, that over the bright hour of exultation there seems to hover a constant foreboding of evils and trials to come.<p>(23) <span class= "bld">There is no God like Thee.</span>--These words, often used in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/71-19.htm" title="Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, who have done great things: O God, who is like to you!">Psalm 71:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-8.htm" title="Among the gods there is none like to you, O Lord; neither are there any works like to your works.">Psalm 86:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-6.htm" title="For who in the heaven can be compared to the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the LORD?">Psalm 89:6</a>), and especially found in the thanksgiving of David after the great promise (<a href="/2_samuel/7-22.htm" title="Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.">2Samuel 7:22</a>), are evidently suggested by more ancient utterances of devotion; as for example, in the first recorded Psalm at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>). In them we trace the spiritual process by which the Israelites were trained from the polytheism of their forefathers to the knowledge of the One only God. He is known to them, first, in the close personal relation of "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," to whom "none is like" of all gods whom others worshipped; but next, in His universal relation to the universe as the "God Almighty, and the Judge of the whole earth" (<a href="/genesis/17-2.htm" title="And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.">Genesis 17:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm" title="That be far from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?">Genesis 18:25</a>); lastly, as Jehovah, "God," indeed, "of Israel," but, by the very meaning of the name, the One Self-existent Being, source of all other life. Thus, in the thanksgiving of David to the words, "none is like Thee," is added at once the higher belief, "there is no God beside Thee." In this prayer of Solomon there follows at once the striking confession that the "heaven of heavens cannot contain" His Infinity. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Lord God of Israel</span>, <span class="cmt_word">there is no God like thee</span> [Similar words are found in <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a>, etc. They do not at all imply the existence of other gods, but are explained by other passages (<span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., ver. 60; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-39.htm">Deuteronomy 4:39</a>, "the Lord He is God and <span class="accented">none else</span>;" <a href="/2_samuel/7-22.htm">2 Samuel 7:22</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-32.htm">2 Samuel 22:32</a>) as meaning that the God of Israel stands alone, and alone is God.
