Despite serving under a wicked king, Obadiah was a devout follower of Yahweh, as indicated earlier in the chapter. His journey likely involved duties related to the severe drought in Israel, a punishment from God due to the nation's idolatry. This highlights the tension between serving in a secular position while maintaining personal faithfulness to God.<p><b>Elijah suddenly met him</b><br>Elijah, the prophet, had been in hiding due to the persecution of prophets by Jezebel, Ahab's wife. His sudden appearance signifies a divine appointment, as Elijah was on a mission to confront Ahab and challenge the prophets of Baal. This encounter underscores the theme of divine intervention and the courage required to stand for truth in hostile environments.<p><b>When Obadiah recognized him</b><br>Obadiah's recognition of Elijah suggests familiarity and respect. Elijah was a well-known prophet, and his presence would have been significant, especially during a time of national crisis. This recognition also indicates that Obadiah was attuned to the things of God, able to discern the presence of God's messenger.<p><b>he fell facedown</b><br>This act of falling facedown is a gesture of deep respect and reverence, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures when encountering someone of great authority or divine representation. It reflects Obadiah's acknowledgment of Elijah's role as a prophet of God and his own humility before God's chosen servant.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Is it you, my lord Elijah?&#8221;</b><br>The title "my lord" indicates respect and acknowledgment of Elijah's authority as a prophet. Obadiah's question reveals a mix of surprise and reverence, as Elijah's sudden appearance was unexpected. This encounter foreshadows the significant events to follow, where Elijah would demonstrate God's power over the false gods of Baal, pointing to the ultimate authority of Yahweh. Elijah's role as a prophet can be seen as a type of Christ, who also confronted falsehood and revealed the true nature of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the Lord who served as the palace administrator under King Ahab.

Obadiah&#8217;s obedience in a hostile environment highlights steadfast commitment to God even while serving under an ungodly ruler (cf. <a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God moving in ordinary journeys; a servant &#8220;on his way&#8221; becomes an instrument for divine purpose, just as Saul was &#8220;on the road to Damascus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>) and Philip was &#8220;on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elijah suddenly met him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Suddenly&#8221; underscores God&#8217;s sovereign timing. After three years in hiding (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2-3</a>; 18:1), Elijah appears at the exact moment Obadiah is available, showing the precision of God&#8217;s appointments (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine encounters are rarely accidents. Similar sudden meetings&#8212;Jacob with angels (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>) or Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>)&#8212;demonstrate how God interrupts routine to advance His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Obadiah recognized him</b><p>&#8226; Recognition suggests prior knowledge and relationship. Obadiah had likely heard firsthand accounts of Elijah&#8217;s earlier proclamations (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as the disciples recognized the risen Lord and their hearts burned within them (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31-32</a>), God&#8217;s servants have discernment to identify His messengers (<a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He fell facedown</b><p>&#8226; Obadiah&#8217;s posture reflects reverence toward God&#8217;s prophet, a gesture seen when Abram &#8220;fell facedown&#8221; before the LORD (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>) and Joshua did likewise before the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Bowing signals humility and submission, acknowledging that speaking with Elijah is akin to standing before God&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And said, &#8220;Is it you, my lord Elijah?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Calling Elijah &#8220;my lord&#8221; conveys respect and recognizes spiritual authority (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The question hints at mixed emotions&#8212;joy, awe, and fear. Obadiah knows Elijah is a wanted man (<a href="/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10-12</a>) and that association could cost his life. Yet he cannot deny the truth standing before him, much like the disciples who were &#8220;startled and frightened&#8221; yet compelled to believe when Jesus appeared (<a href="/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37-40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/18-7.htm">1 Kings 18:7</a> portrays a divinely timed encounter between two faithful men walking distinct yet converging paths. Obadiah&#8217;s routine duty becomes a crossroads where God&#8217;s hidden prophet re-enters the public stage. Recognition leads to reverence; reverence births readiness for further obedience. The verse reminds us that God arranges meetings, reveals His servants at the perfect moment, and calls His people to honor His word with humble, immediate response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Art thou that . . .</span>--The sense is either (as the LXX. has it) "Is it thy very self, my lord Elijah?" or (perhaps more suitably to the context), "Thou here, my lord Elijah," when all seek thy life?
