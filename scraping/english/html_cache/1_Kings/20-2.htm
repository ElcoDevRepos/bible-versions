The sending of messengers signifies a diplomatic approach, which was common in the ancient Near East. This method allowed for negotiation and the delivery of terms without immediate conflict. The city referred to here is Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was established by King Omri, Ahab's father. Samaria was strategically located and fortified, making it a significant political and military center.<p><b>to Ahab king of Israel</b><br>Ahab was the seventh king of Israel and reigned during a time of significant political and religious turmoil. His marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess, led to the introduction and promotion of Baal worship in Israel, which was in direct opposition to the worship of Yahweh. Ahab's reign is marked by his conflicts with the prophets of Yahweh, particularly Elijah, and his alliances with surrounding nations. The mention of Ahab as king of Israel highlights the divided monarchy period, where Israel and Judah were separate kingdoms. Ahab's rule is often characterized by his attempts to strengthen Israel politically and militarily, but his religious apostasy brought divine judgment upon his house. This context sets the stage for the ensuing conflict with Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, who is sending the messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who is a central figure in this chapter.

It marks a real moment in history when Ben-hadad chose to act, reminding us that God&#8217;s Word records events, not legends (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>- Scripture often uses &#8220;then&#8221; to signal a turning point where God&#8217;s purposes move forward&#8212;think of <a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a> when the Red Sea opened, or <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15&#8211;17</a> when Judah heard, &#8220;the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221;<p>- Here, the turning point is the enemy&#8217;s demand; soon another &#8220;then&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>) will announce the Lord&#8217;s deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he sent messengers</b><p>- Ben-hadad never speaks to Ahab face-to-face; intimidation travels through intermediaries, as in <a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a> when Assyria&#8217;s Rabshakeh taunted Jerusalem.<p>- Envoys in ancient warfare delivered ultimatums meant to crush morale (<a href="/judges/11-12.htm">Judges 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2</a>). Ben-hadad relies on words before weapons, yet <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a> reminds us, &#8220;There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD.&#8221;<p>- God later turns these very messages against Ben-hadad, proving <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a> true: &#8220;The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the city</b><p>- The messengers walk right through Samaria&#8217;s gates&#8212;evidence the siege has not yet starved the city (contrast <a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24&#8211;25</a>).

Soon a prophet tells Ahab, &#8220;I will deliver it into your hand today, and you will know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a>).
