Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, had allied himself with Ahab, the king of Israel, to fight against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead. This alliance is significant as it shows the political and military strategies of the time, where smaller kingdoms often formed alliances to combat larger threats. Jehoshaphat's presence on the battlefield highlights the unity between Judah and Israel, despite their historical divisions.<p><b>they said, &#8220;Surely this is the king of Israel!&#8221;</b><br>The commanders mistook Jehoshaphat for Ahab, the king of Israel, because Ahab had instructed Jehoshaphat to wear his royal robes while he himself disguised himself. This reflects the common practice of targeting the king in battle to demoralize the enemy forces. The confusion also underscores the deceptive tactics employed by Ahab, which ultimately led to his downfall, fulfilling the prophecy of Micaiah regarding Ahab's death.<p><b>So they turned to fight against him</b><br>The Aramean chariot commanders redirected their attack towards Jehoshaphat, believing him to be Ahab. This action demonstrates the intensity and chaos of ancient warfare, where identifying and eliminating the enemy's leader was a primary objective. The focus on Jehoshaphat also illustrates the vulnerability of leaders in battle and the high stakes involved in their protection.<p><b>but Jehoshaphat cried out</b><br>Jehoshaphat's cry can be seen as a plea for divine intervention, reflecting his reliance on God in times of distress. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where leaders called upon God for deliverance, such as King David in the Psalms. Jehoshaphat's cry may have also served to identify himself to the Arameans, clarifying that he was not Ahab. This act of calling out is a pivotal moment that leads to his preservation, contrasting with Ahab's fate and highlighting the theme of divine protection for those who seek God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who allied with Ahab, the king of Israel, to fight against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead.

According to some, it was his own name that he ejaculated, which is possible, if the command of ver. 31 was known in the allied army. According to others, it was the battle cry of Judah, which, it is said, would be familiar to the Syrians, and which would rally his own soldiers round him.

That it was a cry for Divine help is the most probable, because it is almost an instinct, especially with a pious soul like Jehoshaphat, to cry to God in the moment of danger. That he had doubts as to whether the course he was pursuing was pleasing to God, would make him all the more ready to cry aloud for mercy the moment he found himself in peril. But it may have been merely a cry of terror. It must be carefully observed that the Scripture does not say that it was this cry led to his being recognized and spared.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the chariot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1436;&#1499;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;re&#183;&#7733;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
