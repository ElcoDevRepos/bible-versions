In the context of <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11</a>, God is speaking to Jeroboam through the prophet Ahijah. Jeroboam, a servant of Solomon, is chosen by God to lead a portion of the divided kingdom. This divine intervention is reminiscent of God's calling of other leaders in Israel's history, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>). It underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders according to His purposes.<p><b>and you shall reign over all that your heart desires</b><br>This promise suggests that Jeroboam's reign will fulfill his ambitions and desires. It reflects the biblical principle that God often grants leadership to those whose hearts align with His purposes, though it also serves as a cautionary note about the potential for personal ambition to lead to downfall, as seen later in Jeroboam's reign (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). The phrase can be compared to God's promise to David, where God acknowledges the desires of a leader's heart (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p><b>and you will be king over Israel</b><br>This statement confirms Jeroboam's future role as king over the northern tribes of Israel. Historically, this marks the division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign, leading to the separate kingdoms of Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). Theologically, it highlights the consequences of Solomon's idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-13</a>). This division fulfills the prophecy given earlier in the chapter and sets the stage for the complex history of the divided kingdoms. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate reunification under a future king, seen as a type of Christ, who will reign over a united people of God (<a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>A servant of Solomon who is chosen by God to rule over ten tribes of Israel.
