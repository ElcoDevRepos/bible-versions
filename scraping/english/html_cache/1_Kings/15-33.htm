Asa was known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as detailed in <a href="/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9-15</a>. This period marks a time of division between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, following the split after Solomon's reign. Asa's reign is characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the idolatrous practices in Israel.<p><b>Baasha son of Ahijah</b><br>Baasha's lineage is mentioned to establish his identity and legitimacy as a ruler. He was from the tribe of Issachar, as noted in <a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>. His father, Ahijah, is not the same Ahijah the prophet who played a role in the division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). Baasha's rise to power involved the assassination of Nadab, Jeroboam's son, indicating a period of political instability and violence in Israel.<p><b>became king of all Israel</b><br>Baasha's ascension to the throne of Israel marks a continuation of the dynastic struggles that plagued the northern kingdom. His reign began with the extermination of Jeroboam's house, fulfilling the prophecy given by Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-14</a>). This act of usurpation reflects the turbulent nature of Israel's monarchy, where divine judgment and human ambition often intersected.<p><b>and he reigned in Tirzah</b><br>Tirzah served as the capital of the northern kingdom before Samaria was established by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). Archaeological evidence suggests Tirzah was a significant city during this period, with findings indicating its role as a political and administrative center. The choice of Tirzah as a capital reflects its strategic and economic importance in the region.<p><b>twenty-four years</b><br>Baasha's relatively long reign suggests a period of relative stability in Israel, despite the initial violence of his rise to power. His reign is marked by continued conflict with Judah, as well as internal challenges, including prophetic condemnation from Jehu son of Hanani (<a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>). The length of his reign indicates his ability to maintain control over Israel, though his dynasty would ultimately be short-lived, ending with his son Elah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry.
