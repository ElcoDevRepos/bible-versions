It was strategically located, making it a common site for battles. The fleeing of the Aramean army into Aphek signifies a retreat to a fortified location, hoping for protection. This reflects the common ancient practice of seeking refuge within city walls during times of defeat. The city of Aphek is mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>, where it is listed among the cities conquered by the Israelites, indicating its longstanding importance.<p><b>where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men</b><br>The collapse of the wall resulting in the death of twenty-seven thousand men is a dramatic demonstration of divine intervention. In ancient warfare, city walls were both a defense mechanism and a symbol of strength. The sudden fall of the wall suggests a supernatural event, reminiscent of the fall of Jericho's walls in <a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>. This event underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and power over human affairs, often using natural phenomena to achieve His purposes. The number twenty-seven thousand highlights the scale of the defeat and serves as a testament to the completeness of God's judgment against the Arameans.<p><b>Ben-hadad also fled to the city and hid in an inner room</b><br>Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, represents the leadership and pride of the Aramean forces. His flight and subsequent hiding in an inner room indicate a complete reversal of fortune and a loss of honor. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a king's retreat into hiding was a sign of utter defeat and humiliation. This act of seeking refuge in an inner room can be seen as a parallel to the human tendency to hide from God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8-10</a> with Adam and Eve.

The numbers in the text are very large, as in many other instances. It is possible (see Introduction) that there may be corruption, although the same numbers are found in the ancient versions. But the massing in small space of Oriental armies, and the extra ordinary slaughter consequent on it, are well illustrated in history; as, for instance, in the Greek wars with Persia or even our own experience in India.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the rest</span> [Plainly those not claim It cannot mean those not <span class="accented">defeated</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fled to Aphek</span> [It is clear that this fortress was then in the possession of the Syrians, as they took refuge within its walls], <span class="cmt_word">into the city; and there a wall</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> wall, <span class="accented">i.e., the</span> city wall] <span class="cmt_word">fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.</span> [The Hebrew implies that these were practically all who survived the battle, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is the word translated above, "the rest." We have here surely an exaggeration, even more obvious than that of ver. 39. For even if we suppose an earthquake, it is difficult to believe that the walls of a place like Aphek could bury so large a number in their ruins. Rawlinson suggests that the Syrians at the time were "manning the defences in full force," and that the earthquake "threw down the wall where they were most thickly crowded upon it;" but the question arises whether it is possible to mass 27,000 men upon any part of a wall, or all the walls, especially of an ancient village fortress. Thenius hints that the fall of the wall may have been occasioned by the Israelites undermining it during the night, but it seems hardly likely that so small a force could undertake operations of that kind against so formidable a body of troops. Keil objects to this view on another ground, viz., that its object is to negative the idea of a Divine interposition. But the text does not ascribe the fall of the wall to any such interposition, and we know that the sacred writers are not slow to recognize the finger of God whenever it is exerted.] And Ben-hadad fled, and came into [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span>] the city [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Aphek. Rawlinson interprets this statement to mean that he "fled from the wall, where he had been at the time of the disaster, into the inner parts of the city," but this is extremely doubtful. Observe the words, "fled <span class="accented">and cane to</span> the city" - words almost identical with those used of the fugitives above], <span class="cmt_word">into an inner chamber.</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">into a chamber within a</span> chamber, as in <a href="/1_kings/22-25.htm">1 Kings 22:25</a>. This cannot mean from chamber to chamber," as marg. It is to be observed that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> alone signifies properly an inner chamber. See <a href="/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>; <a href="/judges/16-9.htm">Judges 16:9, 12</a>. Rawlinson thinks that a <span class="accented">secret</span> chamber may be meant "a chamber in the wall, or one beneath the floor of another."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The rest of them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;
