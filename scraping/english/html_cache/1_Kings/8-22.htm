The altar of the LORD refers to the bronze altar in the temple courtyard, a central place for sacrifices and offerings to God. This act of standing before the altar signifies Solomon's role as both a political and spiritual leader. The altar's location in the newly constructed temple in Jerusalem highlights the city's significance as the religious center of Israel. This moment is a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>in front of the whole assembly of Israel</b><br>The assembly of Israel includes representatives from all the tribes, gathered for the dedication of the temple. This public setting underscores the communal nature of worship and the importance of national unity under God's covenant. The gathering of the assembly reflects the festivals and solemn assemblies commanded in the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). It also prefigures the unity of believers in Christ, as seen in the New Testament church (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>spread out his hands toward heaven</b><br>Spreading out hands is a gesture of prayer and supplication, symbolizing openness and a plea for divine intervention. This posture is common in biblical prayers, indicating humility and dependence on God (<a href="/psalms/28-2.htm">Psalm 28:2</a>). The direction toward heaven emphasizes the transcendence of God and His dwelling place above. Solomon's prayer that follows is a profound acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, echoing themes found in the Psalms and prophetic literature. This act foreshadows Christ's intercessory role, as He prays for His followers (<a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.

The scene opens with a deliberate action: &#8220;Then Solomon stood&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; His standing signals leadership and reverence, just as Joshua did when he gathered Israel at Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>) and as Ezra did when he read the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike sitting in royal comfort (<a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a>), the king rises to identify with the people before God, foreshadowing the greater Son of David who would likewise stand to intercede for His own (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>).<p>&#8226;
