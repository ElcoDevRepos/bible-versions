Solomon's rise to the throne was marked by political intrigue and family dynamics. The report signifies the importance of information and intelligence in maintaining power and order in the kingdom. In the context of ancient Israel, the king's court would have been a hub of activity where such reports were crucial for decision-making.<p><b>Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon:</b><br>Adonijah, Solomon's older brother, had previously declared himself king, attempting to usurp the throne. His fear of Solomon reflects the political tension and the potential for retribution common in royal successions of the time. This fear also underscores the legitimacy of Solomon's kingship, as recognized by both divine appointment and David's endorsement. The fear of a new king was typical in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where new rulers often eliminated rivals to secure their reign.<p><b>and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar:</b><br>The altar, located in the tabernacle, was a sacred place where sacrifices were made to God. The horns of the altar were considered a place of asylum, where individuals could seek refuge and mercy. This act by Adonijah is a plea for protection and a recognition of the altar's sanctity. It reflects the ancient practice of seeking sanctuary in holy places, a concept also seen in <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>, where the altar is a place of refuge for those seeking mercy.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.&#8217;</b><br>Adonijah's request for an oath from Solomon highlights the seriousness of his situation and his desire for assurance of safety. The phrase "put to the sword" is a common biblical expression for execution or death by violence. This plea for mercy is a recognition of Solomon's authority and a request for clemency. The use of "servant" indicates Adonijah's submission to Solomon's rule, acknowledging his position as a subject rather than a rival. This request for an oath is reminiscent of other biblical instances where oaths were used to secure peace and protection, such as the covenant between David and Jonathan in <a href="/1_samuel/20.htm">1 Samuel 20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempted to usurp the throne, fearing retribution from Solomon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, anointed as king, representing the legitimate continuation of David's dynasty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/horns_of_the_altar.htm">Horns of the Altar</a></b><br>A place of refuge in the tabernacle, symbolizing God's mercy and protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king whose succession plan is being challenged by Adonijah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events unfold, central to Israel's political and spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_mercy.htm">Seeking Mercy</a></b><br>Adonijah's act of holding the altar's horns symbolizes a plea for mercy.

God&#8217;s providence keeps Solomon informed just as He kept David informed in <a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The timing is crucial: Solomon hears about Adonijah right after taking the throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-38.htm">1 Kings 1:38-40</a>). The Lord often allows information to surface at just the moment a leader must act (<a href="/esther/6-1.htm">Esther 6:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the report underscores that nothing is hidden from the king God has established (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). Adonijah&#8217;s maneuvering is exposed, fulfilling the truth that the Lord &#8220;brings to light what is hidden in darkness&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon</b><p>&#8226; Only a short time earlier, Adonijah felt confident enough to declare himself king (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-10</a>). Now he is gripped by fear&#8212;a swift reversal reminiscent of Haman&#8217;s downfall in <a href="/esther/7-6.htm">Esther 7:6-8</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows that those who exalt themselves are humbled (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>). Adonijah&#8217;s sudden fear verifies <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>: &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His fear is not mere anxiety; it is the recognition that lawful authority now rests with Solomon (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has taken hold of the horns of the altar</b><p>&#8226; The altar&#8217;s horns (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-2</a>) were regarded as a place of refuge; innocent blood was never to be shed there (<a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13-14</a>). Grasping them was a physical plea for mercy, a custom also seen when Joab later does the same (<a href="/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Adonijah&#8217;s action acknowledges the holiness of the sanctuary and, implicitly, the God who ordained it. Even a schemer recognizes the shelter God provides (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this refuge was never meant to protect the guilty from justice. Solomon will soon make that distinction clear (<a href="/1_kings/1-53.htm">1 Kings 1:53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Adonijah&#8217;s words reveal his new posture: he calls himself Solomon&#8217;s &#8220;servant.&#8221; The proud prince now seeks clemency, echoing the prodigal son&#8217;s plea in <a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18-19</a>.<p>&#8226; By asking for an oath, he seeks the security of a public, binding promise (<a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23-24</a>). He trusts Solomon&#8217;s integrity more than his own safety at the altar.<p>&#8226; Solomon will grant conditional mercy (<a href="/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52-53</a>), mirroring David&#8217;s earlier mercy toward Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4-7</a>). Mercy reigns, yet justice remains ready should rebellion reappear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/1-51.htm">1 Kings 1:51</a> records the dramatic shift from Adonijah&#8217;s self-exaltation to his desperate quest for mercy. The report to Solomon, Adonijah&#8217;s fear, his grasp on the altar&#8217;s horns, and his request for an oath all highlight three timeless truths: God swiftly humbles the proud, true authority rests with the one He appoints, and genuine refuge is found only when a sinner acknowledges both God&#8217;s holiness and the king&#8217;s right to rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold Adonijah feareth King Solomon, for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, let king Solomon</span> [this repetition of the title is striking. Both courtiers and criminals hasten to give the young king his new honours. In Adonijah's mouth it is also a virtual abdication of his claim to the throne and a direct acknowledgment of the new monarch. But see on vers. 1 and 35.] <span class="cmt_word">swear unto me today</span> [Cf. <a href="/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>. This is one of many passages which show how lightly the Jews esteemed promises in comparison with oaths. The sentiment possibly took its rise in the oaths sworn by the Divine Being (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>, etc.), though it is possible, on the other hand, that these asseverations were made in deference to the popular sentiment. Be that as it may, the oath held a much more conspicuous and important place in the Jewish than the Christian economy.
