This age suggests a level of maturity and experience, as he had likely been involved in the affairs of the kingdom during his father's reign. His age at ascension is significant because it indicates he was not a young, inexperienced ruler, which may have contributed to his ability to implement religious reforms and strengthen the kingdom. The age of thirty-five also aligns with the biblical pattern of leaders who often began their significant roles in their thirties, such as David and Jesus Christ, who began His public ministry around the age of thirty.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years</b><br>Jehoshaphat's reign in Jerusalem lasted for twenty-five years, a relatively long period that allowed him to establish stability and implement significant reforms. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was the political and spiritual center of the kingdom, housing the Temple built by Solomon. Jehoshaphat's reign is noted for his efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh, contrasting with the idolatry that plagued the northern kingdom of Israel. His reign is marked by peace and prosperity, as well as alliances with the northern kingdom, which were both beneficial and problematic.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi</b><br>The mention of Jehoshaphat's mother, Azubah, daughter of Shilhi, highlights the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative. While not much is known about Azubah, her inclusion in the text underscores the role of women in the royal lineage and the influence they may have had on their sons. In the context of the kings of Judah, the mention of the queen mother often indicates her status and potential influence in the court. This detail also serves to authenticate the historical record, providing a genealogical anchor for Jehoshaphat's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at the age of thirty-five and ruled for twenty-five years.
