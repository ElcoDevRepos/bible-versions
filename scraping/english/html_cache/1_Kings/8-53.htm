The use of "O Lord GOD" reflects the Hebrew names "Yahweh" and "Elohim," emphasizing both the covenantal and powerful aspects of God. This invocation is consistent with the reverence shown throughout the Old Testament, where God is recognized as the supreme ruler and creator.<p><b>have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth</b><br>This highlights the concept of Israel's election and sanctification. God chose Israel to be a holy nation, distinct from other nations. This idea is rooted in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, where Israel is described as a "holy people" chosen by God. The setting apart signifies a special relationship and purpose, which includes being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><b>as Your inheritance,</b><br>The term "inheritance" signifies possession and value. In the ancient Near Eastern context, an inheritance was a treasured possession passed down through generations. Israel as God's inheritance implies a deep, enduring relationship. This concept is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>, where the Lord's portion is His people, Jacob His allotted inheritance.<p><b>as You spoke through Your servant Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promises and the authority of Moses as a prophet. Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, through whom God delivered the Law and established the covenant. References to Moses' role can be found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God promises to make Israel a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<p><b>when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.</b><br>This recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. The Exodus is frequently referenced throughout Scripture as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness (Exodus 12-14). It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the Passover Lamb (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>), providing spiritual liberation from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who is offering a prayer of dedication for the newly built temple in Jerusalem.

This verse highlights their unique covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of God through whom God declared His promises to Israel. Moses is a central figure in the history of Israel, representing the law and the covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and God's power to save His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The physical representation of God's presence among His people, where Solomon is dedicating this prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as seen in His relationship with Israel.
