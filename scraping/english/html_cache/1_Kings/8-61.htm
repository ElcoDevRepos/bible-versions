In the context of <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, Solomon is dedicating the temple, a significant event in Israel's history. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Full devotion implies a complete commitment without reservation. This call to devotion echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. It also prefigures Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>, where He reiterates the greatest commandment to love God fully.<p><b>as it is this day,</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the current state of the people's hearts during the temple dedication. It suggests a moment of spiritual renewal and commitment, similar to other covenant renewals in Israel's history, such as Joshua's covenant at Shechem (Joshua 24). The phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining this devotion beyond the present moment, as Israel's history shows a pattern of initial faithfulness followed by periods of apostasy.<p><b>to walk in His statutes</b><br>Walking in God's statutes implies living a life in accordance with His laws and decrees. The metaphor of walking suggests a continuous, active lifestyle rather than a one-time act. This concept is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's laws was a condition of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The statutes refer to specific laws given to Israel, which are detailed in the Torah. This call to obedience is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live by the Spirit and follow Christ's teachings (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><b>and to keep His commandments.</b><br>Keeping God's commandments involves not only knowing them but also actively observing and practicing them. This phrase reinforces the idea of obedience as a demonstration of devotion to God. The commandments include the Ten Commandments and other moral, ceremonial, and civil laws given to Israel. In the New Testament, Jesus summarizes the commandments into two: love for God and love for neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>). This continuity highlights the enduring nature of God's moral law and the expectation of obedience as a response to God's covenantal love and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who led the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem.

He maintains, indeed, that the chronicler contradicts himself, for we can hardly think that the glory which we are told (<a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>) had already filled the house, left it and then returned. It is certainly suspicious, and a much stronger argument against the words in question, that no mention of the fire is made by our author, for, brief as this history is, it is difficult to believe that so signal an interposition could have remained unnoticed, if it really occurred. <span class="cmt_word">SECTION IV.</span> - <span class="accented">The Festal Sacrifices</span>. The ceremonial of dedication was followed, as would naturally be the case, by sacrifices on a scale of unusual grandeur. Apart from their religious use and significance, the sacrifices testified to the devotion of the giver who on this of all days must not appear before the Lord empty, and they also afforded materials for the great and prolonged feast by which this auspicious event in the history of Israel must be commemorated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/8-61.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So let your heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#7687;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
