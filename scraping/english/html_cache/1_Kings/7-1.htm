Solomon's focus shifts from the house of God to his own residence. This transition highlights the dual responsibilities of Solomon as both a king and a servant of God. The "however" suggests a change in priority or emphasis, reflecting the human tendency to balance personal and divine obligations.<p><b>took thirteen years</b><br>The duration of thirteen years indicates the significant time and resources invested in building Solomon's palace. This period is notably longer than the seven years it took to build the temple, suggesting the grandeur and complexity of the palace. The number thirteen, while not symbolically significant in the Bible, underscores the extensive nature of the project. This timeframe also reflects the prosperity and stability of Solomon's reign, allowing for such an ambitious undertaking.<p><b>to complete the construction</b><br>The completion of the construction signifies the fulfillment of Solomon's plans and the realization of his vision for a royal residence. This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness and dedication required to finish such a large-scale project. It also reflects the wisdom and organizational skills attributed to Solomon, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as his administrative abilities in <a href="/1_kings/4.htm">1 Kings 4</a>.<p><b>of his entire palace.</b><br>The palace complex was not just a single building but a series of structures, including the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Hall of Pillars, the Hall of the Throne, and Solomon's own residence. This complex served various functions, from administrative to residential, and was a symbol of Solomon's wealth and power. The palace's grandeur is a testament to the peace and prosperity during Solomon's reign, as well as his desire to establish a lasting legacy. The palace's construction can be seen as a type of Christ's future kingdom, where He will reign in glory and majesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem and his own palace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_palace.htm">Solomon's Palace</a></b><br>A grand construction project that took thirteen years to complete, reflecting Solomon's wealth and the prosperity of Israel during his reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Solomon's palace and the Temple were located, serving as the political and spiritual center of the nation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_god's_work.htm">Prioritizing God's Work</a></b><br>Solomon spent seven years building the Temple and thirteen years on his palace.

The author signals a shift from sacred to royal construction.<p>&#8226; The temple came first (<a href="/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>), underlining proper priorities&#8212;God&#8217;s house before the king&#8217;s. Only after the temple&#8217;s completion does the narrative turn to Solomon&#8217;s residence, showing that worship precedes personal comfort (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>took thirteen years</b><p>&#8226; Thirteen years is nearly double the time spent on the temple. The span underscores the scale and complexity of the palace complex described in <a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-12</a>.<p>&#8226; This length also displays Solomon&#8217;s patience and thoroughness. He did not rush God&#8217;s work nor his own, reflecting the principle that great undertakings often require extended faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/6-12.htm">Hebrews 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_chronicles/8-1.htm">2 Chronicles 8:1</a>, after these twenty years&#8212;seven plus thirteen&#8212;Solomon finally turns to fortifying other cities, indicating how the palace phase dominated a long season of his reign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to complete</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;To complete&#8221; shows the project reached full termination, echoing the temple&#8217;s completion language (<a href="/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14, 38</a>). God delights in finished tasks (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s commitment to completion models how believers are to finish what they start, mirroring the Lord who perfects what He begins (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse defends the palace&#8217;s legitimacy: the same king who finished God&#8217;s house also fully saw through the royal residence. The narrative records no divine rebuke for the palace project itself, affirming its appropriateness when kept in right order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the construction of</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Construction&#8221; points to the physical, tangible building efforts: timber from Lebanon, costly stones, artisans (<a href="/1_kings/7-10.htm">1 Kings 7:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Wise planning, resources provisioned by Hiram (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6-9</a>), and labor divisions (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>) all converge here.

The verse highlights (1) the king responsible, (2) the deliberate contrast with the temple&#8217;s earlier completion, (3) the extended timeframe revealing magnitude and diligence, (4) the importance of finishing what one begins, (5) the careful construction process, and (6) the comprehensive scope of the royal residence. Together these points affirm God&#8217;s orderly priority&#8212;worship first, then work&#8212;and showcase Solomon&#8217;s faithfulness to see his God-given tasks through to the end.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years</span> [There is no contrast implied between the time spent upon the temple and that occupied in the building of the palace, as the word "but" seems to suggest. The close connexion which exists in the original is interrupted by the division of chapters. In <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> we read, "So was he seven years in building it." <a href="/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> then proceeds, "And he was building his own house thirteen years." The much longer period occupied in the erection of the royal palace is easily accounted for. In the first place, the buildings were much larger, and the undertaking altogether was a much more extensive one (ver. 2). Then, though seven years only were consumed in the actual building of the temple, yet preparations for the work had been made, both by David and Solomon, for a long time beforehand. Lastly, a special force of labourers would appear to have been employed on the temple, while it is probable that they wrought at the palaces in greatly diminished numbers. So that the longer period spent over his own house does not argue selfishness or worldliness on Solomon's part. On the contrary, it speaks well for his piety that he built the temple first and urged on that sacred work with so much vigour. The thirteen years date from the completion of the seven years of <a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>. That is to say, the building of the temple and palace together occupied twenty years, as is expressly stated in <a href="/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>. It is therefore one of Stanley's reckless statements that the palace "was commenced at the same time as the temple, but not finished till eight years afterwards"], <span class="cmt_word">and he finished all his house.</span> [By Solomon's "house" we are not to understand his private palace, or residence proper, alone (see ver. 8), but a range of palaces, more or less connected including the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (ver. 2), "the porch of pillars" (ver. 6), the throne-room or judgment hall (ver. 7), his own house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (ver. 8). That all these are comprehended under the term "house" is evident from <a href="/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 10, 15</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, where Solomon's buildings are always spoken of as <span class="accented">two</span>, viz., "the house of the Lord" and the "king's house." The situation of this string of palaces is by no means certain. Josephus says it stood over against (or opposite) the temple, which is highly probable; but this still leaves the question of site open, for the palace would be justly described as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it stood west or south of the sanctuary. Ewald places it on the opposite ridge of Ophel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the south prolongation of the temple mount; while Fergusson, Bahr, etc., locate it on the northeast side of Zion, on the opposite side of the Tyropoean valley, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. Recent explorations seem to favour Ewald's view. See "Recovery of Jerusalem," pp. 319 sqq, and "Our Work in Palestine," p. 159 sqq. When we remember that the very site of <span class="accented">Zion</span> is disputed, it will not surprise the reader that questions of this kind should be involved in uncertainty. And when it is further considered that the accumulated <span class="accented">debris</span> of Jerusalem at one point reaches a depth of 120 feet, it will be readily understood what obstacles stand in the way of their settlement.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Solomon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
