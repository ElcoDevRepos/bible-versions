The use of three rows suggests a focus on symmetry and balance, which were important in ancient Near Eastern architecture. High windows would allow for ample light and ventilation, crucial in the hot climate of Israel. This design choice may also symbolize the divine light and wisdom that Solomon was known for, as light often represents God's presence in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><b>facing one another</b><br>The phrase indicates a deliberate architectural plan, where the windows were aligned to face each other, possibly to maximize light and airflow. This alignment could also symbolize harmony and order, reflecting the peace and prosperity of Solomon's reign. In a spiritual sense, it may suggest the idea of mutual reflection and accountability, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>, "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."<p><b>in three tiers</b><br>The use of three tiers in the construction is significant, as the number three often holds symbolic meaning in the Bible, representing completeness and divine perfection. This could be seen as a reflection of God's perfect order and the completeness of His creation. The tiered structure might also be a precursor to later architectural developments, such as the tiered design of the Second Temple. Additionally, the number three is frequently associated with the Trinity in Christian theology, hinting at the divine nature of wisdom and order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the construction of the temple and his palace, demonstrating his wisdom and wealth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_palace_of_the_forest_of_lebanon.htm">The Palace of the Forest of Lebanon</a></b><br>A significant structure built by Solomon, known for its grandeur and intricate design, including the windows mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/windows_with_beveled_frames.htm">Windows with Beveled Frames</a></b><br>Architectural features that highlight the sophistication and attention to detail in Solomon's building projects.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_god's_work.htm">Attention to Detail in God's Work</a></b><br>Just as Solomon paid attention to the details in his construction projects, we should be diligent and meticulous in our service to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wisdom.htm">The Importance of Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's ability to build such magnificent structures was a result of the wisdom God granted him.
