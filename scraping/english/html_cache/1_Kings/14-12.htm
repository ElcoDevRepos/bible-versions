The directive to "get up and go home" signifies urgency and a divine mandate. In the biblical context, prophets often delivered messages that required immediate action, reflecting the seriousness of God's word. The journey back home is not just physical but also symbolic of returning to face the consequences of Jeroboam's actions. The phrase "get up" is reminiscent of other biblical calls to action, such as God's command to Abraham to leave his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>) or Jonah's call to go to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>). It underscores the necessity of obedience to God's instructions.<p><b>When your feet enter the city,</b><br>The city referred to is likely Tirzah, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel at the time. Tirzah was an important city, known for its beauty and strategic location. The mention of "your feet entering the city" highlights the immediacy and certainty of the prophecy. In biblical narratives, the act of entering a city often marks a significant transition or fulfillment of a divine promise or judgment. This phrase also emphasizes the personal involvement of Jeroboam's wife in the unfolding events, as her actions are directly linked to the prophecy's fulfillment.<p><b>the child will die.</b><br>This tragic outcome is a direct consequence of Jeroboam's disobedience and idolatry. The child, Abijah, is the son of Jeroboam, and his death serves as a sign of God's judgment against Jeroboam's house. In the broader biblical context, the death of a child as a form of divine judgment is seen in other instances, such as the death of David and Bathsheba's first son (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>). Theologically, this reflects the seriousness of sin and the impact of a leader's actions on their family and nation. The child's death also serves as a poignant reminder of the cost of turning away from God, and it foreshadows the eventual downfall of Jeroboam's dynasty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahijah_the_prophet.htm">Ahijah the Prophet</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord who delivers God's message to Jeroboam's wife.

Although she tried to disguise herself (<a href="/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2</a>), the Lord exposed the ruse, underscoring His omniscience much like He did with Nathan confronting David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>.<p>&#8226; By isolating her with the phrase &#8220;As for you,&#8221; God distinguishes between the individual listener and the broader judgment falling on Jeroboam&#8217;s dynasty (<a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The address reminds us that every person must reckon with God&#8217;s word individually&#8212;echoing Joshua&#8217;s &#8220;as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>get up and go home</b><p>&#8226; The instruction is simple and immediate. No further dialogue is invited; the decision is now to obey. Compare the abrupt dismissal of Saul by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>&#8212;when rebellion has been exposed, lingering serves no purpose.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Go home&#8221; sends her back to the epicenter of sin&#8217;s consequences. Just as the prodigal son &#8220;got up and went to his father&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), returning home often means facing reality.<p>&#8226; The command also spares Ahijah from accompanying her, paralleling God&#8217;s insistence on separating the righteous messenger from impending judgment (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15&#8211;17</a> with Lot).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When your feet enter the city</b><p>&#8226; God pinpoints the timing of the sign. Precision authenticates prophecy; see the withered altar sign in <a href="/1_kings/13-3.htm">1 Kings 13:3&#8211;5</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights God&#8217;s sovereignty over time and space&#8212;He measures a moment down to footsteps, just as He marked the priests&#8217; first step into the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a>) and Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy of Hananiah&#8217;s death &#8220;in the seventh month&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/28-17.htm">Jeremiah 28:17</a>).<p>&#8226; It serves as a solemn march: each step toward Tirzah counts down to judgment. The certainty grants no room for negotiation or delay, recalling <a href="/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>&#8217;s &#8220;fearful expectation of judgment.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the child will die</b><p>&#8226; Abijah&#8217;s death is both judicial and merciful. Judicial&#8212;because it signals the beginning of the end for Jeroboam&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>). Merciful&#8212;because Abijah alone &#8220;had something good found in him&#8221; and would be the only one buried honorably (<a href="/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern mirrors David&#8217;s unnamed son who died for David&#8217;s sin (<a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>), showing that sin&#8217;s wages are death even when forgiveness is available.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s action defends His holiness: He will not allow the corruption of Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry to continue unchecked (<a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>). At the same time, He gathers Abijah, sparing the boy from witnessing the violent extermination soon to descend (<a href="/1_kings/14-14.htm">1 Kings 14:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers, the scene foreshadows a later righteous Son whose death would also serve both judgment and mercy (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>)&#8212;though in Christ, death is followed by resurrection, offering hope beyond the grave.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/14-12.htm">1 Kings 14:12</a> delivers a personal, time-stamped, and irrevocable verdict: Jeroboam&#8217;s wife must return home, and the moment she crosses the city threshold, her son will die. Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s omniscience, the necessity of immediate obedience, the precision of divine prophecy, and the sobering reality that sin brings death. Yet even within judgment, God shows mercy by removing Abijah from greater calamity and giving Israel an unmistakable sign that the LORD alone rules kings and kingdoms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">then</span> the child.
