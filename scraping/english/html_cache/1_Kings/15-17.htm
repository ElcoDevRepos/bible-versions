His reign is marked by conflict with the southern kingdom of Judah, which was ruled by Asa at the time. This period of history is characterized by frequent hostilities between the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, reflecting the political and religious tensions that arose after the united monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon. The division of the kingdom occurred due to Solomon's idolatry and the subsequent judgment of God, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>. Baasha's aggression against Judah can be seen as part of the ongoing struggle for dominance and control over the region.<p><b>and fortified Ramah</b><br>Ramah was a strategically important town located about five miles north of Jerusalem. Its location made it a key military and trade route, and controlling it would allow Baasha to exert pressure on Judah. Fortifying Ramah was a tactical move to strengthen Israel's position and to challenge Asa's rule. Archaeological evidence suggests that Ramah was indeed a significant site during this period, and its fortification would have been a considerable undertaking, indicating Baasha's determination to assert his power.<p><b>to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah</b><br>By fortifying Ramah, Baasha aimed to cut off Judah's access to the northern kingdom and to control the movement of people and goods. This blockade would have had significant economic and social implications for Judah, potentially leading to shortages and unrest. Asa's response to this threat is detailed in the subsequent verses, where he seeks assistance from Ben-Hadad, king of Aram, to counter Baasha's aggression. This action reflects the complex political alliances and rivalries of the time. The blockade also highlights the broader theme of reliance on God versus reliance on human alliances, a recurring issue in the history of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>King of Israel who reigned after Jeroboam.

The text, however, implies a further design to blockade the road between the kingdoms, perhaps explained by the statement, in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9-10</a>, of the falling away of many from Israel to Asa, now in the height of his prosperity.

It was not merely to have an advanced post as a menace to Jerusalem (Rawlinson), but primarily, by its command of the high road, to prevent his subjects from falling away to the kingdom of Judah, or even from going up to Jerusalem to worship; in fact, to isolate Judah and to blockade its capital. That there was a great defection to Ass at this time we know from <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>. This was an exodus which Baasha felt must be checked. Blunt ("Coincidences," pp. 176-8) has happily shown from <a href="/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a>, etc., how the primary object must have been to "stop the alarming drainage of all that was virtuous out of their borders." Rawlinson sees in the fortification of this place "the first step towards a conquest of the southern kingdom."
