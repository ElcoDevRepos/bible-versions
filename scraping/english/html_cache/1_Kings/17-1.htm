"Tishbite" likely refers to his origin from Tishbe, a town in Gilead. Elijah's name means "My God is Yahweh," reflecting his mission to confront idolatry in Israel. His role as a prophet is pivotal, marking a period of intense spiritual conflict.<p><b>who was among the settlers of Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a rugged, mountainous region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land. The settlers of Gilead were often seen as hardy and independent, which may have influenced Elijah's character. This area was part of the tribal inheritance of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, known for their warrior spirit.<p><b>said to Ahab</b><br>Ahab was the seventh king of Israel, notorious for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into Baal worship. Elijah's confrontation with Ahab sets the stage for a series of divine judgments against the king's apostasy. This encounter highlights the tension between the worship of Yahweh and Baal.<p><b>As surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives</b><br>This declaration affirms the existence and sovereignty of Yahweh, contrasting with the lifeless idols of Baal. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding Ahab of the true God who is active and living. This phrase is a common prophetic formula, asserting the certainty of God's word.<p><b>before whom I stand</b><br>Elijah's statement indicates his role as a servant and messenger of God, standing in His presence. This phrase implies a position of authority and accountability, as seen in other biblical figures like Moses and Joshua. It reflects the intimate relationship between the prophet and God, emphasizing Elijah's divine commission.<p><b>there will be neither dew nor rain in these years</b><br>The withholding of rain is a direct challenge to Baal, the Canaanite storm god, believed to control fertility and weather. This drought is a divine judgment on Israel for their idolatry, fulfilling the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16-17</a>. It demonstrates God's power over nature and false gods, reinforcing His supremacy.<p><b>except at my word!</b><br>Elijah's authority to declare the drought highlights the power of prophetic word and God's backing of His prophets. This phrase underscores the role of the prophet as God's mouthpiece, whose words carry divine authority. It foreshadows the eventual end of the drought at Elijah's command, showcasing God's mercy and the power of repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_tishbite.htm">Elijah the Tishbite</a></b><br>A prophet of God from Tishbe in Gilead, known for his boldness and faithfulness to God.

The verse sets the stage for a showdown between the real God who rules the skies and the powerless idols Israel has embraced, reminding every generation that fidelity to the living God determines blessing or barrenness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants of Gilead.</span>--The most probable rendering of this disputed passage is that of the LXX., and virtually of Josephus, "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead," the last words being added to distinguish the place from a Tishbe (or Thisbe) in Naphtali, referred to, though the reading is rather doubtful, in <a href="//apocrypha.org/tobit/1-2.htm" title="Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was led captive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.">Tobit 1:2</a>. The word here rendered "inhabitants" (properly "sojourners") is evidently of the same derivation as the word rendered "Tishbite." The only alternative would be to render "the stranger of the strangers of Gilead," which has been adopted by some, as suggesting a startling and impressive origin of the great prophet. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear it.<span class= "bld"><p>Gilead</span>--properly "the rocky region" that lay on the east of Jordan, between the Hieromax and the valley of Heshbon (although the name is often more widely used). Open to the desert on the east, and itself comparatively wild, with but few cities scattered through it, it suited well the recluse dweller in the wilderness.<span class= "bld"><p>The Lord God of Israel before whom I stand.</span>--This adjuration (repeated in 18:15, and with some alteration by Elisha in <a href="/2_kings/3-14.htm" title="And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.">2Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm" title="But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.">2Kings 5:16</a>) is characteristic. Elijah is the servant of God standing to be sent whither He wills.<p>This is evidently not the first appearance of Elijah. In <a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>, the withholding of rain, foretold again and again as a penalty on apostasy (see <a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm" title="And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:">Leviticus 26:19</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm" title="And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you.">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>; and comp. <a href="/1_kings/8-35.htm" title="When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:">1Kings 8:35</a>), is noted as an answer to the prophet's prayer, calling down judgment on the land. Evidently there had been a struggle against the Baal-worship of the time, and, no doubt, previous warnings from Elijah or from some one of the murdered prophets. This chapter introduces us suddenly to the catastrophe.<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elijah</span> [This name, which appears both as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, and, less frequently, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, means <span class="accented">my God is Jehovah</span>. It is so singularly appropriate to the man who bore it, and so exactly expresses the idea of his life and the chapter of his work (see especially <a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>), that it is difficult to resist the belief that it was assumed by him. This is certainly more probable than that it was due to the prescience of his parents. It may, however, mark their piety and hopes, and may have influenced the life of their son.

But it is by no certain that the current interpretaioni not the best. Such a play upon words as it involves is not at all uncommon in Hebrew. The meaning would then be that Elijah , who was, if not by birth, by domicile, of Tishbe, was one of the strangers - <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;</span> is found in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">inquilinus</span>, in <a href="/genesis/23-4.htm">Genesis 23:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-45.htm">Exodus 12:45</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 47</a>, etc. - or immigrants who had settled in Gilead. The only objection to this rendering - apart from the identity of radicals just <span class="accented">mentioned -</span> is that we should have expected to find <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> written <span class="accented">plene</span>, as the word always is elsewhere. It is alleged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span>, however, that the <span class="accented">stat</span>. <span class="accented">constr</span>. <span class="accented">plur</span>. may well be an exception to the rule, and in support of this view it may be mentioned that the cognate word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, is constantly found in the <span class="accented">constr, plural</span> as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see Gesen., Thessalonians 635). It is clear, then, that the usual <span class="accented">interpretation is</span> by no <span class="accented">means</span> to be lightly set aside. It is certainly preferable to the rendering, "Elijah the stranger," etc., for we have no proof that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can bear this meaning. In favour of the alternative rendering "the Tishbite of Tishbe," it may be said that it has the support of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and of Josephus (Ant. 8:13. 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Nor is it any weighty objection to this view that we now here read of a Tishbe in Gilead: as for the matter of that, we have no undoubted traces of any such place <span class="accented">west</span> of the Jordan; the passage in Tobit (ch. 1:2, LXX.), which is often alleged as proving that there was a Tishbe in Galilee, and from which Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, etc., <span class="accented">conclude</span> that this must be the Tishbi here referred to, being too uncertain to permit us to build any positive conclusions thereupon. See Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1489, 1516. In any case - and it is <span class="accented">perhaps impossible</span> to decide positively between this and the rendering of the A.V. - it is clear that Elijah, even if born in Galilee (but see <a href="/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>, for the belief of the Jews), was trained for his work in Gilead. It was, <span class="accented">therefore</span>, a rugged, unsettled, half-civilized, trans-Jordanic region gave to the world the greatest of its prophets. In this respect he was like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), and his antitype the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a>). "The fact that this <span class="accented">mission</span> was entrusted not to a dweller in royal city or prophetic school, but to a genuine child of the deserts and forests of Gilead, is in exact accordance with the dispensations of Providence in other times" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">said unto Ahab</span> [The abrupt way in which Elijah appears upon the scene without a word of introduction or explanation is certainly remarkable. Ewald observes that "his first entry within the <span class="accented">province</span> of the history seems almost as unique and inexplicable as his final disappearance." "Elijah comes in with a <span class="accented">tempest</span>, and goes out with a whirlwind" (Hall). But there is no sufficient ground for believing (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that a part of our history which described some of his antecedents has been lost to us, or that our text merely recites the <span class="accented">issue</span> of a long conference which Elijah had held with Ahab, for other prophets of this period, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Jehu, are introduced to us in a similar manner, though it must be allowed that their respective ministries were of very different proportions and importance from Elijah's. This sudden appearance, however, is thoroughly characteristic of the man. He presently disappears just as suddenly (ver. 5. Cf. 19:3; <a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>). It was thought by some in that age that he was borne hither and thither by the Spirit of God! <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>), and men of a later time caught this as one of his prominent characteristics (Ecclus. 48:1-12). Hence, too, the traditions of a still later period, according to which he was "the fiery Phinehas returned to earth, or an angel hovering on the outskirts of the world," Stanley], <span class="cmt_word">As the Lord God of Israel liveth</span> [This formula here occurs for the first time, and it is full of meaning. It asserts first that Jehovah, not Baal, is the God of Israel, and it suggests, in the second place, that he is the <span class="accented">living</span> God, such as Baal was not, and that though ordinarily He keeps silence, He is one who can make His power felt], <span class="cmt_word">before whom I stand</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Whose I am and whom I serve" (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>). Cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-15.htm">1 Kings 18:15</a>. The slaves of the East stood before their masters. See note on 1 Kings 1:28, and cf. <a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>. Elijah claims to speak in God's name, and as His ambassador], <span class="cmt_word">there shall not be dew nor rain</span> [Observe the order of the words. Dew is perhaps put first as more essential to vegetable life. Elijah only denounces a plague already threatened in the law as the punishment of idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16, 17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>). He came forward as the vindicator and restorer of the law] <span class="cmt_word">these years</span> [An indefinite period. Its duration depended on Elijah's word, and that again on the penitence, etc., of the people. It was because of the obduracy of king and people that it lasted so long] <span class="cmt_word">but according to my word.</span> [The idolatrous priests no doubt claimed for Baal the dominion over nature and absolute control over the clouds and rain - a power which, it may be worth observing, the monks of the convent of St. Katherine at Sinai, where Elijah was, are thought to possess by the Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula. Elijah directly challenges them to a trial of strength. It was as if he had said, "The God that answereth by rain, let him be God." On the fitness of this miracle, both as a sign and as a punishment, see "Homil. Quart." 5:100,101. "To Eastern and Southern nations, where life and water go always together, where vegetation gathers round the slightest particle of moisture and dies the moment it is withdrawn...the withholding of rain is the withholding of pleasure, of sustenance, of life itself " (Stanley). "My word" is somewhat emphatic, "<span class="accented">Nisi ego, et non alius vir</span>... <span class="accented">dixero</span> " (Seb. Schmidt). No doubt there is a special reference to the prophets of Baal. Their inability to remove the ban would prove the impotency of their god.
