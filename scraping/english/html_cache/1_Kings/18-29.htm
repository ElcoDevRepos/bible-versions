The event took place around noon, a time when the sun was at its peak, symbolizing the height of Baal's supposed power as a sun god. The delay highlights the futility of the prophets' efforts and sets the stage for God's power to be demonstrated later.<p><b>and they kept on raving</b><br>The prophets of Baal engaged in frenzied, ecstatic rituals, which were common in ancient Near Eastern religious practices. This behavior was intended to invoke the attention of their deity through self-mutilation and loud cries. The term "raving" suggests a lack of control and desperation, contrasting with the calm and orderly worship of the God of Israel.<p><b>until the time of the evening sacrifice</b><br>The evening sacrifice was a significant part of Israelite worship, occurring around 3 PM. This timing underscores the contrast between the ineffective rituals of Baal's prophets and the orderly worship of Yahweh. The evening sacrifice was a daily offering, symbolizing the people's continual devotion to God and foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<p><b>But there was no response</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the impotence of Baal, a false god unable to answer or act. It highlights the biblical theme of the futility of idolatry, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describes idols as having mouths but not speaking.<p><b>no one answered</b><br>The repetition underscores the silence and absence of Baal, reinforcing the idea that idols are powerless. This silence contrasts with the living God, who actively communicates with His people, as seen throughout the Bible.<p><b>no one paid attention</b><br>This final phrase underscores the complete failure of the prophets' efforts. It serves as a powerful reminder of the sovereignty and exclusivity of the God of Israel, who alone is worthy of worship and capable of responding to His people's needs. This moment foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's power through Jesus Christ, who is the true mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Lord, Elijah is central to this account as he challenges the prophets of Baal to demonstrate the power of their god versus the power of Yahweh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>These were the prophets serving the Canaanite god Baal, who were challenged by Elijah to call upon their god to send fire from heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location where the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal took place.
