In the biblical context, God often "gives over" nations or peoples as a form of judgment for their disobedience. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and protection are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The concept of God giving over a nation is seen elsewhere, such as in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God gives people over to their sinful desires as a form of judgment.<p><b>on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division, is notorious for leading Israel into idolatry. He established golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem to worship, which was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This act of idolatry set a precedent for future kings and led to a pattern of sin that plagued Israel. Jeroboam's actions are frequently referenced as the standard of sinfulness for subsequent kings (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>).<p><b>and has caused Israel to commit.</b><br>Jeroboam's influence extended beyond his personal sin; he led the entire nation into idolatry. This highlights the responsibility of leaders and the impact of their actions on their followers. The sin of leading others astray is a serious offense in Scripture (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>). The phrase underscores the communal aspect of sin in Israel, where the king's actions had national consequences. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the fate of the nation is often tied to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of its leaders (<a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
