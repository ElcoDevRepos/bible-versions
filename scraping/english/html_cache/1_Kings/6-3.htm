In ancient Near Eastern architecture, such structures were common, providing a grand entrance to significant buildings. The temple's portico reflects the importance of the temple as the dwelling place of God among His people. This entrance can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "door" (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>) through which believers enter into the presence of God.<p><b>was twenty cubits long</b><br>A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making the portico approximately 30 feet long. This measurement indicates the grandeur and scale of Solomon's Temple, emphasizing its importance and the resources dedicated to its construction. The number twenty in biblical numerology can symbolize a period of waiting or completeness, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>extending across the width of the temple</b><br>The portico's extension across the entire width of the temple signifies its role as an integral part of the structure, not merely an addition. This design choice highlights the unity and completeness of the temple, mirroring the unity of God's covenant with Israel. The temple itself is a foreshadowing of the body of Christ, the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>and projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple</b><br>The projection of ten cubits, or about 15 feet, indicates the portico's prominence and its function as a welcoming space. The number ten often represents completeness or divine order in the Bible, as seen in the Ten Commandments. This projection can symbolize the outreach of God's presence to His people, inviting them into worship and relationship. The temple, as a whole, prefigures the ultimate reconciliation between God and humanity through Jesus Christ, who extends His grace to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.
