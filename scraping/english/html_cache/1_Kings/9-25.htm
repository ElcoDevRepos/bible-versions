These festivals were times when all Israelite males were required to appear before the Lord at the place He would choose, which was eventually the temple in Jerusalem. This practice is rooted in the Mosaic Law, specifically in <a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>.<p><b>Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings (olah) were sacrifices that were completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God. Peace offerings (shelamim) were sacrifices that expressed gratitude and fellowship with God, often shared between the offerer, the priests, and God. Solomon's participation in these offerings highlights his role not only as king but also as a spiritual leader, ensuring the nation's worship was conducted according to God's commandments.<p><b>on the altar he had built for the LORD</b><br>This altar was part of the temple complex that Solomon constructed in Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>. The altar was central to the sacrificial system, serving as the place where offerings were made to God. Its construction was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for His name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>).<p><b>burning incense with them before the LORD</b><br>Incense was burned as a symbol of prayers ascending to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>. The burning of incense was a priestly duty, indicating that Solomon was ensuring the proper worship practices were maintained. This act also reflects the importance of maintaining a pleasing aroma before the Lord, symbolizing the people's prayers and devotion.<p><b>So he completed the temple</b><br>The completion of the temple was a significant event in Israel's history, marking the establishment of a permanent place for God's presence among His people. It fulfilled the promise made to David and symbolized God's dwelling with Israel. The temple's completion also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He is the ultimate dwelling place of God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of David, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem built by Solomon as a permanent dwelling for the Ark of the Covenant and a place for worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings_and_peace_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings and Peace Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing atonement and fellowship, respectively.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The structure built by Solomon for offering sacrifices to the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, to whom the offerings and incense were dedicated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_worship.htm">Faithfulness in Worship</a></b><br>Solomon's regular offerings demonstrate the importance of consistent and faithful worship practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifices.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifices</a></b><br>The burnt and peace offerings symbolize atonement and fellowship with God, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/completion_of_the_temple.htm">Completion of the Temple</a></b><br>The completion of the temple signifies the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of a central place for worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership_in_worship.htm">Role of Leadership in Worship</a></b><br>As king, Solomon's dedication to worship sets an example for the nation, highlighting the influence of leaders in spiritual matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/incense_as_prayer.htm">Incense as Prayer</a></b><br>The burning of incense represents prayers rising to God, encouraging believers to maintain a life of prayer.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_9_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_9_25_Solomon_s_worship_acts.htm">How does 1 Kings 9:25 illustrate Solomon's commitment to worship and sacrifice?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Solomon_s_sacrifices_today.htm">What can we learn from Solomon's regular sacrifices about prioritizing worship today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Solomon_s_obedience_to_Deut_12_11-14.htm">How does Solomon's obedience in 1 Kings 9:25 connect to Deuteronomy 12:11-14?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_maintain_worship_like_Solomon_s.htm">In what ways can we ensure our worship is consistent like Solomon's?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Solomon_s_1_Kings_9_25_practice_s_impact.htm">How does Solomon's practice in 1 Kings 9:25 inspire our dedication to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_9_25_Solomon_s_devotion_shown.htm">How does 1 Kings 9:25 reflect Solomon's commitment to God through sacrifices and offerings?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Solomon_sacrifice_thrice_yearly.htm">Why did Solomon offer sacrifices three times a year according to 1 Kings 9:25?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Solomon_build_the_temple_altar.htm">What is the significance of Solomon building the temple altar in 1 Kings 9:25?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_an_altar.htm">What defines an altar?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_solomon's_pagan_altars.htm">1 Kings 11:7 - Is there any archaeological evidence of the pagan altars and high places that Solomon supposedly built?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/solomon's_horse_stalls_count.htm">How many stalls of horses did Solomon have?

The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s house is &#8220;completed&#8221; not merely by stone and gold but by consistent, obedient, God-centered worship that rises from thankful hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And three times in a year.</span>--This verse seems by the last words to be a kind of note or postscript to the description of the completion and consecration of the Temple. To the record of the great inaugural sacrifice it adds a notice of the solemn renewal of the royal offering, both of victims and of incense, three times in a year--no doubt at the three great feasts, the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. As has been already said (see Note on <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm" title="And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.">1Kings 8:63</a>), there is no reason to suppose that on these occasions, or on any others, Solomon personally usurped the pries?s office.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And three times in a year</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, no doubt at the three feasts, the times of greatest solemnity, and when there was the largest concourse of people. See <a href="/2_chronicles/8-12.htm">2 Chronicles 8:12</a>. The design of this verse may be to show that there was no longer any offering on high places. It would thus refer to <a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>, as ver. 24 to <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>] <span class="cmt_word">did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord</span> [the chronicler adds, "before the porch"], <span class="cmt_word">and he burnt incense.</span> [It has been supposed by some that Solomon sacrificed and burnt incense <span class="accented">propria manu</span>. According to Dean Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2. pp. 220, 221), "he solemnly entered, not only the temple courts with sacrifices, but penetrated into the Holy Place itself, where in later years none but the priests were allowed to enter, and offered incense on the altar of incense." But this positive statement is absolutely destitute of all basis. For, in the first place, there is nothing in the text to support it. If Solomon ordered, or defrayed the cost of, the sacrifices, etc., as no doubt he did, the historian would properly and naturally describe him as offering burnt offerings. <span class="accented">Qui facit per alium facit per se</span>, and priests are expressly mentioned as present at these sacrifices (<a href="/1_kings/8-6.htm">1 Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7-14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-2.htm">2 Chronicles 7:2, 5</a>). We have just as much reason, and no more, for believing that the king built Mille (ver. 24) with his own hands, and with his own hands "made a navy of ships" (ver. 26), as that he sacrificed, etc., <span class="accented">in propria persona</span>. And, secondly, it is simply inconceivable, if he had so acted, that it should have attracted no more notice, and that our historian should have passed it over thus lightly. We know what is recorded by our author as having happened when, less than two centuries afterwards, King Uzziah presumed to intrude on the functions of the priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); cf. <a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>), and we know what had happened some five centuries before (<a href="/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>), when men who were not of the seed of Aaron came near to offer incense before the Lord. It is impossible that Solomon could have disregarded that solemn warning without some protest, or without a syllable of blame on the part of our author. And the true account of these sacrifices is that they were offered by the king as the <span class="accented">builder of the temple</span>, and probably throughout his life, by the hands of the ministering priests (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>).
