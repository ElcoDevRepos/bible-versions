His actions, though limited in time, were significant enough to be recorded. Zimri's story is a reminder of the instability and turmoil that characterized the Northern Kingdom of Israel during this period. His acts, though not detailed here, would have included his rise to power through the assassination of King Elah and his subsequent self-destruction when Omri besieged Tirzah.<p><b>and the treason he committed</b><br>Zimri's treason involved the murder of King Elah, the son of Baasha, while Elah was in a drunken state. This act of betrayal highlights the violent and treacherous nature of the political climate in Israel at the time. Treason was a common means of seizing power, reflecting the lack of a stable dynastic succession in the Northern Kingdom. This act can be compared to other biblical accounts of treachery, such as Absalom's rebellion against David.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase indicates that there were other historical records, now lost, that detailed the events of the kings of Israel. The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is distinct from the biblical books of Chronicles and served as a source for the authors of Kings. This reference underscores the historical nature of the biblical narrative and suggests that the biblical authors had access to other historical documents. The mention of this book also emphasizes the importance of written records in preserving the history and lessons of Israel's monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel who conspired against and assassinated King Elah, becoming king himself for a brief period of seven days.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elah.htm">Elah</a></b><br>The king of Israel whom Zimri assassinated.
