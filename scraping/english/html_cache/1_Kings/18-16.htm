Despite Ahab's idolatrous reign, Obadiah remained faithful to God, even risking his life to protect the prophets of the LORD (<a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3-4</a>). His role as a mediator between Elijah and Ahab highlights the tension between serving a corrupt regime and maintaining personal faithfulness. This act of informing Ahab demonstrates Obadiah's obedience and courage, as he navigates his dual responsibilities to God and king. The name "Obadiah" means "servant of Yahweh," reflecting his dedication to God despite the political climate.<p><b>who went to meet Elijah</b><br>Ahab's decision to meet Elijah is significant, given the prophet's role in declaring the drought as a judgment from God (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). Elijah, whose name means "My God is Yahweh," stands as a lone voice of truth against the widespread Baal worship promoted by Ahab and Jezebel. This meeting sets the stage for the dramatic confrontation on Mount Carmel, where Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-20.htm">1 Kings 18:20-40</a>). The encounter between Ahab and Elijah underscores the ongoing conflict between the worship of Yahweh and the idolatry of Baal, a theme prevalent throughout the narrative of the Northern Kingdom. Elijah's boldness in confronting Ahab foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's truth over falsehood, a theme echoed in the New Testament through the person and work of Jesus Christ, who confronts and overcomes the powers of sin and darkness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the Lord who served as the palace administrator for King Ahab.
