The expression "rests with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, indicating burial in the family tomb. This reflects the cultural practice of honoring ancestors and maintaining family lineage. The phrase also underscores the transition of leadership and the importance of securing the succession to the throne. David's impending death creates urgency for Bathsheba and Nathan to ensure Solomon's rightful place as king, as promised by David (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<p><b>I and my son Solomon will be counted as criminals.</b><br>Bathsheba expresses concern for her and Solomon's safety, highlighting the political tension and potential for violence during royal successions. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, it was common for new rulers to eliminate rivals to secure their reign. Adonijah, another of David's sons, was attempting to claim the throne, which posed a direct threat to Solomon's life and Bathsheba's status. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in establishing leaders, as seen in Solomon's eventual anointing and reign, fulfilling God's promise to David. Solomon's kingship also prefigures the peace and wisdom associated with the future reign of Christ, the ultimate King in the line of David (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, whose succession is in question.

(It is also found in the message of promise by Nathan. <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12</a>, relating to the succession of the son who should build the Temple.) We find corresponding expressions in <a href="/genesis/15-15.htm" title="And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.">Genesis 15:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>. Without connecting with the use of this phrase anything like the fulness of meaning which in the New Testament attaches to "the sleep" of the departed servants of God (as known to be a "sleep in Jesus"), it seems not unreasonable to recognise in it, at least, a rudimentary belief in death as rest and not extinction. The addition, "with his fathers," has probably a reference to "the tombs of the kings;" especially as we find that it is not adopted in the cases of Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm" title="Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. However, they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.">2Chronicles 21:20</a>) and Joash. (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-25.htm" title="And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.">2Chronicles 24:25</a>), who were not buried therein.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Otherwise</span> [there is no corresponding word in the Hebrews] <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep</span> [strictly, "lie down:" see on 1 Kings 2:10] <span class="cmt_word">with his fathers</span> [this phrase, so common in the books of Kings and Chronicles, only occurs "once in the Pentateuch (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>) and once in the historical books before Kings" (Rawlinson).
