This area is significant in biblical history as it was where Moses fled after killing an Egyptian and where he encountered God in the burning bush. The mention of Midian here indicates a starting point for Hadad's journey, suggesting a strategic retreat or regrouping before moving towards Egypt. The Midianites were known for their nomadic lifestyle and trade, which might have facilitated Hadad's movement.<p><b>and went to Paran.</b><br>Paran is a desert region mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often associated with the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites. It is located in the Sinai Peninsula, south of Canaan. The journey from Midian to Paran would have been arduous, indicating Hadad's determination and possibly his strategic planning to gather support. Paran's mention also connects to the broader narrative of God's people in the wilderness, highlighting themes of exile and divine providence.<p><b>They took men from Paran with them</b><br>This phrase suggests that Hadad was able to gather additional support from the inhabitants of Paran. This could imply that there were sympathizers or mercenaries willing to join his cause. The recruitment of men from Paran indicates a growing force, which would have been necessary for Hadad's plans to challenge Solomon's rule. This action reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of forming alliances and building coalitions for military or political purposes.<p><b>and went to Egypt,</b><br>Egypt was a powerful and influential kingdom during this period, often serving as a place of refuge or alliance for those opposing Israel. The journey to Egypt signifies a strategic move by Hadad, seeking support from a major power. Egypt's historical role as both a place of refuge and a source of oppression for the Israelites adds complexity to Hadad's actions, as he seeks aid from a nation that had previously enslaved his ancestors.<p><b>to Pharaoh king of Egypt,</b><br>The Pharaoh at this time would have been a significant political figure, capable of providing military and economic support. The relationship between Israel and Egypt was complex, with periods of both conflict and cooperation. By approaching Pharaoh, Hadad was aligning himself with a powerful ally, potentially threatening Solomon's reign. This move reflects the broader geopolitical dynamics of the region, where smaller states often sought the backing of larger empires.<p><b>who gave Hadad a house and land</b><br>Pharaoh's provision of a house and land to Hadad indicates a formal acceptance and support of his cause. This gesture would have been significant, as it not only provided Hadad with a base of operations but also signaled Pharaoh's endorsement. In the ancient Near East, such gifts were often used to solidify alliances and demonstrate loyalty. This act of hospitality contrasts with the typical portrayal of Egypt as an adversary, highlighting the complexities of international relations.<p><b>and provided him with food.</b><br>The provision of food further underscores Pharaoh's commitment to supporting Hadad. In a time when resources were often scarce, especially for exiles or refugees, this act of generosity would have been crucial for Hadad's survival and the maintenance of his followers. This support reflects the ancient practice of patronage, where powerful rulers would sustain those who could serve their interests. It also echoes the biblical theme of divine provision, as seen in God's care for His people throughout their history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadad.htm">Hadad</a></b><br>A member of the royal family of Edom who fled to Egypt after David's conquest of Edom.

The Lord had already &#8220;raised up&#8221; Hadad for this purpose (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>), showing God&#8217;s sovereignty even in the choices of displaced peoples.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went to Paran</b><p>&#8220;...and went to Paran.&#8221;

This expansion signals intent: Hadad is not seeking permanent refuge but strategic advantage for future conflict (<a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; God often permits such alliances to fulfill larger purposes, as He later does with Rezon of Damascus (<a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><p>&#8220;...and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt...&#8221;
