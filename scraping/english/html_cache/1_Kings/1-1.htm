His reign has been marked by significant achievements, including the unification of Israel and Judah and the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital. David's age signifies a transition period for Israel, as leadership will soon pass to the next generation. This phrase sets the stage for the events that follow, highlighting the need for a successor. David's age is also a reminder of the human condition and the inevitability of aging, even for a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><b>and though they covered him with blankets</b><br>The mention of blankets indicates an attempt to provide physical comfort to the aging king. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the use of blankets or garments was a common method to provide warmth. This detail underscores David's frailty and vulnerability, contrasting with his earlier years of strength and vigor. It also reflects the care and concern of those around him, possibly his servants or family, who are attending to his needs.<p><b>he could not keep warm</b><br>David's inability to stay warm despite being covered with blankets suggests a decline in his health, possibly due to poor circulation or other age-related issues. This physical weakness is symbolic of the waning of his earthly power and influence. It foreshadows the political maneuvering and struggles for succession that will soon unfold, as seen in the subsequent chapters. The imagery of David's coldness can also be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral challenges that Israel will face in the absence of strong leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the second king of Israel, known for his heart for God, his military conquests, and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the nation's capital.

The narrative flow moves straight from the closing scenes of 2 Samuel&#8212;David&#8217;s census and its aftermath&#8212;into the final days of the same king&#8217;s life.<p>&#8211; Scripture often marks turning points with &#8220;now&#8221; (e.g., <a href="/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>). It invites the reader to pause and recognize a divinely ordered transition: a season is ending, and another is about to dawn.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>King David</b><p>&#8211; God&#8217;s anointed ruler, the man after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>), is still center stage.<p>&#8211; Cross references: <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a> shows God&#8217;s covenant with David; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-4.htm">1 Chronicles 28:4</a> recalls how the Lord chose him from Jesse&#8217;s sons. The covenant promises stand firm even when the king weakens.<p>&#8211; The mention of &#8220;King&#8221; underscores that David remains Israel&#8217;s legitimate monarch until his last breath, countering any later claims that his failing health voided his authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was old and well along in years</b><p>&#8211; The phrase &#8220;well along in years&#8221; (literally &#8220;advanced in days&#8221;) highlights physical aging in its fullest sense.<p>&#8211; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-1.htm">1 Chronicles 23:1</a> echoes this moment: &#8220;When David was old and full of years&#8230;&#8221; Abraham (<a href="/genesis/24-1.htm">Genesis 24:1</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/23-1.htm">Joshua 23:1-2</a>) faced similar descriptions. Scripture treats old age as an honorable season, yet it also records its limits without hiding them.<p>&#8211; Practical implications: the kingdom will soon require new leadership. This line sets up Solomon&#8217;s succession (<a href="/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28-39</a>) and exposes the urgency behind Adonijah&#8217;s later grab for power (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though they covered him with blankets</b><p>&#8211; Servants attempt the obvious remedy&#8212;piling on extra warmth.

God allows human solutions to reach their limit so His purposes move forward (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where weakness sets the stage for divine strength).<p>&#8211; The detail is historical and literal, reminding us the Bible records concrete reality, not myth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He could not keep warm</b><p>&#8211; Circulation fails; the body that once slew Goliath can no longer regulate its temperature. This symptom embodies the broader frailty of life described in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1-5</a>.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a> voices the elderly believer&#8217;s plea: &#8220;Do not cast me off in my old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails.&#8221; David&#8217;s condition fulfills his own earlier song.<p>&#8211; The inability to stay warm propels the caregivers to seek Abishag the Shunammite (<a href="/1_kings/1-2.htm">1 Kings 1:2-4</a>), a culturally accepted practice for therapeutic warmth and care in that era. Yet the text carefully notes there was no sexual union (v. 4), preserving the integrity of the aging king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm">1 Kings 1:1</a> paints a candid portrait of Israel&#8217;s greatest earthly king at the threshold of death. The simple report&#8212;David is old, covered with blankets, still cold&#8212;anchors the coming political drama in undeniable human frailty. God&#8217;s covenant remains sure, but His servant&#8217;s body is fading. From this gentle yet pointed introduction, the chapter will unfold a divinely guided transfer of power, reminding every reader that kingdoms rise and fall, but the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand firm forever (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Now king David</span>.--"Now" is the simple illative conjunction "and," found at the beginning of all the historical books (Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, &c.). It marks the general conception of the unity of the whole history, but implies nothing of special connection of time or authorship with the books of Samuel. In fact, although these books are in some sense the continuation of the former, yet the narrative is hardly continuous. The history passes at once to the closing scene of David's life, leaving a comparative blank in the period succeeding the restoration after the defeat of Absalom--a blank which is partly filled up in the later books (1 Chronicles 22-29).<p><span class= "bld">Stricken in years</span>--about seventy years old. Since "clothes" mean "bed-clothes," the meaning is that the King was now too feeble to rise from his bed. His life began its responsibilities early; it had been hard and trying; and, as the history shows, not wholly free from self-indulgence. Hence, at no excessive age, its complete decrepitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> [Hebrews <span class="accented">and</span>, but "now" more nearly expresses the import of the original, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> has here little or no connecting force.
