The Arameans were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. The servants' counsel reflects the common practice of seeking advice from trusted advisors in ancient Near Eastern courts. This moment follows a defeat by Israel, highlighting the political and military tension between the two nations.<p><b>&#8220;Their gods are gods of the hills.</b><br>The Arameans' belief that Israel's God was limited to the hills reflects a common ancient Near Eastern view that deities were geographically bound. This misunderstanding of Yahweh's omnipotence is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God demonstrates His power over all creation. The hills of Israel, such as those in Samaria and Jerusalem, were often associated with worship, possibly influencing the Arameans' perception.<p><b>That is why they prevailed over us.</b><br>The Arameans attribute their defeat to the supposed geographical limitation of Israel's God, rather than acknowledging His true power. This reflects a lack of understanding of Yahweh's nature, contrasting with the biblical narrative that emphasizes God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel. The victory was a demonstration of God's support for His people, as seen in other biblical battles where God intervenes on behalf of Israel.<p><b>Instead, we should fight them on the plains;</b><br>The plains, such as the Jezreel Valley, were seen as more favorable for chariot warfare, which the Arameans likely excelled in. This strategic shift indicates their reliance on military tactics rather than seeking divine guidance. The plains were also significant in biblical history, being the site of many battles, including those involving figures like Deborah and Barak.<p><b>surely then we will prevail.</b><br>The Arameans' confidence in victory on the plains underscores their reliance on human strategy and misunderstanding of God's power. This sets the stage for God to demonstrate His sovereignty over all terrain, not just the hills. The narrative foreshadows God's continued protection and deliverance of Israel, regardless of the battlefield, emphasizing His omnipotence and the futility of opposing His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_aram.htm">King of Aram (Ben-Hadad)</a></b><br>The ruler of Aram (Syria) who is in conflict with Israel.

Now the greater part of the territory where Jehovah was worshipped was a hill-country. Samaria in particular, the scene of recent defeat, lay in the mountain region of Ephraim. The Israelite armies, moreover, being mostly of infantry--having, indeed, few or no cavalry, except in the time of Solomon--naturally encamped and fought, as far as possible, on the hills; as Barak on Mount Tabor (<a href="/context/judges/4-6.htm" title="And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said to him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?">Judges 4:6-14</a>), Saul on Mount Gilboa (<a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.">1Samuel 31:1</a>), and Ahab himself (in <a href="/1_kings/20-27.htm" title="And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.">1Kings 20:27</a>). Perhaps the worship of Jehovah in the "high places" may have also conduced to this belief that the "gods of Israel were gods of the hills," whose power vanished in the plains; where, of course, the Syrian armies of chariots and horsemen would naturally fight at advantage. Shrewd policy might, as so often is the case, lurk in the advice of Ben-hadad's counsellors under the cover of superstition; as, indeed, it seems also to show itself in seizing the opportunity to increase the central power, by organising the troops of the tributary kings under officers of his own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him</span> [naturally anxious to retrieve their character and obliterate their disgrace], <span class="cmt_word">Their gods are gods of the hills</span> [All pagan nations have believed in local deities, <span class="accented">Dii montium, dii nemorum, etc</span>. (see <a href="/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33-35</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12, 13</a>). Keil accounts for this belief - that the gods of Israel were mountain divinities, by the consideration that the temple was built on <span class="accented">Mount</span> Moriah, and that worship was always offered on "<span class="accented">high</span> places." Kitto reminds us that the law was given from Mount Sinai, and that fire had recently descended on Mount Carmel. "In Syrophoenicia, even mountains themselves had Divine honours paid to them" (Movers, Phoen. 1:667 sqq.)
