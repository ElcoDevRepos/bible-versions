His enmity is rooted in the political fragmentation following King David's consolidation of power. Rezon had fled from his master, Hadadezer, king of Zobah, after David's victories (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3-8</a>). Establishing himself in Damascus, Rezon became a thorn in Solomon's side, symbolizing the external threats that arose due to Solomon's internal compromises, such as his marriages to foreign women and idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>). This period marks a shift from the peace and prosperity of Solomon's early reign to increasing instability.<p><b>adding to the trouble caused by Hadad</b><br>Hadad the Edomite was another adversary who rose against Solomon. He had fled to Egypt as a child after Joab, David's commander, decimated Edom (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-22</a>). Upon returning, Hadad sought to reclaim his position and territory, further destabilizing Solomon's kingdom. The combined threats of Rezon and Hadad illustrate the fulfillment of God's warning to Solomon about the consequences of turning away from Him (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-13</a>). These adversaries represent the divine judgment and the fracturing of the united monarchy, foreshadowing the eventual division of Israel.<p><b>So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel</b><br>Rezon's rule over Aram (modern-day Syria) established a powerful kingdom that consistently opposed Israel. Aram's strategic location and military strength posed a significant threat to Israel's northern borders. This hostility is part of a broader narrative of Israel's ongoing struggles with neighboring nations, which often served as instruments of divine discipline. The enmity between Aram and Israel continued into the reigns of subsequent kings, such as Ahab and Jehoram, highlighting the persistent geopolitical tensions in the region (<a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8-23</a>). Rezon's opposition underscores the theme of Israel's reliance on God for protection and the consequences of disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezon.htm">Rezon</a></b><br>A leader who became an adversary to Israel during Solomon's reign.

The statement is straightforward: from Solomon&#8217;s early reign until his death, Israel faced this relentless adversary.<p>&#8226; Rezon first appears just two verses earlier: &#8220;God raised up Rezon son of Eliada as an adversary to Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>). He had fled from his former master, Hadadezer of Zobah, after David&#8217;s victories (<a href="/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Solomon&#8217;s rule is often remembered for peace (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24-25</a>), that peace was never absolute. Rezon&#8217;s presence shows how the Lord could withdraw protective favor when the king&#8217;s heart drifted (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The text underscores a continual threat, not a single skirmish. This steady pressure foreshadows later Syrian aggressions under kings like Ben-Hadad (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>) and Hazael (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Adding to the trouble caused by Hadad</b><p>&#8226; Rezon &#8220;add[ed] to the trouble caused by Hadad&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>). Hadad, an Edomite prince, had already been stirred up against Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Two simultaneous adversaries&#8212;one from the south (Edom) and one from the north (Aram)&#8212;hemmed Israel in. This dual threat highlights covenant consequences: when Solomon multiplied foreign wives and their idols (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), the Lord permitted external pressures (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern becomes clear: instead of immediate national collapse, God applies corrective discipline through neighboring enemies, giving opportunity for repentance while fulfilling His word that the kingdom would be torn away after Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a>). Aram, centered in Damascus, lay on Israel&#8217;s northeastern border and controlled key trade routes. By seizing power there (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), Rezon gained strategic leverage.<p>&#8226; Hostility took daily form: border raids, trade disruptions, and military intimidation. Later prophetic history shows Aram repeatedly clashing with Israel (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8-23</a>). Rezon pioneers that adversarial pattern.<p>&#8226; God remains sovereign over international politics. Just as He &#8220;raised up&#8221; Rezon (<a href="/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>), He later &#8220;gave rest&#8221; or &#8220;delivered&#8221; Israel depending on national faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/13-4.htm">2 Kings 13:4-5</a>). The verse reveals that earthly rulers may think they act independently, yet they serve divine purposes (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse is a vivid reminder that unfaithfulness invites discipline, but discipline is not abandonment. The Davidic line continues, and through it comes the promised Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-25.htm">1 Kings 11:25</a> shows Rezon as a lifelong northern adversary raised by God to press Solomon&#8217;s kingdom. Together with Hadad from the south, he embodied the Lord&#8217;s corrective response to Solomon&#8217;s idolatry. Rezon&#8217;s rule over Aram signaled the beginning of a long Syrian hostility that would test Israel for generations, yet it also testified to God&#8217;s ongoing control of history and His unwavering commitment to both justice and covenant promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Beside the mischief that Hadad did.</span>--The expression, as it stands, is curiously abrupt in its recurrence to Hadad.

If the general reading of the LXX. be taken, the substitution of Edom for Syria (<span class= "ital">Aram</span>) (it involves but slight change in the Hebrew) must be accepted; if the explanation of Josephus is correct, then the reading of the text must stand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon</span> [We are not compelled, however, to believe that his reign lasted "all the days of Solomon."
