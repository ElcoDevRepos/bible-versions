The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a recurring biblical expression indicating actions contrary to God's commandments. This highlights the divine perspective on Baasha's reign, emphasizing God's omniscience and moral standards. The evil mentioned here often refers to idolatry and the abandonment of the covenant with God, which were prevalent issues in Israel during this period.<p><b>and walked in the way of Jeroboam</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the divided northern kingdom, set a precedent of idolatry by establishing golden calves at Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from worshiping in Jerusalem. "Walking in the way of Jeroboam" implies that Baasha continued these idolatrous practices, leading the nation away from true worship. This phrase underscores the influence of Jeroboam's legacy and the persistent spiritual decline in Israel. It also serves as a warning about the long-lasting impact of a leader's actions on a nation.<p><b>and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam's sin was not only personal but also corporate, as he led the entire nation into idolatry. This phrase highlights the responsibility of leaders for the spiritual direction of their people. The sin of idolatry was a direct violation of the first two commandments given to Moses, and it had severe consequences for Israel, including divine judgment and eventual exile. The phrase serves as a reminder of the communal nature of sin and its repercussions, as well as the importance of faithful leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>The king of Israel who continued in the sinful ways of Jeroboam, leading the nation into further idolatry and disobedience against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division.
