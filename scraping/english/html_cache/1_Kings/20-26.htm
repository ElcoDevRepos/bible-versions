The weather was more favorable, and food supplies were more accessible after the winter months. This timing reflects a strategic decision common in ancient warfare.<p><b>Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans</b><br>Ben-hadad was the king of Aram, a region located in present-day Syria. The Arameans were a significant power in the region and often in conflict with Israel. This mobilization indicates a well-organized military campaign, suggesting that Ben-hadad was a formidable leader. The Arameans' frequent conflicts with Israel are documented throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the ongoing tension between these neighboring nations.<p><b>and went up to Aphek</b><br>Aphek was a strategically important city, mentioned several times in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). It was located in the northern part of Israel, near the Jezreel Valley, a crucial area for controlling trade routes and military movements. Archaeological evidence suggests that Aphek was a fortified city, making it a significant military target.<p><b>to fight against Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the persistent hostilities between Israel and Aram. The conflict is part of a larger narrative of Israel's struggles with surrounding nations, often due to Israel's disobedience to God. The battles between Israel and Aram are a recurring theme, illustrating the challenges Israel faced in maintaining its sovereignty and faithfulness to God amidst external threats. This conflict also sets the stage for God's intervention, as seen in the subsequent verses, where God delivers Israel despite their smaller numbers, demonstrating His power and faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who is a recurring adversary of Israel.
