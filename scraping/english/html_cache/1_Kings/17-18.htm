It is used throughout the Old Testament to refer to prophets and those who are seen as messengers of God (e.g., Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>). This acknowledgment by the widow indicates her awareness of Elijah's divine connection and the power associated with his presence.<p><b>"said the woman to Elijah,"</b><br>The woman is the widow of Zarephath, a Gentile living in Phoenician territory, which is significant as it shows God's work beyond Israel. Elijah's presence in her home is a result of God's command during a time of drought and famine (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>). This interaction highlights the cross-cultural and cross-religious dynamics at play, as Elijah, an Israelite prophet, is staying with a non-Israelite.<p><b>"what have you done to me?"</b><br>This question reflects the widow's distress and confusion. In ancient Near Eastern culture, there was a belief that the presence of a holy person could bring both blessing and judgment. Her question suggests a fear that Elijah's presence has brought divine scrutiny or misfortune upon her household.<p><b>"Have you come to remind me of my iniquity"</b><br>The widow's reference to her "iniquity" suggests an awareness of personal sin or guilt. In the context of the Old Testament, sin is often associated with suffering or divine punishment (e.g., <a href="/job/4-7.htm">Job 4:7-8</a>). Her statement implies a belief that her past sins might be the cause of her current suffering, a common theological perspective in the ancient world.<p><b>"and cause the death of my son?"</b><br>The death of her son is a devastating event, especially for a widow who relied on her offspring for future security and support. In biblical times, children were seen as a blessing and a sign of God's favor (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). The widow's lament can be seen as a cry of desperation, questioning the justice and purpose of God in her suffering. This moment sets the stage for Elijah's subsequent miracle, which prefigures Christ's power over death, as seen in the New Testament accounts of Jesus raising the dead (e.g., <a href="/luke/7-11.htm">Luke 7:11-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his powerful ministry and miracles, including the confrontation with the prophets of Baal.

Pain can distort memory, causing us to overlook earlier mercies&#8212;like the miracle of the never-ending jar of flour and jug of oil (<a href="/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Sorrow is not sin in itself, yet it can tempt us to accuse God&#8217;s servants unfairly, forgetting <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The question also shows relational intimacy; Elijah is not a distant prophet but a guest she trusted, which makes the sudden tragedy feel like betrayal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have you come to remind me of my iniquity&#8221;</b><p>The conscience awakens when confronted with holiness.<p>&#8226; As Isaiah cried, &#8220;Woe is me! &#8230; I am a man of unclean lips&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), so this widow senses her failings in the light of God&#8217;s purity.<p>&#8226; Her assumption&#8212;that past sins trigger present suffering&#8212;was common (cf. <a href="/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>). While Scripture does connect sin and death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), not every hardship is a direct payback.<p>&#8226; Yet the Spirit often uses trials to spotlight hidden guilt, inviting repentance. David admitted, &#8220;When I kept silent, my bones wasted away&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The widow&#8217;s honesty prepares the way for grace; confession is the doorway through which God&#8217;s compassion enters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and cause the death of my son?&#8221;</b><p>The ultimate fear surfaces: loss interpreted as judgment.<p>&#8226; She links sin to death, echoing <a href="/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, &#8220;The soul who sins is the one who will die.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Death&#8217;s sting feels final, but in God&#8217;s plan it becomes the stage for resurrection power. Moments later, &#8220;the LORD heard Elijah&#8217;s cry, and the boy&#8217;s life returned to him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This first recorded resurrection in Scripture foreshadows greater victories: the Shunammite&#8217;s son (<a href="/2_kings/4-35.htm">2 Kings 4:35</a>), the widow of Nain&#8217;s boy (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-15</a>), and ultimately Christ Himself (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The widow&#8217;s anguish, though rooted in misunderstanding, leads to a stronger revelation of God&#8217;s character: &#8220;Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a> captures raw, honest grief colliding with holy presence. The widow recognizes Elijah as God&#8217;s messenger, instinctively connects her sin with her son&#8217;s death, and voices the age-old question of whether suffering is divine retribution. God uses her outburst to highlight human frailty, expose the fear of judgment, and set the scene for a dramatic resurrection that proves His mercy outweighs condemnation. The verse reminds us that when holiness enters our lives, conviction is inevitable, but so is hope, for the same God who reveals sin also provides life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) O <span class= "bld">thou man of</span> <span class= "bld">God.</span>--The terms of the address (contrasted with <a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm" title="And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.">1Kings 17:12</a>), indicate a natural growth in the recognition of the true God by the woman, through familiar intercourse with the prophet, and experience of his wonder-working power. For it is the adoption of the regular Israelitish description of the prophet as her own. (See <a href="/judges/13-6.htm" title="Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm" title="But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,">1Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</span>--The words express the unreasonableness of natural sorrow. The underlying idea is that of the exclamation, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." The better knowledge of God, gained through the presence of the prophet, had, of course, brought out in her a deeper sense of sin, and now makes her feel that her sorrow is a just punishment. With pathetic confusion of idea, she cries out against his presence, as if it were the actual cause of judgment on the sin, which it has simply brought home to her conscience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">what to me</span> and thee.
