The seven-day standoff may symbolize a period of divine preparation or testing. The Arameans and Israelites were encamped in the region of Aphek, a strategic location in northern Israel, which has been identified through archaeological findings. This period of waiting could reflect a psychological warfare tactic, testing the resolve and patience of both armies.<p><b>and on the seventh day the battle ensued</b><br>The seventh day marks a turning point, reminiscent of the Sabbath, a day of divine intervention and rest. The timing suggests that God orchestrated the events, aligning with His pattern of using the seventh day for significant acts. This battle is part of a series of conflicts between Israel and Aram, highlighting the ongoing struggle for dominance in the region. The sudden commencement of battle after a week of inactivity underscores the unpredictability of ancient warfare.<p><b>and the Israelites struck down the Arameans&#8212;a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day</b><br>This overwhelming victory is attributed to divine intervention, as the Israelites were often outnumbered by their enemies. The defeat of a hundred thousand Aramean soldiers in a single day emphasizes the miraculous nature of the victory, similar to other biblical battles where God delivered Israel against overwhelming odds (e.g., Gideon's victory in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, a theme echoed in eschatological prophecies. The scale of the defeat also serves as a testament to God's power and faithfulness to His covenant with Israel, reinforcing the idea that success in battle is not by might, but by the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are engaged in battle against the Arameans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>The opposing army, often at odds with Israel, representing the forces against God's people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, known for his complex relationship with God and his often wayward leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The conflict between the Israelites and the Arameans, which culminates in a significant victory for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_days.htm">Seven Days</a></b><br>The period during which the two armies camped opposite each other before engaging in battle, symbolizing a period of preparation and divine timing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_timing.htm">Divine Timing</a></b><br>God's timing is perfect, and His plans unfold according to His divine schedule.

That two comparatively small companies should be able, physically, to slay, with the rude weapons of that age, 100,000 warriors, fighting for their lives, seems hardly credible. It is probable, therefore, that the numbers here, as elsewhere, have been exaggerated in the course of transcription. Another explanation of the difficulty has, indeed, been suggested by Bahr, viz., that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> may signify here, as it undoubtedly does elsewhere, "defeated," "put to flight" (see <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4</a>, etc.) And the Hebrew at first sight seems to favour this idea, for it may be rendered literally, they smote <span class="accented">Syria, a hundred thousand, etc</span>. The 100,000 would then represent the entire strength of the Syrian infantry. But the mention of the "footmen" and of "one day" alike suggests that it is of slaughter, not dispersion, that the historian speaks.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For seven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the armies] camped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
