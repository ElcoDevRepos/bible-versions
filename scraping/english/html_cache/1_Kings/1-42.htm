The context is a gathering where Adonijah, son of King David, is attempting to establish himself as king. The timing of the interruption is crucial, as it occurs during a pivotal moment in Adonijah's self-proclaimed coronation.<p><b>suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived</b><br>Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, is a significant figure due to his lineage. Abiathar was a priest during King David's reign, and his presence here connects to the broader narrative of David's kingdom. Abiathar's support of Adonijah contrasts with Zadok the priest's support of Solomon, highlighting the division within the priesthood. This division reflects the political and spiritual tensions of the time. Jonathan's sudden arrival suggests an unexpected development, often a literary device indicating a shift in the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Adonijah</b><br>Adonijah's invitation to Jonathan reflects his confidence and expectation of favorable news. Adonijah, as David's son, assumes authority and control, evident in his welcoming demeanor. This moment underscores Adonijah's ambition and his attempt to consolidate power, despite not being the chosen successor.<p><b>&#8220;for you are a man of valor</b><br>Adonijah's description of Jonathan as a "man of valor" is significant. Valor, often associated with bravery and honor, suggests that Jonathan is respected and trusted. This acknowledgment indicates that Jonathan's report is expected to be credible and significant. The term "man of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe individuals of notable courage and integrity, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>).<p><b>You must be bringing good news.&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's assumption that Jonathan brings "good news" reveals his expectations and desires. In the cultural context, messengers often brought news of victory or defeat, and the anticipation of good news reflects Adonijah's hope for confirmation of his kingship. This expectation is ironic, as the narrative soon reveals that Jonathan's news is not favorable to Adonijah. The concept of "good news" or "gospel" is later echoed in the New Testament, where it signifies the message of salvation through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of Abiathar the priest, Jonathan is a messenger in this account.

While Joab speaks, Jonathan&#8217;s sudden arrival interrupts, signaling divine intervention. Adonijah&#8217;s confident welcome, praise of valor, and expectation of good news reveal his pride and spiritual blindness. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes prevail swiftly and decisively, often through unexpected messengers, and that human schemes cannot stand against the Lord&#8217;s declared will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">Jonathan the son of Abiathar</span>.--See <a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm" title="The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.">2Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17-21</a>, where he is named, with Ahimaaz, as a swift runner, fit to be a messenger. It is curious that a similar greeting to his companion Ahimaaz is used by David in <a href="/2_samuel/18-27.htm" title="And the watchman said, Me thinks the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings.">2Samuel 18:27</a>--possibly as a kind of omen of good fortune.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest</span> [Cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-36.htm">2 Samuel 15:36</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17</a>.

The idea, "a good man will bring good news" corresponds with that of the proverb of <a href="/1_samuel/24-13.htm">1 Samuel 24:13</a>. Adonijah's misgivings reveal themselves in these words. He fears the worst, but strives to put on a cheerful face and to encourage his guests.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/1-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As he was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1443;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124;
