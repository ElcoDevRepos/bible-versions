In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of hospitality and peace. The prophet from Bethel and the man of God from Judah are in a moment of apparent reconciliation and trust, despite the earlier deception. This setting contrasts with the impending divine message, highlighting the unexpected nature of God's interventions. Meals in biblical narratives often serve as pivotal moments, such as the Last Supper in the New Testament, where significant spiritual truths are revealed.<p><b>the word of the LORD came</b><br>This phrase signifies a divine revelation or message, a common occurrence in the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. The "word of the LORD" is a powerful and authoritative communication from God, often delivered through prophets. It underscores the belief in God's active involvement in human affairs and His ability to communicate His will directly. This divine word often brings guidance, correction, or judgment, as seen in the messages delivered by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The phrase also emphasizes the sovereignty of God, who can choose any moment or setting to convey His message.<p><b>to the prophet who had brought him back</b><br>This refers to the older prophet from Bethel who had deceived the man of God from Judah. Despite his earlier actions, God chooses to use him as a vessel for His message. This highlights the complexity of God's dealings with humanity, where even flawed individuals can be instruments of His will. It also serves as a reminder of the seriousness of the prophetic office and the weight of delivering God's message accurately. The older prophet's role in this narrative can be seen as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of adhering to God's commands, as seen in other biblical accounts like that of Jonah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god_from_judah.htm">The Man of God from Judah</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.

Josephus, with his perverse tendency to explain away all that seems startling, misses this point entirely, and assigns the revelation to the prophet of Judah himself.
