In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a queen mother held a significant position of influence and respect. Bathsheba's approach to Solomon reflects the protocol and respect due to a king, even from his own mother. The use of "small request" suggests humility and an appeal to Solomon's sense of duty and familial loyalty.<p><b>she said.</b><br>This indicates Bathsheba's direct communication with Solomon. In the narrative of 1 Kings, Bathsheba's role is pivotal, as she was instrumental in securing Solomon's succession to the throne. Her speech here is part of a larger narrative where she intercedes on behalf of Adonijah, Solomon's older brother, who had previously attempted to usurp the throne.<p><b>Do not deny me.</b><br>This plea underscores the seriousness of Bathsheba's request. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, a request from a mother, especially a queen mother, carried significant weight. The phrase "do not deny me" is a common idiom in biblical literature, often used to express earnestness and the expectation of a favorable response. It reflects the relational dynamics and the expectation of honor and obedience within the family structure.<p><b>Make your request, my mother,</b><br>Solomon's response shows respect and acknowledgment of Bathsheba's position. By addressing her as "my mother," Solomon affirms her authority and the special bond they share. This interaction highlights the importance of family ties and the respect for parental figures in biblical narratives. Solomon's willingness to hear her request demonstrates his wisdom and understanding of the cultural norms of honoring one's parents.<p><b>the king replied,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Solomon's royal status and authority. As king, Solomon had the power to grant or deny requests, and his response is significant in the context of his reign. The narrative of 1 Kings often contrasts Solomon's wisdom and discernment with the political and familial challenges he faces. His reply here is measured and respectful, indicative of his character as portrayed in the biblical text.<p><b>for I will not deny you.</b><br>Solomon's assurance to Bathsheba reflects his commitment to honor her request, highlighting the cultural expectation of filial piety. This promise also sets the stage for the unfolding events, where Solomon must balance personal loyalty with his kingly duties. The phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the challenges Solomon will face in maintaining justice and righteousness, themes central to his reign and wisdom literature. Solomon's willingness to grant Bathsheba's request can be seen as a type of Christ, who also fulfills the requests of those who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The mother of King Solomon, Bathsheba approaches her son with a request.

The promise highlights:<p>&#8226; The power of relationship&#8212;just as believers enjoy access through adoption (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The seriousness of oath&#8212;Solomon binds himself by his word (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; A glimpse of divine generosity&#8212;God &#8220;did not spare His own Son&#8230; how will He not also&#8230; graciously give us all things?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>Yet Solomon&#8217;s later refusal of Adonijah&#8217;s scheme (<a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>) shows promises are subject to righteousness; a pledge does not override wisdom or justice (<a href="/psalms/101-6.htm">Psalm 101:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/2-20.htm">1 Kings 2:20</a> paints a vivid exchange of humble petition and honoring response.
