His position is significant, as it shows that even within a corrupt regime, God has His faithful servants. Obadiah's role is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Joseph and Daniel, who served in foreign or hostile governments yet remained faithful to God.<p><b>&#8220;How have I sinned</b><br>Obadiah's question reflects his fear and confusion. He is aware of the danger posed by Ahab and Jezebel, who have been actively persecuting the prophets of the LORD. His question suggests a sense of injustice, as he has been risking his life to protect God's prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). This highlights the tension between his duties to the king and his loyalty to God.<p><b>that you are handing your servant over to Ahab</b><br>Obadiah's use of "your servant" indicates his humility and submission to Elijah, recognizing the prophet's authority as God's messenger. The phrase "handing over" suggests betrayal, which Obadiah fears, as Ahab has been searching for Elijah to kill him. This reflects the broader theme of the conflict between the worship of Yahweh and Baal, which is central to the narrative of 1 Kings.<p><b>to put me to death?</b><br>Obadiah's fear of death underscores the severity of Ahab's hostility towards the prophets of the LORD. This fear is not unfounded, as Jezebel has already killed many prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). The threat of death for those who serve God is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the lives of prophets and apostles, and ultimately in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also rejected and killed by those in power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>A devout believer in the Lord who served as the palace administrator for King Ahab.

Though loyal to God and Elijah, he fears that obedience may cost his life. His question exposes the tension between serving God&#8217;s prophet and navigating a hostile regime. The verse reminds readers that even devoted believers can experience fear, yet honesty before God and His servants opens the door for reassurance and bold obedience (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>;
