In the context of <a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13</a>, this prophet had been instructed by God not to eat bread or drink water, nor return by the same way he came. This command underscores the importance of obedience to God's specific instructions, highlighting the theme of divine guidance and the consequences of disobedience. The decision to go "another way" signifies his initial adherence to God's command, emphasizing the importance of following divine direction even when it may seem inconvenient or challenging.<p><b>and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.</b><br>Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant location in Israel's history, known for its religious importance. It was one of the places where Jeroboam set up golden calves, leading Israel into idolatry. The man of God's avoidance of the same path symbolizes a break from the idolatrous practices associated with Bethel. This act can be seen as a physical representation of repentance or turning away from sin. The narrative also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of false prophets and the need for discernment, as later in the chapter, the man of God is deceived by another prophet. This story connects to broader biblical themes of testing, obedience, and the consequences of straying from God's commands, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a> about false prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant city in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where King Jeroboam established a center of idol worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, who led Israel into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The altar at Bethel, which Jeroboam used for idol worship, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_command_of_god.htm">The Command of God</a></b><br>The directive given to the man of God not to eat bread or drink water, nor return by the way he came.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The man of God's initial obedience highlights the importance of following God's instructions precisely, even when it requires taking a different path.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complacency.htm">The Danger of Complacency</a></b><br>The man of God's later failure serves as a warning against becoming complacent or disregarding God's commands, even after initial obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_wisdom.htm">Discernment and Wisdom</a></b><br>The need for discernment is crucial, as the man of God later encounters deception.

THE DISOBEDIENCE AND DEATH OF THE MAN OF GOD. - The seduction of the man of God, who has borne such fearless witness against Jeroboam's ecclesiastical policy, and his tragical end, are now narrated, partly because of the deep impression the story made at the time, but principally because these events were in themselves an eloquent testimony against the worship of the calves and the whole ecclesiastical policy of Jeroboam, and a solemn warning for all time against any, the slightest, departure from the commandments of God. The very unfaithfulness of this accredited messenger of the Most High, and the instant punishment it provoked, became part of the Divine protest against the new <span class="accented">regime</span>, against the unfaithfulness of Israel; whilst the remarkable manner in which these occurrences were recalled to the nation's memory in the reign of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17, 18</a>) made it impossible for the historian of the theocracy to pass them over without notice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [the man of God] went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
