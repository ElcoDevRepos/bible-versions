This context highlights the tension between true and false prophecy, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>struck Micaiah in the face</b><br>This act of violence against Micaiah, a true prophet of God, underscores the hostility faced by those who spoke God's truth in opposition to popular opinion or royal desires.

This moment illustrates the spiritual blindness and arrogance of those who reject God's true messengers.<p><b>when He departed from me to speak with you?&#8221;</b><br>Zedekiah's words reveal his presumption of having the Spirit's guidance, despite his false prophecies.

His prideful advance, violent outburst, and sarcastic question all spring from a heart unwilling to yield to the Lord&#8217;s unvarnished truth. While he insists the Spirit must have &#8220;departed&#8221; if it now speaks through someone else, Scripture affirms that the Spirit rests only on those who honor God&#8217;s word.

The words which accompany it evidently convey a sarcastic reference to the knowledge of the secret dealings of God, implied in Micaiah's vision, with a view to turn it into ridicule. Micaiah's answer accordingly passes them by, and merely declares the shame and terror, with which Zedekiah shall find out hereafter the truth of the prophecy of evil. Josephus has a curious addition, that Zedekiah challenged Micaiah to wither up his hand, like the hand of Jeroboam at Bethel, and scouted his prophecy as inconsistent with that of Elijah (<span class= "ital">Antt. </span>viii. 15, ? 4).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah</span> [Rawlinson holds that he was a sort of coryphaeus of the false prophets.

Rawlinson thinks that his hands would be bound, but this is extremely improbable. In that case Ahab could hardly have asked him to prophesy (ver. 15), or if he did, Jehoshaphat would know beforehand what to expect], <span class="cmt_word">and said, Which way</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">What</span>, or <span class="accented">where</span>. The chronicler supplies "way," thereby bringing the expression into unison with <a href="/1_kings/13-12.htm">1 Kings 13:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>; <a href="/job/38-24.htm">Job 38:24</a>] <span class="cmt_word">went</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">passed, crossed</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of the Lord</span> [These words are important, as showing that the speaker had not identified "the spirit" of ver. 21 with the evil spirit: <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> sqq.] <span class="cmt_word">from me to speak unto thee?</span> [It is pretty clear from these words, in connexion with ver. 23, that Zedekiah had been conscious of an inspiration, of a spirit not his own, which impelled him to speak and act as he did. We must not attach too much import-ante to a taunting and passionate speech, but its meaning appears to be: I have spoken in the name and by the spirit of Jehovah. Thou claimest to have done the same. How is it that the Spirit of God speaks one thing by me, another by thee? Thou hast seen (ver. 19) the secret counsels of Heaven. Tell us, then, which way, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/22-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Zedekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6667.htm">Strong's 6667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zedekiah -- 'Yah is righteousness', six Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1462;&#1469;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;en-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Chenaanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3668.htm">Strong's 3668: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chenaanah -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went up,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
