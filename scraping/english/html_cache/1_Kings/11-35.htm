The kingdom, under Solomon, was at its peak in terms of wealth and influence. However, due to Solomon's idolatry and turning away from God, a judgment was pronounced. The ten tribes represent the majority of the tribes of Israel, excluding Judah and Benjamin. This division fulfilled the prophecy given to Ahijah the Shilonite, who tore his new cloak into twelve pieces, symbolizing the division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>).<p><b>from the hand of his son</b><br>Solomon's son, Rehoboam, was set to inherit the kingdom. However, due to Solomon's disobedience, the kingdom would not remain intact under his lineage. This reflects the biblical principle that the sins of the father can have consequences for the children (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Rehoboam's harsh policies and lack of wisdom further contributed to the division (<a href="/1_kings/12-13.htm">1 Kings 12:13-14</a>).<p><b>and give them to you.</b><br>This is directed to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was an official under Solomon. God chose Jeroboam to rule over the ten tribes as a result of Solomon's failure to keep God's covenant. Jeroboam's rise to power was part of God's sovereign plan, despite his later failures in leading the northern kingdom into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>).
