Sacrifices of sheep, oxen, and fattened calves were significant, indicating a grand event, possibly to gain support and allegiance. This mirrors the practices of other biblical figures who offered sacrifices during significant transitions or events, such as Solomon's later sacrifices at Gibeon (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>).<p><b>near the stone of Zoheleth</b><br>The stone of Zoheleth, meaning "serpent" or "crawling thing," is a specific landmark, suggesting a well-known location for gatherings or significant events. Its mention indicates the historical and geographical accuracy of the narrative. The stone's location near Jerusalem would have been strategic for Adonijah, as it was accessible to those he sought to influence.<p><b>which is next to En-rogel</b><br>En-rogel, a spring near Jerusalem, served as a boundary marker between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Its proximity to the city made it a practical location for a gathering. The spring's mention highlights the importance of water sources in ancient settlements and their role in community gatherings and rituals.<p><b>He invited all his royal brothers</b><br>Adonijah's invitation to his royal brothers, excluding Solomon, was a political move to consolidate power and gain legitimacy. This act reflects the tension and rivalry within David's family, reminiscent of Absalom's earlier rebellion (2 Samuel 15). The exclusion of Solomon foreshadows the divine choice of Solomon as king, as later confirmed by Nathan and Bathsheba's intervention (<a href="/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11-31</a>).<p><b>and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king</b><br>By inviting the men of Judah, Adonijah sought the support of his father's tribe, which held significant influence. This move was strategic, as securing the loyalty of Judah's leaders would strengthen his claim to the throne. The reference to "servants of the king" indicates those loyal to David, highlighting the political maneuvering and division within the kingdom. This gathering contrasts with the later anointing of Solomon, who was supported by key figures like Nathan the prophet and Benaiah (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The fourth son of King David, who attempted to declare himself king without David's approval.

By choosing costly animals (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-1.htm">Deuteronomy 17:1</a>), Adonijah strives to cloak his power-grab in religious legitimacy, yet, unlike David&#8217;s heartfelt worship in <a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24&#8211;25</a>, his motive is political, not devotional.<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that mere ritual without obedience is empty (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>); here the lavish ceremony masks rebellion against God&#8217;s declared choice of Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>near the stone of Zoheleth</b><p>&#8226;

Securing family endorsement would appear to legitimize his rule, yet true authority rests on divine appointment, not majority agreement (<a href="/numbers/17-5.htm">Numbers 17:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Notably absent are Nathan and Benaiah&#8212;the prophetic and military voices loyal to God&#8217;s plan&#8212;showing that ungodly schemes avoid godly counsel (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king</b><p>&#8226;

The passage warns that no amount of ceremony, popular support, or strategic location can replace humble obedience to the Lord&#8217;s word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The stone of Zoheleth</span>.--The meaning is uncertain. The derivation seems to be from a root, meaning to "crawl," or "steal on." Some interpreters render, the "stone of the serpents;" the Targums make it "the rolling stone;" other authorities "the stone of the conduit," which would suit well its position as here described.<p><span class= "bld">En-rogel.</span>--"The spring of the fuller." (See <a href="/joshua/15-7.htm" title="And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/18-16.htm" title="And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,">Joshua 18:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm" title="Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.">2Samuel 17:17</a>.)

The authorities are divided between the "Fountain of the virgin" (Ain um ed-Deraj), and the "Well of Job" (Bir Eyub.) See the arguments in Bonar's "Land of Promise," App. 5; Thomson's "Land and Book," vol. 2 p. 528; and Mr. Grove's Art. in Smith's "Dict. Bib." Porter ("Handbook of Palestine ") identifies En-Rogel with Bir Eyub without remark. There is much to be said on either side. The pool of Siloam ("Bib.
