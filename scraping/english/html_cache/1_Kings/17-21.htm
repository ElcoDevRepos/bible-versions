In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical gestures often accompanied prayers and prophetic acts. Stretching out over the child three times may symbolize a complete and earnest appeal to God, as the number three often represents completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. This act can also be seen as a type of Christ, who would later bring life through His own body. Elijah's physical contact with the child signifies a deep intercession, similar to how Jesus would later touch and heal the sick.<p><b>and cried out to the LORD</b><br>Elijah's cry to the LORD demonstrates his reliance on God for the miracle of resurrection. In the Hebrew tradition, crying out to God is a form of fervent prayer, showing both desperation and faith. This reflects the biblical principle that God hears the cries of His people, as seen in the Psalms and throughout the Old Testament. Elijah's prayer is a model of earnest supplication, showing that true prayer involves both words and heartfelt emotion.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD my God</b><br>By addressing God as "my God," Elijah personalizes his relationship with the LORD, indicating a covenantal bond. This phrase underscores the personal faith and trust Elijah has in God, which is a recurring theme in the lives of the prophets. It also highlights the monotheistic belief in the God of Israel, distinguishing Him from the pagan gods of the surrounding nations. This personal address is reminiscent of other biblical figures who called upon God in times of need, such as David and Daniel.<p><b>please let this boy&#8217;s life return to him!&#8221;</b><br>Elijah's request for the boy's life to return is a direct appeal for resurrection, a rare and significant event in the Old Testament. This miracle prefigures the resurrection power of Jesus Christ, who would later raise the dead, including Himself. The request for life to return emphasizes the belief in God as the giver and sustainer of life, a theme that runs throughout Scripture. This plea also reflects the compassion and mercy of God, who responds to the prayers of His faithful servants. Elijah's successful intercession foreshadows the ultimate victory over death through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his powerful prayers and miracles.

The idea in this passage (as in <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm" title="And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.">2Kings 4:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.">2Kings 13:21</a>, and, perhaps, <a href="/acts/20-10.htm" title="And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.">Acts 20:10</a>) clearly is of a certain healing "virtue," attaching in measure to the person of the prophets, as without measure it belonged to our Lord Himself (<a href="/context/luke/8-45.htm" title="And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you and press you, and say you, Who touched me?">Luke 8:45-46</a>). But it is to be noted that in the case of the prophet, the power to heal or raise up is made distinctly conditional on prayer, "the Lord heard the voice of Elijah."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> -<span class="cmt_word">And he stretched himself</span> [marg. <span class="accented">measured</span> himself, but Gesenius holds that <span class="accented">stretch out</span> is the primary meaning of the root] <span class="cmt_word">upon the child</span> [cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34</a>. The commentators are again at variance as to whether these words imply the use of natural means or not. Those who hold that the child was dead naturally adopt the negative, and some (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>.) compare with it the action of our Lord in the case of the blind, deaf and dumb (<a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>; <a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6, 7</a>). But surely the circumstances and the purpose alike, in these latter cases, were entirely different. The object of the touch, of anointing the eyes, etc., in these cases of healing, appears to have been to awaken a sufficient faith - without which "He could do no miracle" (<a href="/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>) - in men whose infirmities of blindness, deafness, etc., prevented their attaining faith through the ordinary channels of seeing and hearing the merciful and gracious Son of man. But here the child, if not dead, was senseless. We are driven, therefore, to the belief that the prophet "used rational means for warming and revivifying" the child, "not with the hope that of themselves they would prove effectual, but in the sure confidence that God, in answer to his weeping supplication, would impart supernatural force to the natural human agencies," Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">three times</span> [Not only in his prayer but also in this triple repetition do we recognize Elijah's profound conviction that only by the Almighty power of God could the child be restored, and that whatever means were used, God alone could make them effectual. For three is the number and signature of the Godheads" die eigentlieh gottliche Zahl, die Signatur des gottlichen Wesens" (Bahr, Symb. 1:143). Hence it is, <span class="accented">inter alia</span>, that "the calling upon the name of Jehovah in the old covenant" - he might have added, "and in the new;" cf. <a href="/mark/14-39.htm">Mark 14:39, 41</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-8.htm">2 Corinthians 12:8</a> - "was a threefold act:" <a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10, 13</a>; <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a> (Bahr).

Massillon's graphic language (vol. 1. p. 91, ed. 1858), showing the contrast between Elijah's procedure and that of our blessed Lord (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a>; <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>), is worth citing here: "Elie ressuscite des morts, il est vrai; mais il est oblige de se coucher plusieurs fois sur le corps de l'enfant qu'il ressuscite; il souffle, il se retrecit, it s'agite; on voit bien qu'il invoque une puissance etrangere; qu'il rappelle de l'empire de ta mort une ame qui n'est pas soumise a savoix, et qu'il n'est pas lui-meme le maitre de la mort et de la vie: Jesus-Christ ressuscite les morts comme il fait les actions les plus communes; il parle en maitre a ceux qui dorment d'un sommeil eternel, et l'on sent bien qu'il est le Dieu des morts comme des vivants, jamais plus tranquille que lorsqu'il opere les plus grandes choses."] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/17-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he stretched himself out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1444;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;m&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
