The purchase of the hill from Shemer indicates a legal and formal acquisition, which was common in ancient Near Eastern practices. The name "Shemer" is preserved in the name of the city, Samaria, suggesting the importance of lineage and heritage in naming conventions. This act of buying land reflects the political and strategic importance of the location, as Samaria would become the capital of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>for two talents of silver</b><br>The price of two talents of silver signifies a substantial investment, indicating the value of the land. A talent was a large unit of weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms, making this a significant sum. This transaction underscores the economic practices of the time and the importance of silver as a medium of exchange. The investment in Samaria highlights its anticipated role as a central hub for governance and trade.<p><b>and built a city there</b><br>The construction of a city on this hill demonstrates a strategic move to establish a new political and administrative center. Building a city involved significant resources and labor, reflecting the king's intention to create a lasting legacy. The location on a hill provided natural defenses, which was a common consideration in ancient city planning. This city would later become a focal point in the history of Israel, serving as the capital of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>calling it Samaria after the name of Shemer</b><br>Naming the city Samaria after Shemer, the original owner of the hill, reflects a common practice of honoring previous landowners or significant figures. This naming also serves to legitimize the new city by connecting it to its past. Samaria would become synonymous with the Northern Kingdom, playing a crucial role in its history and identity. The name Samaria is mentioned frequently in the Bible, often in the context of the kingdom's political and spiritual challenges.<p><b>who had owned the hill</b><br>The mention of Shemer as the original owner emphasizes the continuity of land ownership and the importance of heritage. This detail provides a historical anchor for the narrative, linking the new city to its past. The acknowledgment of Shemer's ownership highlights the legal and cultural practices of land transactions in ancient Israel. This connection to the past would have been significant for the inhabitants of Samaria, grounding their new capital in a sense of historical continuity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>The sixth king of Israel, who reigned after Zimri and established a new capital for the Northern Kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemer.htm">Shemer</a></b><br>The original owner of the hill that Omri purchased to build the city of Samaria.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The city built by Omri, which became the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_talents_of_silver.htm">Two Talents of Silver</a></b><br>The price paid by Omri for the hill, indicating a significant investment in establishing a new capital.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill_of_samaria.htm">The Hill of Samaria</a></b><br>The strategic location chosen by Omri for its defensibility and central position in the Northern Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_foundations.htm">The Importance of Foundations</a></b><br>Omri's decision to establish Samaria as the capital shows the importance of laying strong foundations.

Possibly the seeds of disaffection may have still lurked in Tirzah, the place of Zimri's conspiracy, and (as has been conjectured) of Tibni's rival power. But the site of Samaria must have been chosen by a soldier's eye. Its Hebrew name (<span class= "ital">Shomeron</span>) means a "watch-tower," and may well have had a double derivation, from its natural position, as well as from its owner's name. Its position was one of great beauty, and, in the warfare of those days, of singular strength, as is shown by the long sieges which it withstood (<a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm" title="And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.">1Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2Kings 6:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm" title="Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.">2Kings 17:5</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/18-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.">2Kings 18:9-10</a>). It lay north-west of Shechem, on an isolated hill with precipitous sides, rising in the middle of a basin of the hills of Ephraim, not far from the edge of the maritime plain, and commanding a view of the sea. Its history vindicated the sagacity of its founder. Even after its destruction and depopulation by the Assyrians, it seems to have revived, for Alexander took it on his invasion of Palestine, and placed a Greek colony there. Again destroyed by John Hyrcanus, it was rebuilt by Herod, and called <span class= "ital">Sebaste</span>, in honour of Augustus. In the Assyrian inscriptions it is known as Beth-Khumri ("the house of Omri").<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">And he bought</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, after the six years just mentioned. During the four years of anarchy Omri would seem to have retained possession of the capital which he had taken (ver. 18) on Zimri's death. But the palace being burnt and the defences perhaps weakened by the siege, he determined, rather than rebuild it, to found a capital elsewhere] <span class="cmt_word">the hill Samaria</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Shomeron</span>, called by Herod <span class="accented">Sebaste</span>, whence its modern name <span class="accented">Sebustieh</span>. In his selection of Samaria for the seat of government, Omri acted with singular judgment. It has been said that "Shechem is the natural capital of Palestine," and no doubt it enjoys a commanding position and great advantages, but Samaria has even superior recommendations. It is a site with which no traveller can fail to be deeply impressed. Even Van de Velde, who says, "I do not agree with Dr. Robinson and other writers who follow him that the mountain of Samaria presents so admirable a combination of strength, fertility, and beauty, that the like is hardly to be found in Palestine" (vol. 1. pp. 374, 375), nevertheless readily allows its superiority to Tirzah, and remarks on the strength of its position. "Many travellers have expressed a conviction that the spot was in most respects much preferable to the site of Jerusalem" (Kitto). It is a large oval or oblong mound, with a level surface, adapted for buildings, with steep sides to make its position impregnable, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. "Samaria is in a position of great strength., and must before the invention of gunpowder have been almost impregnable. It stands some 400 feet above the valley, the sides of the hill being steep and terraced in every direction for cultivation, or perhaps for defensive purposes.. broad and open valleys stretch north and south, and the hill is thus almost isolated," Conder, p. 47, who adds, "Strategical reasons may be supposed to have dictated the choice of the capital of Omri, for on the north the hill commands the main road to Jezreel over a steep pass, on the west it dominates the road to the coast, and on the east that to the Jordan" (p. 49). Grove (Dict. Bib. 3:1099) speaks of "the singular beauty of the spot," and Stanley ("Jewish Church" it. p. 284) justly sees in the selection of this spot a proof of Omri's sagacity. But perhaps the best proof is that which the subsequent history supplies. Shechem and Tirzah had each been tried, and each in turn had been abandoned. But Samaria continued to be the capital so long as the kingdom lasted] <span class="cmt_word">of Shemer for two talents of silver</span> [variously estimated at &pound;500 and &pound;800. This purchase, obviously of the freehold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in perpetuity, was in contravention of the law of <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>. David had bought the threshing floor of Ornan, but that was <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from a Jebusite, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> for a high religious purpose (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). <p>It has been suggested that this purchase may have inspired Ahab with the idea of buying the vineyard of Naboth], and built on [Heb. <span class="accented">built</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the hill and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</span> [It is not improbable that the vendor bargained that the land should retain his name (cf. <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>). The reluctance of the Israelite to part with his patrimony, even to the king, is brought out very strikingly in ch. 21. Shemer, in selling his choice parcel of land for a capital, might well wish to connect his name with it. The fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">watch mountain</span> (Gesen.), and that we should have expected a name formed from Shemer to take the form <span class="accented">Shimron - Shomeron</span> would strictly imply an original <span class="accented">Shomer</span> - is not by any means a proof that our historian is at fault in his derivation. For, in the first place, the names Shomer and Shemer are used of the same person in <a href="/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32, 34</a>. And secondly, nothing would be more in accordance with Jewish ideas than that Omri, in naming the hill after its owner, should give a turn to the word which would also express at the same time its characteristic feature. A pun, or play upon word, was the form which wit assumed amongst the Semitic races (as, indeed, is the case still, see Conder, p. 801), and the form <span class="accented">Shomeron</span> would at once perpetuate the memory of Shemer, and express the hope and purpose of Omri. It is a curious fact that the later Samaritans did play upon this very word, representing themselves as <span class="accented">guardians</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) of the law (Ewald). The Greek form of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, would seem to have been derived through the Chaldee <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> as found in <a href="/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10, 17</a>.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/16-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He bought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1511;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;qen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
