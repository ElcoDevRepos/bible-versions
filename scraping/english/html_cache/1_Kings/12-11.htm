Solomon's extensive building projects, including the temple and his palace, required significant labor and resources, leading to a heavy burden on the people of Israel. The "yoke" symbolizes the forced labor and high taxes that the Israelites endured. This context is crucial for understanding the people's discontent and their request for relief from Rehoboam, Solomon's son. The concept of a "yoke" is also used elsewhere in Scripture to describe oppression or servitude, such as in <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>.<p><b>I will add to your yoke</b><br>Rehoboam's response to the people's plea for lighter burdens reveals his intention to increase their oppression rather than alleviate it. This decision reflects a lack of wisdom and understanding of leadership, contrasting sharply with the wisdom for which Solomon was renowned. The phrase indicates a continuation and intensification of the policies that had already caused dissatisfaction among the Israelites. This decision ultimately leads to the division of the kingdom, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jeroboam in <a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31-35</a>.<p><b>Whereas my father scourged you with whips</b><br>The use of "whips" here is metaphorical, representing the harsh treatment and strict enforcement of labor under Solomon's rule. It suggests a level of severity in the administration of his policies. The imagery of being "scourged" evokes the idea of punishment and suffering, which the people experienced under the heavy demands placed upon them. This metaphor is consistent with the biblical theme of leaders who fail to serve their people with justice and compassion, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>.<p><b>I will scourge you with scorpions.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The term "scorpions" intensifies the imagery of punishment and suffering, suggesting an even harsher regime than that of Solomon. Scorpions, known for their painful sting, symbolize severe and cruel treatment. This hyperbolic language underscores Rehoboam's harshness and insensitivity to the people's plight. The choice of "scorpions" over "whips" indicates a significant escalation in the severity of oppression. This decision leads to the fulfillment of God's judgment on the house of David, as the kingdom is divided, with Jeroboam ruling over the northern tribes. The division of the kingdom is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, illustrating the consequences of unwise and oppressive leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel who succeeded his father.

Perhaps it is safer to understand it as a figure of speech, although the scorpion, unlike the serpent, is little like, or adapted to use as, a lash. Probably it was in the <span class="accented">pain</span> the whip caused that the resemblance lay (<a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>).
