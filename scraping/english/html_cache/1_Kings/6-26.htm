In the tabernacle and later in Solomon's Temple, cherubim were depicted as guardians of sacred spaces. Their presence in the temple signifies the holiness and divine protection of the area. The cherubim's role as guardians is reminiscent of their placement at the entrance of the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), symbolizing the separation between the divine and the profane. The cherubim in the temple were crafted from olive wood and overlaid with gold, emphasizing their importance and the sacredness of their function.<p><b>was ten cubits.</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making each cherub approximately 15 feet or 4.5 meters tall. This significant height underscores the grandeur and majesty of the temple, reflecting the glory of God whom the temple was built to honor. The size of the cherubim also indicates the importance of the Holy of Holies, where they were placed, as the innermost and most sacred part of the temple. The dimensions of the cherubim can be compared to the grandeur of other ancient Near Eastern temples, where large statues often symbolized divine presence and power. The cherubim's size and placement within the temple can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, bridging the gap between the divine and the earthly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's vision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_in_jerusalem.htm">The Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy place constructed by Solomon as a dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant and a center for worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings depicted in the Holy of Holies, symbolizing the presence and majesty of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_of_holies.htm">Holy of Holies</a></b><br>The innermost and most sacred area of the temple where the Ark of the Covenant was placed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_cherubim.htm">Symbolism of the Cherubim</a></b><br>The cherubim in the temple symbolize God's holiness and the reverence due to Him.

Verse 26 sits in the section (vv. 23-28) that describes two massive cherubim standing inside the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.<p>- These figures are not decorative trinkets; they stand over the ark of the covenant, echoing the golden cherubim on the mercy seat in <a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-20</a>.<p>- Their presence points to the throne of God and His nearness to His people, as later pictured in <a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a> and <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The height of each cherub&#8221;</b><p>- Scripture stresses that each cherub was individually measured. No one was bigger or smaller; they were equal in stature before the ark.<p>- By specifying &#8220;each,&#8221; the text rebuffs any idea of hierarchy among these celestial beings, underscoring the singular greatness of the God they attend (<a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2-3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>).<p>- The equal height reinforces that God&#8217;s glory, not the size of the servants, is the focus (<a href="/psalms/97-9.htm">Psalm 97:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Was ten cubits&#8221;</b><p>- A cubit is roughly 18 inches (45 cm), placing each cherub at about 15 feet (4.5 m) tall&#8212;taller than a giraffe&#8217;s shoulders.<p>- <a href="/2_chronicles/3-11.htm">2 Chronicles 3:11-13</a> confirms identical measurements, showing harmony between historical accounts.<p>- Ten cubits is exactly half the height of the sanctuary (cf. <a href="/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). Their size fills, but does not overwhelm, the room&#8212;symbolizing that God accommodates His presence to His people (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).<p>- The precise number ten often conveys completeness (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), hinting that the cherubim perfectly fit their God-appointed purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Theological Implications of Size</b><p>- Grandeur: Their towering height draws eyes up, directing worshipers from earthly concerns to heavenly realities (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>).<p>- Protection: Like sentries at a royal throne, they guard the ark, echoing <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> where cherubim keep the way to the tree of life.<p>- Accessibility with awe: The large yet finite size reminds Israel that while God is transcendent (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), He chooses to dwell among them (<a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>).<p>- Foreshadowing: <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a> uses these temple cherubim to prefigure Christ&#8217;s once-for-all atonement, showing that even majestic angelic beings point beyond themselves to the greater glory to come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Practical Takeaways</b><p>- God cares about details; if He records measurements, He cares about the particulars of our obedience (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>- Worship spaces matter; beauty and order can elevate hearts to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>- Angels are impressive, yet they serve; believers should likewise point away from self to the Lord (<a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/6-26.htm">1 Kings 6:26</a> literally states that every cherub in Solomon&#8217;s inner sanctuary stood fifteen feet tall.
