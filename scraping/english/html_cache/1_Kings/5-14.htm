Lebanon was known for its abundant cedar trees, which were highly prized for building. The use of "monthly shifts" indicates a well-structured labor system, allowing workers to rest and maintain their families. This reflects Solomon's wisdom in administration, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>, where his wisdom is described as greater than all the men of the East and Egypt. The number "10,000" signifies a large workforce, emphasizing the scale and importance of the temple project.<p><b>so that they would spend one month in Lebanon and two months at home</b><br>This arrangement shows consideration for the workers' well-being, allowing them to balance work and family life. It reflects the social and cultural values of the time, where family and community were central. The rotation system ensured that the labor force remained strong and motivated. This can be compared to the Sabbath principle in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, where rest is integral to the rhythm of life. It also prefigures the rest offered by Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus invites the weary to find rest in Him.<p><b>And Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor</b><br>Adoniram, also known as Adoram, was a high-ranking official in Solomon's administration, responsible for overseeing the labor force. His role is mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>, highlighting his importance in the kingdom. The term "forced labor" indicates that this was not voluntary service, which can be seen as a precursor to the later division of the kingdom under Rehoboam, as described in <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>. The people's discontent with forced labor contributed to the split, showing the long-term consequences of such policies. This also foreshadows the ultimate liberation from bondage through Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where believers are called to stand firm in the freedom Christ provides.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his wisdom and for building the temple in Jerusalem.

The king therefore &#8220;sent&#8221; workers northward, literally dispatching Israelites across the border to Lebanon&#8217;s forests. Rather than a symbolic gesture, this is the plain historical movement of a labor force charged with felling and transporting timber for the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7</a>). The verse shows Solomon&#8217;s willingness to commit national resources to a God-ordained project (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; 1 Chron 28:10).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In monthly shifts of 10,000 men</b><p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a> tells us there were thirty thousand conscripted laborers.<p>&#8226; Dividing them into three equal shifts demonstrates organization, not chaos&#8212;Solomon&#8217;s wisdom in action (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The size&#8212;10,000&#8212;underscores the magnitude of the temple undertaking (2 Chron 2:17-18).<p>&#8226; The rotation mirrors earlier models of service, such as the priestly courses established by David (1 Chron 24:1-19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that they would spend one month in Lebanon</b><p>A full thirty-day stint allowed a crew to accomplish significant work: cutting, trimming, and assembling rafts of timber to float down the coast (<a href="/1_kings/5-9.htm">1 Kings 5:9</a>).
