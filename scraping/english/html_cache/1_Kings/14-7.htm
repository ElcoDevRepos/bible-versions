Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, is the recipient. His reign began after the division of the united monarchy under Solomon's son, Rehoboam. Jeroboam's rise to power was initially sanctioned by God, but his subsequent actions led to idolatry and sin.<p><b>that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The phrase underscores the authority and sovereignty of God over Israel. Despite the division of the kingdom, God remains the ultimate ruler. This introduction is typical of prophetic messages, affirming that the words are not the prophet's own but are divinely inspired. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>&#8216;I raised you up from among the people</b><br>God's selection of Jeroboam highlights His sovereign choice and ability to elevate individuals for His purposes. Jeroboam was originally a servant of Solomon, indicating that God can call anyone, regardless of their social status, to fulfill His plans. This mirrors other biblical instances where God raises leaders from humble beginnings, such as David from shepherd to king.<p><b>and appointed you ruler over My people Israel.</b><br>This appointment signifies divine authority and responsibility. Jeroboam's rule was part of God's plan to discipline the house of David due to Solomon's idolatry. However, with this appointment came the expectation of faithfulness to God's commandments. The phrase "My people Israel" reflects God's enduring covenant with Israel, despite their disobedience. Jeroboam's failure to lead righteously foreshadows the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The sin of Jeroboam lay in this--that he had had a full probation, with unlimited opportunities, and had deliberately thrown it away, in the vain hope of making surer the kingdom which God's promise had already made sure. The lesson is, indeed, a general one. The resolution to succeed at all hazards, striking out new ways, with no respect for time-honoured laws and principles, is in all revolutions the secret of immediate success and ultimate disaster. But in the Scripture history, here as elsewhere, we are permitted to see the working of God's moral government of the world, unveiled in the inspired declarations of His prophetic messenger.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord Cod of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people</span> [compare <a href="/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm">1 Kings 16:2</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and made thee prince over my people Israel.</span> [God still claims dominion over Israel, despite the schism.
