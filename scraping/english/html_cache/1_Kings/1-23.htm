The context is a time of political tension as Adonijah, David's son, was attempting to seize the throne. The king being informed suggests the importance of Nathan's visit, as Nathan was a trusted prophet and advisor to David. This reflects the protocol and respect for the king's authority in ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Nathan the prophet is here.&#8221;</b><br>Nathan was a significant figure in David's life, known for delivering God's messages, including the rebuke for David's sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>). His presence here underscores the gravity of the situation. Prophets in Israel were seen as God's mouthpieces, and Nathan's involvement highlights the divine interest in the succession of the throne. This moment is pivotal in ensuring Solomon's rightful kingship, aligning with God's covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>And Nathan went in</b><br>Nathan's entrance into the king's presence signifies his role as an intermediary between God and the king. It also reflects the court protocol, where only certain individuals could approach the king directly. Nathan's access to David underscores his high status and the trust David placed in him.<p><b>and bowed facedown before the king.</b><br>Bowing facedown was a customary act of deep respect and submission in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This gesture by Nathan, despite his prophetic authority, shows his acknowledgment of David's royal position. It also reflects the cultural norms of showing deference to a king, which was expected in the hierarchical society of ancient Israel. This act of humility by Nathan sets the stage for his important message regarding the succession of the throne.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A key figure in the court of King David, Nathan was a prophet who played a significant role in advising the king and delivering God's messages.
