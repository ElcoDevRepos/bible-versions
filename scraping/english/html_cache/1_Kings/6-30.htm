Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was used extensively in the construction of the temple, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. This act of overlaying with gold is reminiscent of the tabernacle's construction in Exodus, where gold was also a prominent material. The use of gold in the temple underscores the idea that nothing but the best should be offered to God, highlighting the reverence and honor due to Him. This opulence also prefigures the heavenly Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the city is made of pure gold, symbolizing the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people.<p><b>in both the inner and outer sanctuaries</b><br>The inner sanctuary, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. Only the high priest could enter this area, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement, signifying the separation between God and man due to sin. The outer sanctuary, or the Holy Place, was where the priests performed daily rituals and offerings. The overlaying of both sanctuaries with gold indicates the holiness and set-apart nature of the entire temple complex. This dual sanctification points to the comprehensive nature of God's holiness and the need for purity in worship. The distinction between the inner and outer sanctuaries also foreshadows the work of Christ, who, through His sacrifice, tore the veil separating the Holy of Holies, granting believers direct access to God as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.
