King Solomon, son of David, was chosen to build the temple, fulfilling God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The temple served as the central place of worship for the Israelites and housed the Ark of the Covenant. It symbolized God's presence among His people and was a place for sacrifices and offerings. The temple's construction was a monumental task, requiring skilled labor and materials from various regions, including Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>).<p><b>was sixty cubits long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Therefore, the temple's length was approximately 90 feet or 27 meters. This dimension reflects the grandeur and significance of the temple as a place of worship. The length of the temple can be compared to the tabernacle, which was 30 cubits long (<a href="/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15-30</a>), indicating the temple's greater permanence and importance.<p><b>twenty cubits wide</b><br>The width of the temple was about 30 feet or 9 meters. This dimension, along with the others, highlights the temple's rectangular shape, similar to the tabernacle but on a larger scale. The temple's design was divinely inspired, with specific instructions given to Solomon, ensuring it met the requirements for worship and sacrifice (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11-19</a>).<p><b>and thirty cubits high</b><br>The height of the temple was approximately 45 feet or 13.5 meters. This height allowed for a majestic and imposing structure, visible from a distance and symbolizing the exaltation of God. The temple's height also accommodated the two-story design, with chambers surrounding the main hall.

The measurements reveal God&#8217;s order, Israel&#8217;s maturity, and a forward-looking symbol of His desire to dwell with His people forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The length.</span>--By comparison with <a href="/context/exodus/26-16.htm" title="Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board.">Exodus 26:16-23</a>, we find that the Temple itself was in all its proportions an exact copy of the Tabernacle, each dimension being doubled, and the whole, therefore, in cubical contents, eight times the size. It was, therefore--whatever measure we take for the cubit--a small building. Taking the usual calculation of eighteen inches for the cubit, the whole would be ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high--not larger than a good-sized parish church, and in proportion not unlike a church of Gothic construction. It is, indeed, curious to note that this likeness is carried out in the existence of the porch (which is even represented in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2Chronicles 3:4</a> as rising into a lofty entrance tower), the division of the house into two parts, like a nave and chancel, the provision of something like aisles (though opening outwards) and of clerestory windows, and the high pitch of the roof. This resemblance is probably not mere coincidence; for in the old Freemasonry, which had a great influence on mediaeval architecture, the plan of Solomon's Temple was taken in all its details as a sacred guide. The "Oracle" or Most Holy place, was lower than the rest, forming an exact cube of thirty feet; the height of the Holy place (sixty feet long and thirty feet wide) is not given, but was probably the same, so that there would be an upper chamber over the whole under the roof--which, like that of the Tabernacle, appears to have been a high-pitched roof--fifteen feet high along the central beam, with sloping sides. This is apparently alluded to in <a href="/2_chronicles/3-9.htm" title="And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.">2Chronicles 3:9</a>, and possibly in <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>, and in the remark of Josephus, "There was another building erected over it, equal in its measures." The Temple was, in fact, only a shrine for the ministering priests--the outer court, or courts, being the place for the great assembly of the congregation--and it relied for magnificence not on size, but on costliness of material and wealth of decoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, not the whole structure, but the main building, exclusive of porch (ver. 3) and side chambers (ver. 5)] <span class="cmt_word">which</span> <span class="cmt_word">king Solomon built for the Lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits</span> [But what was the length of the cubit?

Probably at first it signified, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. "The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than <span class="accented">sixteen</span> inches. He says, "Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that "the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers" (pp. 187-8)] <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</span> [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a <span class="accented">very</span> small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met <span class="accented">within</span> it, but the worship was offered <span class="accented">towards</span> it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
