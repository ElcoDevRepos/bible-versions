It was where Jacob had his vision of the ladder reaching to heaven (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). By setting up a golden calf here, Jeroboam was attempting to establish a rival religious center to Jerusalem, which was in the southern kingdom of Judah. This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and echoed the sin of the golden calf at Mount Sinai (Exodus 32). The choice of Bethel was strategic, as it was close to the border of the northern and southern kingdoms, making it accessible for the people of Israel. This act of idolatry was a significant turning point, leading Israel into sin and away from the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>and the other in Dan</b><br>Dan was located in the northernmost part of Israel, making it a convenient location for those living far from Jerusalem. The city of Dan had a history of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where the tribe of Dan set up a carved image. By placing a golden calf here, Jeroboam was ensuring that his subjects would not travel to Jerusalem to worship, thus consolidating his political power. This action fulfilled the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>), which warned of the division of the kingdom due to Solomon's idolatry. The establishment of these calves in Bethel and Dan was a significant factor in the spiritual decline of the northern kingdom, leading to its eventual downfall and exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

First, both these places were in some sort sanctuaries already. Bethel was already a <span class="accented">makom</span>, or holy place, in the days of Abraham; was consecrated by the visions and altar of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11-19</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1, 7, 15</a>), and by the ark having been there (<a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-28</a>, Hebrews; cf. Jos., Ant., 5:02.10). And though Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="/judges/18-29.htm">Judges 18:29</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>) can hardly have had as sacred a character as the "house of God and the gate of heaven" (<a href="/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>) had, still it had its shrine and its schismatic priesthood. A grandson of Moses (<a href="/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13</a>, true reading) had ministered there, and his sons were the priests of Dan still. Secondly, these localities would suit the convenience of his subjects, being respectively at the southern and northern extremities of the kingdom. And this, no doubt, was one reason why Dan was chosen in preference to other places, such as Shiloh, which, though more sacred, were less conveniently situated. A sanctuary at Dan would save the northern tribes many tedious journeys. It should be remarked that Bethel properly belonged to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13, 22</a>), though it was also on the border of Ephraim; and it has been suggested that it was Jeroboam's selection of this place as a seat of the calf worship decided the tribe of Benjamin to follow the lead of Judah. But the narrative seems to imply that their choice had been made at an earlier period (ver. 21), and the city would seem to have been long in the possession of the house of Joseph (<a href="/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a>). It is now known as <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, and is one of the most naked and dreary spots in Palestine.
