Bronze casting was a sophisticated process, indicating the advanced metallurgical skills of the period. The capitals, or decorative tops of the pillars, were likely ornate, reflecting the grandeur of Solomon's temple. Bronze is often associated with judgment in the Bible, as seen in the bronze altar (<a href="/exodus/27.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>), symbolizing the need for purification and atonement.<p><b>to set on top of the pillars</b><br>The pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, stood at the entrance of Solomon's temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). They were not structural but symbolic, representing stability and strength. The placement of the capitals on these pillars highlights the importance of beauty and artistry in worship spaces, pointing to the glory and majesty of God. The pillars' names suggest themes of establishment and strength, which are central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>each capital five cubits high</b><br>A cubit is approximately 18 inches, making each capital about 7.5 feet high. The height of the capitals adds to the imposing presence of the pillars, emphasizing the temple's grandeur. The number five can symbolize God's grace and favor, as seen in the five offerings in Leviticus and the five-fold ministry in <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>.

By crowning them, the Lord visually proclaimed His support for His people.<p>&#8226; The temple entrance therefore displayed a message: those who enter rely on God&#8217;s established promises (<a href="/psalms/118-19.htm">Psalm 118:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Architecturally, capitals transfer weight and finish the column; spiritually, they point upward to the glory above (<a href="/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each capital five cubits high</b><p>Each capital stood &#8220;five cubits high&#8221; (roughly seven and a half feet).<p>&#8226; The specific measurement underscores historical accuracy; Scripture records real dimensions (<a href="/genesis/6-15.htm">Genesis 6:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Five often signifies grace in biblical patterns (e.g., the five offerings in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1-7</a>; Jesus feeding thousands with five loaves, <a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-21</a>). Grace literally crowned the pillars that welcomed worshipers.<p>&#8226; The considerable height ensured they could be seen from afar, broadcasting God&#8217;s magnificence (<a href="/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5-6</a>; <a href="/psalms/48-9.htm">Psalm 48:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/7-16.htm">1 Kings 7:16</a> shows that God cared about every ornamental detail of His house.

See <a href="/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-22.htm">Jeremiah 52:22</a>. A much more important question is whether the chapiter (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> same word, akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, crown) of four cubits mentioned in ver. 19 is to be understood as a part of this chapiter, or something additional and superposed, the entablature, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> The former appears the more probable. See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, "the bowls of the chapiters" (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>), and the word "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called "cushion capital" in Norman architecture. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
