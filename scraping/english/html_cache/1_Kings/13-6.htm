The king, Jeroboam, had initially reacted with hostility towards the man of God, who had come from Judah to prophesy against the altar at Bethel. Jeroboam's response here shows a shift from anger to a plea for help, highlighting the power and authority of the prophetic word. This interaction underscores the theme of divine authority over earthly kings, a recurring motif in the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me</b><br>Jeroboam's request for intercession reveals his recognition of the man of God's connection to the divine. The phrase "the LORD your God" suggests a distance between Jeroboam and the God of Israel, possibly indicating his estrangement due to idolatry. Intercession is a significant biblical theme, seen in figures like Moses and Abraham, who prayed on behalf of others. This request also foreshadows the mediatory role of Christ, who intercedes for humanity.<p><b>that my hand may be restored.&#8221;</b><br>The king's hand had withered as a sign of divine judgment when he attempted to seize the man of God. The request for restoration is both physical and symbolic, representing a desire for healing and a return to favor. The withered hand can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual decay, and its restoration signifies repentance and divine mercy. This act of healing prefigures the miracles of Jesus, who often restored physical ailments as a sign of spiritual renewal.<p><b>So the man of God interceded with the LORD,</b><br>The man of God's willingness to intercede demonstrates obedience and compassion, reflecting the character of true prophets who act as intermediaries between God and people. This act of intercession is a powerful reminder of the efficacy of prayer and the importance of righteous individuals in mediating God's grace. It also highlights the role of prophets in the Old Testament as conduits of divine will.<p><b>and the king&#8217;s hand was restored to him as it was before.</b><br>The restoration of the king's hand is a testament to God's power and mercy. It serves as a confirmation of the man of God's prophetic authority and the truth of his message. This miraculous healing parallels the restorative miracles of Jesus, who often healed to demonstrate the coming of God's kingdom. The phrase "as it was before" emphasizes complete restoration, symbolizing the possibility of redemption and renewal for those who turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
