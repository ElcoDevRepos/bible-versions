The palace, likely located in Samaria, serves as a symbol of Ahab's royal status. This action follows his unsuccessful attempt to acquire Naboth's vineyard, highlighting his inability to exercise his kingly power to fulfill personal desires. The palace, a place of luxury and decision-making, contrasts with Ahab's emotional state.<p><b>sullen and angry</b><br>Ahab's emotional response reveals his immaturity and self-centeredness. His sullen and angry demeanor reflects a heart not aligned with God's will, as he prioritizes personal gain over justice and righteousness. This behavior is reminiscent of other biblical figures who reacted poorly when their desires were thwarted, such as Cain in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-6</a>.<p><b>because Naboth the Jezreelite had told him</b><br>Naboth, a resident of Jezreel, is a man of integrity who upholds the laws of inheritance given by God. Jezreel, a city with historical and prophetic significance, later becomes a site of judgment against Ahab's house (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30-37</a>). Naboth's refusal is rooted in obedience to God's commands regarding land inheritance (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&#8221;</b><br>Naboth's statement underscores the importance of land inheritance in Israelite culture, as land was a divine gift and a symbol of God's covenant with His people. The inheritance laws were designed to maintain familial and tribal boundaries, ensuring that land remained within the family (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>). Naboth's refusal is an act of faithfulness to God's law, contrasting with Ahab's disregard for divine commandments.<p><b>He lay down on his bed,</b><br>Ahab's retreat to his bed signifies a withdrawal from his kingly duties and responsibilities. This act of lying down can be seen as a form of escapism, avoiding the reality of his situation. It also reflects a lack of leadership and maturity, as he chooses to sulk rather than address the issue constructively.<p><b>turned his face away,</b><br>Turning his face away symbolizes Ahab's refusal to engage with those around him, including his advisors and possibly God. This action indicates a rejection of counsel and a desire to isolate himself in his disappointment. It is a physical manifestation of his inner turmoil and unwillingness to confront his own shortcomings.<p><b>and refused to eat.</b><br>Ahab's refusal to eat is a sign of his deep dissatisfaction and emotional distress. In biblical times, fasting was often associated with mourning or repentance, but here it is a petulant response to not getting his way. This behavior contrasts with the biblical call to seek God's guidance and strength in times of trouble, as seen in the lives of faithful leaders like David (<a href="/psalms/42-11.htm">Psalm 42:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his weak character and susceptibility to his wife Jezebel's influence.

Instead of dealing with disappointment before the LORD (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>), he nurses it in private, allowing covetousness (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>) to fester.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sullen and angry</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who does not control his temper&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Anger unchecked blinds the heart (<a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>); Ahab&#8217;s pout is not mere moodiness&#8212;it signals rebellion against God&#8217;s law and providence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because Naboth the Jezreelite had told him</b><p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s wrath is directed at a righteous man who simply obeyed Scripture.

Naboth stands on God&#8217;s word; Ahab collapses over thwarted lust. The verse warns that unchecked coveting distorts judgment, poisons relationships, and opens the door for greater evil, while also affirming that fidelity to God&#8217;s commands&#8212;no matter the pressure&#8212;remains the believer&#8217;s safe ground.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab came into his house</span> [At Samaria, as we gather from vers. 18, 14, 16, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">heavy and displeased</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">sullen and angry</span>; same words as in <a href="/1_kings/20-43.htm">1 Kings 20:43</a>. Ewald thinks that we have here a clear reference to that passage] <span class="cmt_word">because of the word which Naboth the Jezreellte had spoken to him: for</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed</span> [Rawlinson understands this to mean the couch on which the Orientals recline at meals.

But "<span class="accented">his</span> bed" seems rather to point to his private chamber; see on ver. 5], <span class="cmt_word">and turned away his face</span> [The Vulgate adds <span class="accented">ad parietem</span>. Cf. <a href="/2_kings/20-2.htm">2 Kings 20:2</a>; from which place it may have been unconsciously introduced here], <span class="cmt_word">and would eat no bread.</span> [Keil contends that" this childish mode of giving expression to his displeasure shows very clearly that Ahab was a man sold under sin (ver. 20), who only wanted the requisite energy to display the wickedness of his heart in vigorous action;" but whether this is a just inference from these words may well be questioned. It rather shows that so little did he meditate evil that he accepted the refusal of Naboth as conclusive, and gave way to childish grief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Ahab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
