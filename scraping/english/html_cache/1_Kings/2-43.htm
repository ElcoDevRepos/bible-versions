Oaths were solemn promises made before God, and breaking them was considered a serious offense. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/2.htm">1 Kings 2</a>, Solomon is addressing Shimei, who had sworn an oath to Solomon not to leave Jerusalem. The breaking of an oath to the LORD was not just a personal failure but a violation of a covenant with God, reflecting the gravity of disobedience. This echoes the broader biblical theme of faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>, where vows to the LORD must be fulfilled. The emphasis on keeping one's word is also seen in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where He speaks about the integrity of one's promises.<p><b>and the command that I gave you?</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the specific command Solomon gave to Shimei, which was to remain in Jerusalem under penalty of death if he left. This command was a test of Shimei's loyalty and obedience. The historical context here is Solomon's consolidation of his kingdom, ensuring that potential threats, like Shimei who had previously cursed David, were neutralized. The command reflects the king's authority and the expectation of obedience to royal decrees. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where God's commands are to be followed, as seen in the covenantal laws given to Israel. The failure to obey Solomon's command is symbolic of the broader human tendency to disobey divine authority, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, from Adam and Eve's disobedience in Genesis to Israel's repeated failures to keep God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel at this time.
