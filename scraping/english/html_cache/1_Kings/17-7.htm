Elijah had been staying by the brook Cherith, where God had provided for him during the drought. The passage of time suggests a period of testing and reliance on God's provision. It reflects the patience and endurance required in faith, as seen in other biblical narratives such as the Israelites' journey in the wilderness.<p><b>however, the brook dried up</b><br>The drying up of the brook signifies a change in circumstances and a new phase in Elijah's journey. This event is a direct consequence of the drought that Elijah himself had prophesied. It serves as a reminder of the reality of God's judgment on the land due to the people's idolatry and disobedience. The drying brook also symbolizes the temporary nature of earthly provisions and the need to trust in God's continued guidance and provision.<p><b>because there had been no rain in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy of a drought as a judgment against Israel's worship of Baal, a deity associated with rain and fertility. The lack of rain underscores the impotence of false gods and the sovereignty of the God of Israel. It also sets the stage for Elijah's subsequent encounter with the widow of Zarephath, where God's miraculous provision will be further demonstrated. The drought is a physical manifestation of spiritual barrenness, calling the nation to repentance and return to the true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is central to this account.

Elijah is experiencing that same sovereign timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>however</b><p>&#8226; This single word turns the narrative: life under God&#8217;s care is not static. Even divinely ordered seasons shift.<p>&#8226; Scripture regularly couples assurance with impending trial&#8212;&#8220;In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); &#8220;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon you&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s story teaches that transition points are neither accidents nor evidence of divine neglect; they are invitations to deeper trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the brook dried up</b><p>&#8226; The phrase is literal: the watercourse that had sustained Elijah is now dust. God sometimes lets tangible supports disappear so that faith looks past the gift to the Giver.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He turns rivers into desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-33.htm">Psalm 107:33</a>). The same hand that filled the brook has now emptied it.<p>&#8226; Such moments expose idols of security. Israel had clung to Baal, the storm-god; God demonstrates His supremacy by shutting down every supposed source of supply (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the dried brook will push Elijah toward Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>), where an even greater miracle awaits. Closed doors steer obedient servants to God&#8217;s next assignment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because there had been no rain in the land</b><p>&#8226; The cause is crystal-clear. Elijah himself had proclaimed, &#8220;There will be neither dew nor rain &#8230; except at my word&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>). The brook&#8217;s fate confirms the prophet&#8217;s earlier message.<p>&#8226; Heaven&#8217;s shut windows are covenant discipline: &#8220;Then the LORD&#8217;s anger will burn against you, and He will shut the heavens so that it will not rain&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-17.htm">Deuteronomy 11:17</a>).<p>&#8226; James highlights this very episode: &#8220;Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>). God&#8217;s word, God&#8217;s servant, and God&#8217;s weather all speak with one voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s dried-up brook is no accident. After a divinely appointed season of quiet provision, God allows the water to vanish, proving His sovereign timing, exposing Israel&#8217;s false securities, and moving His prophet to the next stage of ministry. The scene underscores that the Lord who gives can withdraw, yet He remains the faithful Source behind every shifting circumstance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">and it came to pass</span> after awhile, [Heb. <span class="accented">at the end of days</span>.
