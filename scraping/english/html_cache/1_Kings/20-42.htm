This particular prophet is speaking to King Ahab of Israel. Prophets often confronted kings with messages of judgment or guidance, as seen with Nathan and David (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>). The role of the prophet was crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase indicates divine authority. The prophet is not speaking on his own behalf but delivering a message directly from God. This formula is common in prophetic literature, emphasizing that the message is not human opinion but divine revelation, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8216;Because you have let slip from your hand</b><br>This phrase refers to King Ahab's failure to execute Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram, whom God had delivered into his hands. Ahab's decision to release Ben-Hadad was an act of disobedience to God's command. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where leaders are held accountable for their actions, such as Saul's disobedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<p><b>the man I had devoted to destruction,</b><br>The concept of "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) involves a divine command to completely destroy something or someone as an act of judgment. This is seen in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). Ahab's failure to carry out this command demonstrates a lack of reverence for God's holiness and justice.<p><b>your life will be exchanged for his life,</b><br>This is a pronouncement of divine justice, reflecting the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). Ahab's life is now forfeit because he spared Ben-Hadad's life. This principle underscores the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands and the inevitable consequences of sin.<p><b>and your people for his people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The judgment extends beyond Ahab to the people of Israel, indicating that the king's actions have national repercussions. This reflects the corporate nature of Israel's covenant relationship with God, where the leader's actions could bring blessings or curses upon the nation (Deuteronomy 28). It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Ahab's dynasty and the suffering of Israel due to his unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A messenger of God who delivers the divine judgment to King Ahab.

In either case it had no right to stand unauthorised between God's judgment and him on whom it was pronounced; for even soft-heartedness, as in the case of Eli, may be treason to the cause of righteousness. The prophet (like Elisha, in <a href="/2_kings/13-19.htm" title="And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, You should have smitten five or six times; then had you smitten Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall smite Syria but thrice.">2Kings 13:19</a>) speaks partly as a patriot, jealous--and, as the event proved, with a sagacious jealousy--of the lenity which left the deadly enemy of Israel unsubdued; but he speaks also as the representative of God's stern and righteous judgment. which Ahab, after signal deliverance, had treated as of no account. (For the fulfilment of his words, see <a href="/context/1_kings/22-34.htm" title="And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: why he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.">1Kings 22:34-36</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said onto him.

It was probably because of this denunciation (cf. <a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>) that Josephus identifies this prophet with Micaiah, the son of Imlah, "whom Ahab appears to have imprisoned on account of some threatening prophecy (Rawlinson). See <a href="/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9, 26</a>. For the fulfilment o! this prediction see ch. 22. It has seemed to some writers as if Ahab were here very hardly dealt with for merely gratifying s generous impulse, and dealing magnanimously with a conquered foe. Indeed, there are commentators who see in his release of the cruel and insolent tyrant s "trait which does honour to the heart of Ahab." But it is to be remembered, first, that Ahab was not free to do as he liked in this matter. His victories had been won, not by his prowess, by the skill of his generals, or the valour of his soldiers, but by the power of God alone. The war, that is to say, was God's war: it was begun and continued, and should therefore have been ended, in Him. When even the details of the attack had been ordered of God (ver. 14), surely He should have been consulted as to the disposal of the prisoners. The prophet who promised Divine aid might at any rate have been asked - as prophets constantly were in that age (<a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5, 8</a>) - what was the "word of the Lord" concerning Israel's overbearing and inveterate enemy. But Ahab, who had himself played so craven a part (vers. 21, 31), and who had contributed nothing to these great and unhoped-for victories, nevertheless arrogated to himself their fruits, and thereby ignored and dishonoured God. Secondly, if he had so little regard for his own private interests as to liberate such a man as Ben-hadad, he ought, as trustee for the peace and welfare of Israel, to have acted differently. The demand of ver. 6 should have revealed to him the character of the man he had to deal with. And lastly, he was acting in defiance of all the principles and precedents of the Old Testament dispensation. For one great principle of that dispensation was the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>. The king was the authorized dispenser of rewards and punishments, not only to wicked subjects but to aggressive nations. It was his duty to mete out to them the measure they had served to Israel. And the precedents were all in favour of putting such wretches as this Ben-hadad to the sword (<a href="/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a>; <a href="/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). If he had been the first oppressor who fell into the hands of Israel, Ahab might have had some excuse. But with the fate of Agog, of Adonibezek, of Oreb and Zeeb, in his memory, he ought at any rate to have paused and asked counsel of God before taking Ben-hadad into his chariot and sending him away with a covenant of peace, to reappear at no distant period on the scene as the scourge of the Lord's people.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/20-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [the prophet] said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
