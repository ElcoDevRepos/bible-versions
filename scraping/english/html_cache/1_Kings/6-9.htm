The completion of the temple signifies the culmination of a significant period in Israel's history, marking a transition from the tabernacle, a mobile sanctuary, to a permanent dwelling place for God's presence. The temple's construction was a monumental task, taking seven years to complete (<a href="/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), and it symbolized the establishment of Israel as a nation under God's covenant. The temple served as a central place of worship and a symbol of God's dwelling among His people, prefiguring the coming of Christ, who is described as the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<p><b>roofing it with beams and planks of cedar</b><br>The use of cedar wood, particularly from Lebanon, was a sign of wealth and prestige, as cedar was highly valued for its durability and fragrance. This choice of material reflects the temple's significance and the desire to honor God with the finest resources available. The cedar beams and planks also connect to the broader biblical narrative, as cedar was used in the construction of other significant structures, such as David's palace (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>) and the second temple (<a href="/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The use of cedar in the temple's construction can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "Branch" (<a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>), symbolizing strength and eternal life. The temple's roof, made of these materials, provided a covering, pointing to Christ's role as our covering and protection from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

But Mr. Fergussen has alleged some reasons for believing that it was a span or gable roof. It is true that Oriental buildings almost invariably have externally flat(internally arched) roofs. In Palestine, because of the scarcity of timber, no other form is possible. But the temple, as we have seen, was constructed after the model of the tabernacle, and the latter, as the name almost implies, and as necessity would require, had a ridged roof (see Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1453). It does not <span class="accented">necessarily</span> follow, however, as Fergusson assumes, that the temple followed the tabernacle in this respect. It is obvious that when a "<span class="accented">house</span> was built unto the name of the Lord," the form of the tent might be abandoned as inappropriate. It is true that this shape would be consecrated to them by many centuries of use, but it is also possible that in a house it would strike them as altogether <span class="accented">bizarre.</span>] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Solomon] built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
