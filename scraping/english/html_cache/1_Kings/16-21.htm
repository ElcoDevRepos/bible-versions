The division reflects the broader theme of Israel's recurring struggles with unity and faithfulness to God. This internal conflict can be seen as a consequence of the nation's departure from the covenant with God, as warned by prophets like Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>). The division also foreshadows later splits, such as the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12).<p><b>Half of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath as king:</b><br>Tibni, though not as well-known as other biblical figures, represents a faction within Israel that sought leadership apart from the established line. His support indicates significant dissatisfaction with the ruling powers, possibly due to political, economic, or religious reasons. The mention of his father, Ginath, suggests a lineage or family of some standing, though not much is known about them. This division can be compared to other biblical instances where leadership disputes arose, such as the rebellion of Absalom against David (2 Samuel 15).<p><b>and half supported Omri:</b><br>Omri was a military commander who eventually became king and established a new dynasty. His support from half the people suggests he had significant influence and possibly military backing. Omri's reign is notable for establishing Samaria as the capital of Israel, which became a significant city in biblical history. His dynasty, though politically successful, is often criticized in the Bible for leading Israel further into idolatry, as seen in the actions of his son Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). Omri's rise to power can be seen as part of God's permissive will, allowing human choices to unfold while still working towards His ultimate purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tibni_son_of_ginath.htm">Tibni son of Ginath</a></b><br>A contender for the throne of Israel, supported by half of the people.

The northern kingdom has already endured rapid turnovers&#8212;Baasha, Elah, Zimri&#8212;and the nation is weary. This clause grounds the reader in a literal historical moment, showing how sin-driven instability unfolds in real time (cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8-12</a>, another season of quick successions).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people of Israel were divided</b><p>The verse highlights a rupture inside the covenant community, echoing the earlier split between Judah and Israel in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>. That original fracture sprang from idolatry and pride; now a further rift appears for the same reasons. Division is never presented as God&#8217;s desire (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>; <a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>), yet Scripture records it faithfully to warn that rebellion against the Lord breeds factionalism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Half of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath as king</b><p>&#8226; Tibni&#8217;s background is obscure, underscoring how desperate Israel has become; almost anyone seems preferable to the last failed ruler.<p>&#8226; The people &#8220;supported&#8221; him, indicating a human-driven, not God-appointed, choice (contrast <a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a> where the Lord identifies Saul).<p>&#8226; This reflects Judges-like chaos: &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing leaders apart from divine guidance leads to short-lived hopes; Tibni will soon die (<a href="/1_kings/16-22.htm">1 Kings 16:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and half supported Omri</b><p>&#8226; Omri, commander of the army (<a href="/1_kings/16-16.htm">1 Kings 16:16</a>), wields military clout. The people rely on power rather than prayer, repeating the pattern of <a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19-20</a>.<p>&#8226; Though Omri ultimately prevails (<a href="/1_kings/16-23.htm">1 Kings 16:23</a>), God&#8217;s verdict on him is blunt: &#8220;Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, and acted more wickedly than all who were before him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-25.htm">1 Kings 16:25</a>). Earthly success does not equal divine approval (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>; <a href="/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Omri&#8217;s dynasty will birth Ahab, intensifying Israel&#8217;s slide into Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>). The verse therefore foreshadows deeper apostasy whenever leadership arises from popular vote rather than prophetic mandate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21</a> records a literal moment when Israel fractures between Tibni and Omri, illustrating the fruit of continual rebellion. Human schemes replace God&#8217;s choice, producing division, instability, and eventual deeper sin. The verse stands as a sober reminder that unity, security, and righteous leadership come only when God&#8212;not majority opinion&#8212;sets the king (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Tibni.</span>--Of him we know nothing. No doubt he also was a military chief--possibly Zimri's colleague, under the supreme command of Omri--and the LXX. speaks of a brother, Joram, who fought and fell with him. There is an ominous significance in the terse description of the alternatives of fortune in this internecine struggle, "so Tibni died, and Omri reigned." By comparison of <a href="/1_kings/16-23.htm" title="In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.">1Kings 16:23</a> with <a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.

It is to be considered that the <span class="accented">entire</span> army was not encamped before Gibbethon. Nor are vers. 16, 17 fatal to this view, as Bahr maintains, because "all Israel" there clearly means all the army under the command of Omri. It is hardly likely that Tibni was set up by the people of Tirzah, after the death of Zimri, to continue the struggle. The only thing that is certain is that,the hereditary principle being overthrown, the crown appeared to be the legitimate prize of the strongest; and Tibni, who may have occupied a position of importance, or have had, somehow, a considerable following, resolved that Omri should not wear it without a fierce contest], <span class="cmt_word">to make him king</span> [Omri had been already made king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, anointed, ver. 16];
