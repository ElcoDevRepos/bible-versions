The placement of the cherubim here signifies their role as guardians of divine holiness, reminiscent of the cherubim placed at the entrance of the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). The cherubim in the temple were large, sculpted figures, symbolizing the heavenly beings that surround God's throne (<a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>). This reflects the temple's purpose as a microcosm of the heavenly realm, where God meets with His people.<p><b>Since their wings were spread out,</b><br>The spreading of the cherubim's wings signifies protection and the covering of God's glory. In biblical symbolism, wings often represent swiftness and divine protection (<a href="/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>). The imagery of wings spread out over the Ark of the Covenant, which was placed beneath the cherubim, emphasizes the sacredness of the space and the divine presence that dwells there.<p><b>the wing of the first cherub touched one wall,</b><br>The touching of the wall by the cherub's wing indicates the vastness and grandeur of the cherubim, which were each ten cubits high and ten cubits wide (<a href="/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23-26</a>). This detail underscores the meticulous design and craftsmanship involved in the temple's construction, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. The cherubim's wings touching the walls also symbolize the encompassing presence of God, who fills the entire space.<p><b>while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall,</b><br>This symmetry in the design of the cherubim highlights the order and harmony inherent in God's creation and His dwelling place. The cherubim's wings touching opposite walls create a sense of balance and completeness, mirroring the perfection of God's heavenly throne room. This design also serves as a reminder of God's omnipresence, as His glory fills the temple from wall to wall.<p><b>and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched.</b><br>The touching of the wingtips in the center of the room symbolizes unity and the meeting point of heaven and earth. This central point, directly above the Ark of the Covenant, represents the focal point of God's presence and His covenant with Israel. The cherubim's wingtips touching in the middle signifies the completeness of God's protection and the centrality of His presence in the life of His people. This imagery foreshadows the ultimate meeting of heaven and earth in the person of Jesus Christ, who is the true temple and the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's desire to create a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cherubim.htm">Cherubim</a></b><br>Angelic beings placed in the inner sanctuary of the temple.

God&#8217;s throne, justice, and mercy converge beneath the intertwined wings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a> describes real, monumental cherubim stationed in the temple&#8217;s holiest chamber. Their outstretched wings touched opposite walls and met above the ark, visibly declaring that:<p>&#8226; God dwells among His people in holiness.<p>&#8226; Access to Him is guarded yet graciously provided through atoning blood.<p>&#8226; His presence covers, protects, and commands reverent worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims</span> [The marg. reading, <span class="accented">the cherubim stretched forth their wings</span>, is altogether inadmissible], <span class="cmt_word">so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub</span> <span class="cmt_word">touched the other wan, and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</span> [In <a href="/2_chronicles/3-10.htm">2 Chronicles 3:10</a> we are told that the cherubim were of "image work" (the meaning of the Hebrews word is unknown). We also learn that they "stood on their feet" and, unlike the cherubim of the tabernacle, which faced each other (<a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>), faced the throne, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the cedar partition, and the east. The object of this arrangement probably was to enable the wings to be stretched out across the sanctuary. In the tabernacle the wings were "spread out on high" (<a href="/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/27-9.htm">Exodus 27:9</a>). In both cases the ark and mercy seat were placed under the overshadowing wings (ch. 8:6). There would be a clear space of eight or nine cubits between the bodies of the cherubim, and the ark only measured 2.5 cubits (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>) in length and 1.5 cubits in breadth. Unlike Ezekiel's cherubim (Ezekiel chs. 1, 10; cf. <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>), these had apparently but one face. The cherub was not a simple, but a complex being, having no unalterable and fixed form. See Bahr, Symbolik, 1. pp. 313, 314; Dict.
