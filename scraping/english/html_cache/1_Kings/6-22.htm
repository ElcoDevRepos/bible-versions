Gold, a symbol of purity and divinity, was used extensively in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11</a>) and now in Solomon's temple, indicating continuity in worship practices. The use of gold also reflects the wealth and prosperity of Solomon's reign, as well as the importance of the temple as a central place of worship for Israel. This act of overlaying with gold can be seen as a foreshadowing of the heavenly Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, where the city is made of pure gold.<p><b>until everything was completely finished</b><br>The completion of the temple marks a significant moment in Israel's history, fulfilling the promise made to David that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>). The meticulous attention to detail and the completion of the temple underscore the importance of obedience and dedication in worship. This completion can also be seen as a type of Christ, who declared on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His work of redemption.<p><b>He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary</b><br>The altar in the inner sanctuary, also known as the Holy of Holies, was the most sacred part of the temple, where the presence of God dwelt. Overlaying the altar with gold emphasizes its sanctity and the reverence required in approaching God. This altar is connected to the Day of Atonement rituals (Leviticus 16), where the high priest would make atonement for the sins of the people. In the New Testament, this altar and its rituals are seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He entered the heavenly sanctuary once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was responsible for building the temple.
