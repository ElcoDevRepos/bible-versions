The act of building an altar "in the name of the LORD" signifies dedication and consecration to Yahweh, the God of Israel, distinguishing this altar from those dedicated to Baal. This moment recalls the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who also built altars to the LORD (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:25, 35:7). The use of twelve stones, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, represents the twelve tribes of Israel, emphasizing unity and the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.</b><br>The trench dug around the altar serves a practical purpose in the narrative, as it will later be filled with water to demonstrate the miraculous nature of God's power in consuming the sacrifice despite the water. The measurement of "two seahs of seed" indicates a significant volume, emphasizing the scale of the miracle. A seah is an ancient Hebrew unit of dry measure, roughly equivalent to about 7.3 liters or 1.9 gallons. This detail underscores the thoroughness of Elijah's preparation and the dramatic nature of the impending divine intervention. The trench also serves as a boundary, setting apart the holy space of the altar, reminiscent of the separation between the sacred and the profane in the tabernacle and temple practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in turning the hearts of the Israelites back to the LORD.

By rebuilding an altar with those very stones, he visibly declares that the covenant between God and all Israel still stands, even if many have drifted into Baal worship (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in the name of the LORD&#8221; signals that the altar belongs exclusively to Yahweh. No syncretism, no compromise&#8212;this is the place where the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be honored, and only He will answer (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The act recalls patriarchal worship moments&#8212;Abraham at Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>), Jacob at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>)&#8212;reminding the onlookers that true worship is always rooted in obedience and trust.<p>&#8226; Elijah is also obeying the Law&#8217;s pattern that sacrifice must occur on an altar God designates (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8&#8211;9</a>). By restoring what had been torn down, he underlines the call to national repentance (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>).<p>&#8226; In a public showdown against Baal&#8217;s prophets, the rebuilt altar testifies that the LORD alone is God, setting the stage for fire from heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38&#8211;39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed</b><p>&#8226; A trench around an altar is unusual; Elijah is intentionally adding an unmistakable layer of difficulty. When it later fills with water (v. 35), no skeptic can claim the sacrifice was set ablaze by hidden embers.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Two seahs of seed&#8221; (roughly 3&#8211;4 gallons or 13&#8211;15 liters) tells the reader the trench is substantial. The detail is not incidental; it quantifies the magnitude of water soon to be poured out, emphasizing that the impending fire is supernatural (<a href="/judges/6-38.htm">Judges 6:38&#8211;40</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; The trench ensures that the wood, stones, and even the dust become saturated (v. 35). By soaking everything, Elijah removes any natural explanation, directing all glory to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Symbolically, the trench forms a boundary between holy space and the rest of the mountain. In this moment of national crisis, God&#8217;s altar stands separate, calling Israel to step out of spiritual compromise (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The sheer practicality of digging with no mention of help underscores Elijah&#8217;s resolve. Even before the fire falls, faith expresses itself through diligent action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s careful reconstruction of the altar with twelve covenant stones proclaims that Israel&#8217;s God remains faithful and unrivaled. By adding a deep, water-filled trench, he removes every natural loophole, ensuring the forthcoming miracle unmistakably points to the LORD. Together, these details invite God&#8217;s people&#8212;then and now&#8212;to rebuild true worship on the foundation of His Word and to trust Him to display His power when we stand for His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Measures.</span>--The "measure," the third part of the ephah, hence also often called <span class= "ital">shalish </span>(a "tierce," or "third"), was something less than three gallons.

These words have been variously interpreted. Keil, with Thenius and Wordsworth, understands that "the trench was so large that you could sow two seahs of seed upon the ground which it covered." But apart from the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> must refer to capacity rather than superficial extent, one does not measure a trench, as Bahr observes, by the ground which it covers, but by its depth.
