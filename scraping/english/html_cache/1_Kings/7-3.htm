It was often used in the construction of significant buildings, including temples and palaces. The use of cedar in the roofing of this house signifies the importance and grandeur of the structure. Cedar was imported from Lebanon, indicating the extensive trade networks and the wealth of Solomon's kingdom. This choice of material also reflects the influence of Phoenician craftsmanship, as Hiram, king of Tyre, was a key ally in providing resources and skilled labor for Solomon's building projects.<p><b>above the beams that rested on the pillars</b><br>The architectural design of using beams resting on pillars suggests a sophisticated understanding of construction techniques. This method provided stability and support for the roof, allowing for larger and more open interior spaces. The use of pillars is reminiscent of other ancient Near Eastern architecture, where columns were not only functional but also decorative. The pillars could symbolize strength and permanence, qualities associated with Solomon's reign. This construction method is also seen in the design of the Temple, indicating a consistency in architectural style and a reflection of divine order and beauty.<p><b>forty-five beams, fifteen per row</b><br>The specific mention of forty-five beams, arranged in three rows of fifteen, highlights the meticulous planning and organization involved in the construction. The number fifteen may have symbolic significance, as numbers often do in biblical texts. It could represent completeness or divine order, as seen in other scriptural contexts. The precise arrangement of the beams suggests a well-thought-out design, ensuring the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of the building. This attention to detail reflects Solomon's wisdom and the resources available to him, fulfilling the promise of a prosperous and well-ordered kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the construction of the temple and his palace, demonstrating his wisdom and wealth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_forest_of_lebanon.htm">The House of the Forest of Lebanon</a></b><br>A significant structure in Solomon's palace complex, named for its extensive use of cedar wood, reminiscent of the forests of Lebanon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cedar_wood.htm">Cedar Wood</a></b><br>A valuable and durable material used extensively in ancient construction, symbolizing strength and longevity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillars.htm">Pillars</a></b><br>Architectural elements that provided support and were often ornately decorated, symbolizing stability and grandeur.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_construction_of_solomon's_palace.htm">The Construction of Solomon's Palace</a></b><br>An event that showcases the prosperity and architectural advancements during Solomon's reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_cedar.htm">Symbolism of Cedar</a></b><br>Cedar wood, used extensively in Solomon's constructions, symbolizes strength, durability, and beauty.

The description is so very loose and general that positive statements are out of place, but the meaning certainly appears to be this, that there was a roofing of cedar over the <span class="accented">side chambers</span> (which rested upon the pillars mentioned in ver. 2) <span class="accented">forty-five in</span> number, fifteen in a row. It is true the Masoretic punctuation is against this view. It is also clear that the LXX. understood the numbers forty-five and fifteen to refer to the pillars, for they have essayed to cut the knot by reading <span class="accented">three</span> rows instead of "four rows," in ver. 2. Similarly the Arab. in ver. 3 reads <span class="accented">sixty</span> instead of forty-five; obviously another desperate attempt to solve the difficulty by a corruption of the text. But the solution suggested above is so simple and natural that we can hardly be wrong in adopting it. Bahr says positively that forty-five pillars could not have supported a structure 100 cubits by 50 cubits, "nor could the building have been named ' forest of Lebanon' from forty-five scattered pillars." It would follow hence, that there were side chambers only on three sides of the building, as was the case in the temple. And if (as has been inferred from vers. 4, 5) a three-storied structure is here described; if, that is to say, the forty-five chambers were divided fifteen to a tier or story, it is highly probable that they would be distributed six to each long side and three to the rear (Bahr). This arrangement - a court surrounded by a colonnade and galleries - is still found in the East; as all travellers know. And in its favour it may be said that it is such as to have been suggested by the plan of the temple. The ground plan is the same, with this difference, that a courtyard occupies the place of the temple proper.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[The house] was roofed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1505;&#1464;&#1508;&#1467;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;s&#257;&#183;p&#772;un)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
