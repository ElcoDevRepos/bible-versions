The darkness of night can symbolize the moral darkness of the act being committed. In biblical times, night was a time when people were most vulnerable, as there was no artificial lighting to provide security. This act of deception is reminiscent of other biblical stories where significant events occur at night, such as Jacob's wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-31</a>).<p><b>and took my son from my side while I was asleep.</b><br>The act of taking the child from the mother's side while she was asleep underscores the betrayal and violation of trust. Sleep is often used in the Bible to symbolize a state of unawareness or vulnerability, as seen in the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). The mother&#8217;s vulnerability is exploited, reflecting the broader theme of innocence being taken advantage of by deceitful actions. This also echoes the story of Rachel and Leah, where deception occurs while one party is unaware (<a href="/genesis/29-23.htm">Genesis 29:23-25</a>).<p><b>She laid him in her bosom</b><br>The bosom is a place of intimacy and care, often used in Scripture to denote a close and nurturing relationship, as seen in the imagery of being in Abraham's bosom (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22-23</a>). By placing the living child in her bosom, the woman attempts to claim a relationship and bond that is not rightfully hers. This act of deception is a perversion of the natural maternal bond, highlighting the depth of her deceit.<p><b>and put her dead son at my bosom.</b><br>This final act of switching the children is the culmination of the deceit, symbolizing the exchange of life for death. The dead son represents the consequences of sin and deception, as death is often a result of sin in biblical theology (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The switch also serves as a test of true motherhood, which Solomon later discerns through his wisdom. This narrative foreshadows the ultimate discernment and justice that will be perfectly fulfilled in Christ, who is the true judge and discerner of hearts (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel known for his wisdom, who is approached by two women with a dispute over a living child.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_women.htm">Two Women</a></b><br>Both are described as harlots, living in the same house, each having given birth to a son around the same time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_living_child.htm">The Living Child</a></b><br>The subject of the dispute between the two women, representing the true mother's claim.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead_child.htm">The Dead Child</a></b><br>The child who died during the night, leading to the switch and subsequent dispute.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_court.htm">The Royal Court</a></b><br>The setting where King Solomon hears the case and makes his wise judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's ability to discern the truth in a complex situation highlights the importance of seeking God's wisdom in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>The account underscores the preciousness of life and the deep bond between a mother and her child.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/truth_and_justice.htm">Truth and Justice</a></b><br>The account illustrates the necessity of truthfulness and the pursuit of justice, even when the truth is difficult to discern.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>Solomon's wise judgment reflects God's sovereign hand in guiding leaders to administer justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discernment.htm">The Role of Discernment</a></b><br>Believers are called to develop discernment, seeking God's guidance to navigate complex moral and ethical dilemmas.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_3_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 3:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_20_Deceit_s_consequences.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:20 illustrate the consequences of deceitful actions?

By placing the living child there, the woman attempts to cloak herself in a mother&#8217;s tenderness she no longer possesses.<p>- This counterfeit affection pictures the broader human tendency to mimic righteousness while lacking its reality (<a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>).<p>- It also prepares the stage for Solomon&#8217;s test: true maternal love cannot be faked when the child&#8217;s life is on the line (<a href="/1_kings/3-26.htm">1 Kings 3:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put her dead son at my bosom.</b><p>- The switch is both cruel and symbolic: a lifeless child occupies the place designed for life, mirroring <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>&#8212;exchanging truth for a lie.<p>- The mother awakens to death against her heart, a jarring picture of how sin&#8217;s wages break into peace without warning (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>- In God&#8217;s providence, this dark act becomes the catalyst for displaying the king&#8217;s God-given wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>), proving that the Lord can turn evil schemes into platforms for truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/3-20.htm">1 Kings 3:20</a> portrays deliberate deception carried out under cover of night, exposing the lengths to which sin will go to satisfy selfish desire.
