The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or trial in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). David's forty-year reign can be seen as a time of establishing God's kingdom on earth, setting the stage for the future Messianic kingdom.<p><b>seven years in Hebron&#8212;</b><br>Hebron, located in the southern part of Judah, was an ancient city with deep patriarchal roots, being the burial place of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19, 25</a>:9, 35:27-29). David's initial reign in Hebron reflects his acceptance by the tribe of Judah, his own tribe, before becoming king over all Israel. This period was marked by civil strife, as David's rule was contested by Saul's remaining supporters, particularly Ish-bosheth, Saul's son (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-11</a>).<p><b>and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem, a Jebusite city, was captured by David and established as the political and spiritual capital of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). The choice of Jerusalem was strategic, as it was centrally located and not previously dominated by any single tribe, promoting unity among the tribes. David's reign in Jerusalem is characterized by significant developments, including the bringing of the Ark of the Covenant to the city (<a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-17</a>) and the establishment of the Davidic Covenant, promising an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jerusalem's significance is further highlighted in prophecy and typology, as it becomes the focal point of Messianic expectations and the future reign of Christ (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God, his military conquests, and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>A city in the southern part of Judah where David first reigned as king over the tribe of Judah for seven years.
