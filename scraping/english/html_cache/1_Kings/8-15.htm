Solomon, as king, is addressing the assembly of Israel, highlighting the importance of the occasion. This moment is a culmination of years of planning and labor, and it is significant that Solomon begins by acknowledging God.<p><b>&#8220;Blessed be the LORD,</b><br>The phrase "Blessed be the LORD" is a common expression of praise and worship in the Old Testament. It acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness. This blessing is a form of doxology, a short hymn of praises to God, which is often used in Jewish and Christian liturgies.<p><b>the God of Israel,</b><br>This title emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. It is a reminder of the unique identity of Israel as God's chosen people, set apart from other nations. This covenant is central to the narrative of the Old Testament, beginning with Abraham and continuing through the line of David.<p><b>who has fulfilled with His own hand</b><br>The phrase underscores God's active role in the fulfillment of His promises. It suggests that God is not distant or passive but is directly involved in the affairs of His people. This fulfillment is seen as a divine act, demonstrating God's faithfulness and power.<p><b>what He spoke with His mouth</b><br>This highlights the reliability and authority of God's word. What God speaks, He accomplishes. This is a theme throughout Scripture, where God's promises are seen as certain and trustworthy. It also reflects the prophetic tradition, where God's words are delivered through His prophets and are expected to come to pass.<p><b>to my father David,</b><br>This refers to the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his descendants would rule Israel and that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon, as David's son, is the immediate fulfillment of this promise, but it also points forward to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This introduces the specific promise or prophecy that God made to David. It sets the stage for the recounting of God's words, which are seen as authoritative and binding. The use of "saying" indicates that what follows is a direct quotation or reference to God's promise, emphasizing its importance and divine origin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the king of Israel who built the temple in Jerusalem.

The phrase reminds the gathered crowd&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s dealings with Israel reveal His character to all nations (<a href="/1_kings/8-60.htm">1 Kings 8:60</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has fulfilled with His own hand</b><p>&#8226;

Each phrase celebrates a different facet of that faithfulness&#8212;His praiseworthiness, covenant identity, powerful action, trustworthy word, generational continuity, and verbal precision. The verse invites believers today to bless the LORD with the same confidence, knowing that the God who spoke still works with His own hand to fulfill every promise recorded in Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15-21) His address to the people--apparently preceded by a silent blessing with the usual uplifting of the hands--is the counterpart and expansion of the few abrupt words which he had just uttered before God--calling them to bless God with him for the fulfilment of one part of His promise to David, in the present acceptance of the Temple. The record of that promise is given in <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-5.htm" title="Go and tell my servant David, Thus said the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?">2Samuel 7:5-16</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/17-4.htm" title="Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:">1Chronicles 17:4-14</a>. Here it is freely cited with some variation, so far as it relates to the Temple. It is remarkable that in quoting it, David twice (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1Chronicles 22:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>) adds to it the instructive reason for the prohibition, that (unlike Solomon the Peaceful) he had "shed blood abundantly, and had made great wars." With much grace of filial piety, Solomon refrains from mention of that reason, though there seems to be some allusion to it in his words to Hiram (<a href="/1_kings/5-3.htm" title="You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.">1Kings 5:3</a>). On the other hand, he does add--what is not found in the earlier records--the declaration that, though David was not to build the Temple, "he did well that it was in his heart" to build it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel</span> [<a href="/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>], <span class="cmt_word">which spake with his mouth unto</span> [or, <span class="accented">concerning</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> after verbs of speaking has the force of de (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/40-16.htm">Jeremiah 40:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">David my father</span> [The words were really spoken to Nathan], <span class="cmt_word">and hath with his hand</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, power; cf. <a href="/job/34-20.htm">Job 34:20</a>; <a href="/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a>; <a href="/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>] <span class="cmt_word">fulfilled it</span> [the spoken word He has fulfilled in deed], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, [The reference is to <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, of which Solomon merely gives the substance.
