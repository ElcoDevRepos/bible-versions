In the context of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, a king's servants would include military leaders, counselors, and other high-ranking officials. Ahab's reign is marked by political alliances and conflicts, particularly with neighboring nations like Aram (Syria). The role of servants in a king's court was crucial for decision-making and executing royal commands.<p><b>&#8220;Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours</b><br>Ramoth-gilead was a strategically important city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It was designated as a city of refuge and a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8, 21</a>:38). Historically, it was a contested site due to its location on trade routes and its fertile land. Ahab's claim that it belongs to Israel reflects historical territorial disputes between Israel and Aram. The city had been under Israelite control during the reign of Solomon but was lost in subsequent conflicts.<p><b>but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?&#8221;</b><br>The king of Aram, likely Ben-Hadad II, had control over Ramoth-gilead at this time. The phrase indicates a failure or neglect on Israel's part to reclaim the city, suggesting a lapse in military or political action. This reflects the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Aram, which are documented throughout the books of Kings. The struggle for control over Ramoth-gilead is a recurring theme, culminating in the battle where Ahab is ultimately killed (<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29-37</a>).

Ahab was unable to contend single-handed, and without Divine assistance - which he could not now look for - against Syria; and saw no means of compelling the execution of the treaty which Ben-hadad had made with him (<a href="/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>), and which he appears to have shamelessly broken, except by the help of Jehoshaphat, whose military organizetion at this time must have been great, and, indeed, complete (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10-19</a>). It is in favour of this view that Ahab entertained him and his large retinue with such profuse hospitality.
