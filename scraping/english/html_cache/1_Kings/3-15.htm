Dreams were a common means of divine communication in the ancient Near East, as seen with figures like Joseph (Genesis 37) and Daniel (Daniel 2). Solomon's realization that it was a dream underscores the supernatural nature of the experience, affirming the authenticity of God's promise.<p><b>So he returned to Jerusalem,</b><br>Jerusalem was the political and spiritual center of Israel, housing the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon's return signifies a transition from the high place at Gibeon to the established center of worship. This move highlights the importance of Jerusalem in God's plan, as it would later be the site of the Temple, a type of Christ as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<p><b>stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,</b><br>The Ark represented God's presence and covenant with Israel. By standing before it, Solomon acknowledges God's sovereignty and the centrality of the covenant. The Ark's location in Jerusalem foreshadows the coming of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, embodying God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</b><br>Burnt offerings symbolized atonement and dedication to God, while peace offerings expressed fellowship and gratitude. Solomon's offerings demonstrate his commitment to God and his gratitude for the wisdom granted. These sacrifices prefigure Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which brings atonement and peace between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>Then he held a feast for all his servants.</b><br>Feasting was a common way to celebrate significant events and express communal joy. By holding a feast, Solomon not only celebrates God's blessing but also unites his servants in shared gratitude. This act of communal celebration reflects the future Messianic banquet, where believers will partake in eternal fellowship with Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.
