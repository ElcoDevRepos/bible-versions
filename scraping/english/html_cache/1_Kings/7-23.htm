The term "cast metal" indicates that it was made using a casting process, likely bronze, a common material for temple furnishings due to its durability and beauty. This basin was part of Solomon's Temple, reflecting the grandeur and meticulous craftsmanship of the era. The use of metal signifies strength and permanence, aligning with the temple's purpose as a lasting place of worship.<p><b>It was circular in shape,</b><br>The circular design of the Sea may symbolize completeness and eternity, concepts often associated with God in biblical literature. The shape also allowed for practical use, providing ample space for the priests to perform their purification rituals. Circular structures were common in ancient Near Eastern architecture, often representing the heavens or divine perfection.<p><b>measuring ten cubits from rim to rim,</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Thus, the Sea was approximately 15 feet or 4.5 meters in diameter. This large size underscores the importance of ritual purity in temple worship and the provision for many priests to use it simultaneously. The specific dimensions also reflect the detailed planning and divine inspiration attributed to the temple's construction.<p><b>five cubits in height,</b><br>Standing at about 7.5 feet or 2.25 meters tall, the Sea's height emphasizes its prominence and the significance of purification in the temple rituals. The elevated structure would have been a striking feature in the temple courtyard, visible to all who entered, reminding them of the need for spiritual cleanliness.<p><b>and thirty cubits in circumference.</b><br>The circumference of approximately 45 feet or 13.5 meters suggests a perfect circle, which is mathematically consistent with the diameter given the ancient understanding of pi. This measurement highlights the precision and skill involved in the temple's construction. The Sea's size and capacity (estimated to hold about 11,000 gallons or 41,600 liters) indicate its central role in the daily functions of the temple, serving as a constant reminder of God's provision and the need for holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and its furnishings, including the Sea of cast metal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman from Tyre, who was brought to work on the temple's bronze work, including the Sea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Sea was placed, serving as a center for worship and sacrifice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_cast_metal.htm">The Sea of Cast Metal</a></b><br>A large basin used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing purification and readiness for service.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was located, representing the spiritual heart of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_purity.htm">Symbolism of Purity</a></b><br>The Sea of cast metal symbolizes the need for purification before approaching God.
