His older brothers Amnon and Absalom were dead, and Chileab is not mentioned as a contender for the throne, making Adonijah the eldest surviving son. This context sets the stage for his ambition. The mention of Haggith highlights the multiple wives of David, a common practice for kings of that era, which often led to familial strife and competition among siblings.<p><b>began to exalt himself,</b><br>Adonijah's self-exaltation reflects a common theme in the Bible where individuals seek to elevate themselves without divine sanction. This act of self-promotion contrasts with the biblical principle that God exalts the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). Adonijah's actions can be seen as a parallel to Absalom's earlier rebellion, where he also sought to take the throne by force.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I will be king!&#8221;</b><br>Adonijah's declaration reveals his ambition and presumption. Unlike Solomon, who was chosen by David and anointed by the prophet Nathan, Adonijah's claim lacks divine endorsement. This statement foreshadows the conflict that will arise as he attempts to seize the throne without God's blessing, reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought power without divine approval.<p><b>And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him.</b><br>The acquisition of chariots and horsemen signifies a display of military power and royal authority, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The fifty men running ahead were likely forerunners, a sign of royal procession, intended to impress and gain support from the people. This act of gathering military resources and public display is reminiscent of Absalom's earlier attempt to usurp David's throne (<a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>). It also contrasts with the biblical ideal of kingship, where reliance on God is paramount over military might (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The fourth son of King David, known for his ambition to become king.

The verse stands as a cautionary snapshot: whenever ambition outruns submission to God&#8217;s word, downfall is inevitable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Adonijah</span> (<span class= "ital">my Lord is Jehovah</span>), David's fourth son, born in Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/3-4.htm" title="And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;">2Samuel 3:4</a>), at least thirty-three years before. From the words of Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/2-22.htm" title="And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.">1Kings 2:22</a>, we may gather that he claimed the throne as being now the eldest son. Hence it is probable that Chileab (or Daniel, see <a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2Samuel 3:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:">1Chronicles 3:1</a>), the second son, was dead, as well as Amnon and Absalom. The similarity between Adonijah and Absalom, in respect of personal beauty, favour with a too-indulgent father, ambition and trust in popularity, is evidently suggested by the narrative, which places them in close connection, although born of different mothers. The means, moreover, which Adonijah employed, the body-guard of fifty men, and the maintenance of "chariots and horsemen," are exactly imitated from the example of Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.">2Samuel 15:1</a>); and we note that the festal sacrifice, with the support of two important leaders in peace and war, recalls the same model. But Adonijah hardly shows the craft and ruthless determination of the elder rebel. His attempt on the crown seems crude and ill-planned in conception, and wanting in promptitude of action.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Adonijah</span> [ = "Jehovah is my Lord."

At the same time primogeniture, <span class="accented">ceteris paribus</span>, would have, and as a matter of fact had, considerable weight.
