This was a brutal but effective method to eliminate any potential claimants to the throne. The destruction of Baasha's household reflects the political instability and violence that characterized the Northern Kingdom of Israel during this period. Historically, such actions were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, where dynastic purges were a means of consolidating power.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken against Baasha</b><br>This phrase underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and judgment. The LORD's word, delivered through His prophets, was seen as authoritative and certain. The prophecy against Baasha was a consequence of his sins and idolatry, demonstrating that God holds leaders accountable for their actions. This reflects the biblical principle that God&#8217;s word is unchanging and will come to pass, as seen in other instances of fulfilled prophecy throughout Scripture.<p><b>through Jehu the prophet</b><br>Jehu, the son of Hanani, was a prophet who conveyed God's judgment against Baasha. Prophets in Israel served as God's messengers, often delivering difficult truths to kings and the people. Jehu's role highlights the importance of prophets in guiding and correcting the nation according to God's will. This also connects to the broader biblical narrative where prophets like Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah played crucial roles in calling Israel back to faithfulness. Jehu's prophecy against Baasha is a reminder of the prophetic tradition that holds leaders accountable to divine standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel who conspired against and killed King Elah, Baasha's son, and subsequently became king.
