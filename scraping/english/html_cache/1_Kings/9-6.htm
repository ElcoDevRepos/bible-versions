The context is God's response to Solomon after the dedication of the temple, highlighting the covenantal relationship established with David. The phrase underscores the generational responsibility of the Davidic line to remain faithful. Historically, this warning foreshadows the eventual division and downfall of the kingdom due to idolatry and unfaithfulness, as seen in the later narratives of the kings of Israel and Judah.<p><b>and do not keep the commandments and statutes I have set before you</b><br>The commandments and statutes refer to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God. This phrase emphasizes obedience as a key component of the covenant. The historical context includes the giving of the Law at Sinai and its reiteration in Deuteronomy. Theologically, it points to the necessity of living according to God's revealed will, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The failure to keep these commandments is a recurring issue for Israel, leading to exile and judgment.<p><b>and if you go off to serve and worship other gods</b><br>This phrase addresses the specific sin of idolatry, which was a constant temptation for Israel due to the surrounding polytheistic cultures. The historical context includes the influence of Canaanite religion and the syncretism that often plagued Israel. Theologically, idolatry represents a breach of the first commandment and a rejection of God's sovereignty. This warning is prophetic, as it anticipates the eventual idolatry that leads to the Babylonian exile. In a typological sense, the call to exclusive worship of God points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who perfectly obeyed and worshiped the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel to whom God is speaking.
