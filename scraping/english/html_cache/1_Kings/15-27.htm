The mention of the house of Issachar indicates Baasha's tribal affiliation, which is significant as Issachar was one of the tribes of Israel known for their understanding of the times (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>). This tribal connection may have influenced Baasha's political ambitions and actions.<p><b>conspired against Nadab</b><br>Conspiracy and intrigue were common in the divided kingdom period, reflecting the instability and moral decline of Israel. Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was the king of Israel at the time. The act of conspiracy highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy against Jeroboam's house (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>), showing the divine judgment upon his lineage due to idolatry and sin.<p><b>and Baasha struck him down</b><br>Baasha's assassination of Nadab was a violent act that underscores the turbulent nature of Israel's monarchy. This act of regicide was not uncommon in the ancient Near East, where power struggles often led to the violent overthrow of rulers. It also fulfilled the prophetic word against Jeroboam's house, demonstrating God's sovereignty over the affairs of nations.<p><b>at Gibbethon of the Philistines</b><br>Gibbethon was a city originally allotted to the tribe of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm">Joshua 19:44</a>) but was under Philistine control at this time. The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, and the location of this event in a Philistine city highlights the ongoing conflict and territorial disputes between Israel and its neighbors. The strategic importance of Gibbethon made it a focal point of military campaigns.<p><b>while Nadab and all Israel were besieging the city</b><br>The siege of Gibbethon indicates Israel's military efforts to reclaim territory from the Philistines. The phrase "all Israel" suggests a united military front, yet the internal division and betrayal by Baasha reveal the underlying disunity and political instability. This situation reflects the broader theme of Israel's struggle to maintain faithfulness to God amidst external threats and internal corruption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baasha.htm">Baasha</a></b><br>Son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar.

Baasha, however, used that discernment politically rather than spiritually.<p>&#8226; Tribal identity matters: God works through actual families and lands, fulfilling <a href="/genesis/49-14.htm">Genesis 49:14-15</a> prophecies that Issachar would bear burdens&#8212;here, the burden is leadership.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s plans weave through every tribe, not only Judah.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>conspired against Nadab</b><p>Conspiracy shows calculated intent, not a spontaneous act.

Israel&#8217;s army now loses its king mid-campaign, sowing confusion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a> records more than political intrigue; it is the precise fulfillment of God&#8217;s earlier warning that Jeroboam&#8217;s line would end because of persistent idolatry. Baasha, from Issachar, plots and executes Nadab during a siege at Gibbethon, demonstrating that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s word never falls to the ground.<p>&#8226; Human schemes, even conspiracies, are woven into His larger redemptive plan.<p>&#8226; Spiritual unfaithfulness eventually produces national instability.<p>The verse calls readers to trust God&#8217;s sovereignty, heed His warnings, and pursue faithful leadership lest we repeat Israel&#8217;s tragic cycle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Baasha,</span> sprung from an obscure tribe, hardly at any time distinguished in the history, and himself, as it would seem (<a href="/1_kings/16-2.htm" title="For as much as I exalted you out of the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel; and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;">1Kings 16:2</a>), of low origin in it, is the first of the many military chiefs who by violence or assassination seized upon the throne of Israel. The constant succession of ephemeral dynasties stands in striking contrast with the unchanged royalty of the house of David, resting on the promise of God.<span class= "bld"><p>Gibbethon</span>--a Levitical town in the territory of Dan (<a href="/joshua/19-44.htm" title="And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,">Joshua 19:44</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-23.htm" title="And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:23</a>), probably, like other places in that region, still held by the Philistines till their subjugation by David. The text here implies a revolt of the Philistines against the enfeebled power of Israel, and the occupation of Gibbethon, commanding a pass from the plain of Sharon to the interior. The siege must have been fruitless, at least of any permanent result; for twenty-six years after we find Gibbethon still in the hands of the enemy. (See <a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah.
