His rise to power is significant as it marks the beginning of a new dynasty. Omri's leadership is noted for its military strength and political acumen. The mention of "all the Israelites" indicates a unified force, suggesting that Omri had considerable support among the people, which was crucial for his consolidation of power. This unity contrasts with the division seen earlier in the kingdom, highlighting a temporary stabilization under Omri's rule.<p><b>marched up from Gibbethon</b><br>Gibbethon was a Philistine city located in the territory of Dan, which had been a site of conflict between Israel and the Philistines. The phrase "marched up" suggests a strategic military movement, as Gibbethon was situated at a lower elevation compared to Tirzah. This movement indicates a shift in focus from external threats to internal consolidation of power. The historical context of Gibbethon as a battleground underscores the ongoing conflict between Israel and its neighbors, reflecting the turbulent nature of the period.<p><b>and besieged Tirzah</b><br>Tirzah was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel before Samaria was established by Omri. The siege of Tirzah signifies a critical moment in Omri's campaign to secure his kingship. The act of besieging the city indicates a decisive and aggressive approach to eliminating opposition, specifically against Zimri, who had declared himself king. This event is part of the broader narrative of political instability and the frequent changes in leadership that characterized the northern kingdom. The siege also foreshadows the eventual establishment of Samaria as the new capital, which Omri would build, marking a significant shift in the political and cultural landscape of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>A military commander who became king of Israel.

Whereas Israel had splintered over Rehoboam&#8217;s harshness (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), here the troops and the people rally to Omri, revealing a longing for stability after rapid royal turnovers.<p>&#8211; That collective support underscores the seriousness of the mission: the nation is ready to purge the evil of Zimri&#8217;s brief, violent reign (<a href="/1_kings/16-10.htm">1 Kings 16:10-12</a>).<p>&#8211; It also foreshadows coming division, for a rival, Tibni, will soon claim the throne (<a href="/1_kings/16-21.htm">1 Kings 16:21-22</a>), reminding readers that human unity without wholehearted submission to God is fragile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>marched up from Gibbethon</b><p>&#8211; Gibbethon was a Philistine border town previously besieged under Nadab (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>); Omri had been mid-campaign there.<p>&#8211; The army&#8217;s decision to leave that siege shows decisive leadership: unfinished business can wait when covenant order in the capital is threatened.<p>&#8211; Moving &#8220;up&#8221; reflects the literal ascent from the low coastal plain to the higher hills of Samaria&#8217;s interior (cf. <a href="/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6-7</a>, &#8220;Joshua went up from Gilgal&#8221;).
