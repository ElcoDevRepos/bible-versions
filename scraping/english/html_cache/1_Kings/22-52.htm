The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards, as seen throughout the books of Kings.<p><b>and walked in the ways of his father and mother</b><br>This refers to King Ahaziah of Israel, whose parents were Ahab and Jezebel. Ahab's reign was marked by idolatry and the promotion of Baal worship, heavily influenced by Jezebel, a Phoenician princess. The phrase "walked in the ways" suggests a continuation of their sinful practices, highlighting the generational impact of ungodly leadership. This reflects the biblical principle that children often follow the spiritual paths of their parents, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>.<p><b>and of Jeroboam son of Nebat,</b><br>Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. He is infamous for establishing golden calf worship in Bethel and Dan to prevent Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem. This act is repeatedly condemned in the biblical narrative as leading Israel into sin. The reference to Jeroboam here connects Ahaziah's sins to the foundational idolatry that plagued the northern kingdom.<p><b>who had caused Israel to sin.</b><br>This phrase highlights the responsibility of leaders for the spiritual direction of their people. Jeroboam's actions set a precedent for idolatry that persisted throughout the history of the northern kingdom, leading to its eventual downfall.

Scripture repeatedly evaluates kings by whether they &#8220;did right&#8221; or &#8220;did evil&#8221; before God, reminding us that leadership is accountable to Him (see <a href="/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse immediately positions Ahaziah&#8217;s reign as a continuation of rebellion against the covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And walked in the ways of his father and mother</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Walked&#8221;

<a href="/2_kings/13-11.htm">2 Kings 13:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Ahaziah&#8217;s alignment with Jeroboam shows his sin wasn&#8217;t merely familial; it was national and systemic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who had caused Israel to sin</b><p>&#8226;
