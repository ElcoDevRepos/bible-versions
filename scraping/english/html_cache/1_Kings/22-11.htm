His lineage, being the son of Chenaanah, is mentioned to distinguish him from other individuals with the same name. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a>, Zedekiah is one of the 400 prophets who falsely assure King Ahab of victory. This highlights the presence of false prophets in Israel, contrasting with the true prophet Micaiah. The name Zedekiah means "Yahweh is righteousness," which is ironic given his role in misleading Ahab.<p><b>had made for himself iron horns</b><br>The use of iron horns is symbolic, representing strength and power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, horns were often used as symbols of military might and victory. The act of making these horns suggests a deliberate attempt to visually and dramatically convey a message of assured victory. This act can be seen as a form of prophetic symbolism, similar to how true prophets like Jeremiah used symbolic actions to convey God's messages (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>).<p><b>and declared, &#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>Zedekiah claims to speak on behalf of the LORD, which is a serious assertion. In the biblical context, claiming divine authority without true revelation is a grave offense. This phrase underscores the danger of false prophecy, as it misleads the king and the people. The misuse of God's name for personal or political gain is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>).<p><b>&#8216;With these you shall gore the Arameans</b><br>The imagery of goring suggests a violent and decisive victory over the Arameans, who were frequent adversaries of Israel. The Arameans, or Syrians, were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. This prophecy falsely assures Ahab of success in battle, reflecting the deceptive nature of Zedekiah's message. The use of animalistic imagery is common in prophetic literature, often symbolizing nations or leaders (e.g., <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>).<p><b>until they are finished off.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "finished off" implies total destruction, suggesting a complete and overwhelming victory. This assurance of total victory is misleading, as the true outcome of the battle is contrary to Zedekiah's prophecy. The false assurance given to Ahab contrasts with the true prophecy of Micaiah, who predicts disaster (<a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>). This highlights the theme of divine sovereignty and the futility of opposing God's true word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah_son_of_chenaanah.htm">Zedekiah son of Chenaanah</a></b><br>A false prophet who made iron horns as a symbolic act to support his prophecy.

The episode warns that outward drama and majority approval cannot replace obedience to the Lord&#8217;s authentic word.

But the reference is clearly to the horns of a bullock, and the appropriateness of the prophetic act is only manifest when we remember that Ephraim is compared to a bullock (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), and more, that Moses spake beforehand of the strength of his horns, and predicted that with them he should "<span class="accented">push the people</span> together to the ends of the earth." Not only, that is to say, was the horn a familiar Oriental symbol of power (<a href="/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1, 10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-24.htm">Psalm 89:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8</a>, etc.), but it was identified in a peculiar manner with the powerful tribe of Ephraim; in ether words, with the kingdom of Israel This symbolical act was not necessarily an imitation of the action of Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>). Such acted parables were not uncommon among the prophets (<a href="/2_kings/13-15.htm">2 Kings 13:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a> sqq.; <a href="/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a>; <a href="/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>)]: <span class="cmt_word">and he said, Thus saith the Lord</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>.
