Ahab's actions reflect a lack of spiritual insight or repentance, as he resumes his routine without acknowledging the significance of the divine intervention he witnessed. This behavior contrasts with Elijah's spiritual focus and dedication. The cultural context of ancient Israel often involved feasting as a sign of celebration or relief, yet Ahab's actions here may also indicate a disconnect from the spiritual reality unfolding around him.<p><b>But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel,</b><br>Elijah's ascent to the summit of Mount Carmel signifies his continued commitment to intercession and his role as a prophet. Mount Carmel, a significant geographical location, served as a site for the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal. It is a symbol of spiritual victory and divine revelation. Elijah's climb represents his pursuit of God's presence and his dedication to prayer, contrasting with Ahab's earthly concerns. This act of climbing can also be seen as a type of Christ, who often withdrew to mountains to pray and seek communion with the Father.<p><b>bent down on the ground,</b><br>Elijah's posture of bending down on the ground is a physical expression of humility and earnest prayer. In the biblical context, such a posture is often associated with deep reverence and submission to God. It reflects Elijah's dependence on God for the fulfillment of His promises, particularly the end of the drought. This act of humility is a powerful reminder of the importance of prayer and submission in the life of a believer, echoing the humility of Christ, who often prayed in solitude and submission to the Father's will.<p><b>and put his face between his knees.</b><br>This specific posture of Elijah, with his face between his knees, indicates intense and fervent prayer. It is a position that suggests both physical and spiritual exertion, as Elijah intercedes for rain to end the drought. This imagery of fervent prayer is echoed in the New Testament, where <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17-18</a> references Elijah's effective prayer life as an example for believers. Elijah's posture can also be seen as a type of Christ's own fervent prayers, particularly in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He prayed with great intensity before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, which led Israel into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who challenged the prophets of Baal and demonstrated God's power on Mount Carmel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>A significant location in Israel where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal and prayed for rain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_drought.htm">The Drought</a></b><br>A three-year drought in Israel, a judgment from God due to the nation's idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prayer_for_rain.htm">The Prayer for Rain</a></b><br>Elijah's act of faith and intercession for the end of the drought, demonstrating reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_humble_prayer.htm">The Power of Humble Prayer</a></b><br>Elijah's posture of prayer, with his face between his knees, signifies humility and earnestness.

Yet the contrast with Elijah&#8217;s next steps reminds us that spiritual battles often continue after public victories (<a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Elijah climbed to the summit of Carmel</b><p>- Mount Carmel had just witnessed fire from heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38-40</a>), proving &#8220;The LORD, He is God.&#8221; Returning there shows Elijah&#8217;s confidence that the same God who sent fire will now send rain.<p>- Ascending alone mirrors Moses going up Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>) and Jesus withdrawing to pray on a mountainside (<a href="/mark/6-46.htm">Mark 6:46</a>). Solitude fosters undistracted communion with God.<p>- The elevation lets Elijah watch the western horizon for clouds over the Mediterranean, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise in 18:1.

Elijah agonizes until the promised rain is birthed.<p>- Perseverance marks his prayer; he will send his servant seven times to look for a cloud (<a href="/1_kings/18-43.htm">1 Kings 18:43</a>).

Ahab eats; Elijah intercedes. On Carmel&#8217;s summit the man of God humbles himself, shuts out every distraction, and wrestles in faith until the skies respond. The verse calls believers to pair confidence in Scripture&#8217;s literal promises with persevering, humble prayer that those promises be fulfilled in our day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">Put his face between his knees.</span>--The attitude is, of course, one of prayer, but is a peculiar attitude--distinct from the ordinary postures of standing and kneeling--which has been noted as existing still among the modern dervishes.
