This highlights the contrast between God's power and His gentle communication, emphasizing that God often speaks in quiet, subtle ways rather than through grandiose displays. This moment follows Elijah's flight from Jezebel, showcasing his vulnerability and need for divine guidance.<p><b>he wrapped his face in his cloak</b><br>Elijah's action of covering his face signifies reverence and humility in the presence of God. This is reminiscent of Moses covering his face when speaking with God (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>). It reflects the understanding that no one can see God and live (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>), acknowledging the holiness and majesty of God.<p><b>and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave</b><br>Elijah's movement to the mouth of the cave signifies his readiness to engage with God. The cave is traditionally identified with Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. This location is significant as a place of divine revelation and covenant, linking Elijah's experience to the foundational events of Israel's history.<p><b>Suddenly a voice came to him and said</b><br>The voice of God coming to Elijah underscores the personal nature of God's communication with His prophets. This divine encounter is a turning point for Elijah, providing him with direction and purpose. It highlights the importance of listening for God's voice amidst the noise of life.<p><b>&#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221;</b><br>God's question to Elijah is both a literal inquiry and a deeper spiritual challenge. It prompts Elijah to reflect on his actions and motivations, encouraging self-examination and realignment with God's will. This question is similar to God's inquiries to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> and Cain in <a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>, where God seeks to draw individuals into a deeper understanding of their circumstances and relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a significant role in the spiritual history of Israel, known for his confrontation with the prophets of Baal and his subsequent flight from Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cave.htm">The Cave</a></b><br>A place of refuge and solitude where Elijah sought shelter during his flight from Jezebel, symbolizing a place of encounter with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_voice_of_god.htm">The Voice of God</a></b><br>Represents God's direct communication with Elijah, emphasizing the personal and intimate nature of God's relationship with His prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_horeb.htm">Mount Horeb</a></b><br>Also known as Mount Sinai, a significant location in biblical history where Moses received the Ten Commandments, symbolizing a place of divine revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloak.htm">The Cloak</a></b><br>A garment used by Elijah to cover his face, signifying reverence and humility in the presence of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_solitude.htm">The Importance of Solitude</a></b><br>Elijah's retreat to the cave teaches us the value of seeking solitude to hear God's voice amidst life's chaos.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_gentle_whisper.htm">God's Gentle Whisper</a></b><br>God's communication with Elijah through a gentle whisper reminds us that God often speaks in quiet, subtle ways rather than through dramatic events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_in_god's_presence.htm">Reverence in God's Presence</a></b><br>Elijah's act of covering his face with his cloak demonstrates the appropriate reverence and humility we should have when approaching God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_purpose_and_calling.htm">Divine Purpose and Calling</a></b><br>God's question, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" challenges us to reflect on our purpose and calling in life, encouraging us to align our actions with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/renewal_and_strength.htm">Renewal and Strength</a></b><br>Elijah's encounter with God at the cave serves as a reminder that God provides renewal and strength for those who are weary and discouraged.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_19_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 19:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Elijah_s_humility_in_1_Kings_19_13.htm">How does Elijah's response in 1 Kings 19:13 demonstrate humility before God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Elijah_on_hearing_God_today.htm">What can we learn from Elijah's encounter about listening for God's voice today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Kings_19_13_Exodus_3_1-6.htm">How does 1 Kings 19:13 connect with God's revelations in Exodus 3:1-6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_approach_God_with_reverence.htm">Why is it important to approach God with reverence, as Elijah did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Elijah_s_1_Kings_19_13_impact_on_prayer.htm">How can Elijah's experience in 1 Kings 19:13 guide our personal prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_cover_face_with_cloak_in_1_Kings_19_13.htm">Why did Elijah cover his face with his cloak in 1 Kings 19:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_role_of_the_gentle_whisper.htm">What significance does the "gentle whisper" have in 1 Kings 19:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_19_13_Rethink_God_s_presence.htm">How does 1 Kings 19:13 challenge our understanding of God's presence?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_1_kings_19_fit_with_elijah's_story.htm">How does 1 Kings 19 fit with other biblical accounts of Elijah and the broader historical context, considering potential timeline or narrative discrepancies?

It was the still small voice, apparently, that first brought him to obey the command there given. He would perhaps be afraid to issue from the shelter of his cave during the tempest and the earthquake, which may have followed directly after the instruction to go forth was given. Possibly there was a lesson for him here also, viz., that amid the din and excitement and torture of drought and famine and fire and blood the commands of God are less likely to be heard in the soul and obeyed, than in the hour of peace and stillness. The drought and famine and sword have their work to do, even as the tempest and the earthquake have theirs; but it is by the voice of mercy and love that the hearts of men are turned back again.
