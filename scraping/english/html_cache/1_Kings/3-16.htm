It follows Solomon's request for wisdom from God, which is granted, setting the stage for the demonstration of his divinely-given discernment. The timing is crucial as it showcases the immediate application of Solomon's wisdom.<p><b>two prostitutes</b><br>The mention of prostitutes highlights the inclusivity of Solomon's justice system, where even those marginalized in society had access to the king. In ancient Israel, prostitution was often linked to economic necessity rather than moral failure. This context underscores the impartiality of Solomon's judgment, reflecting God's concern for justice for all, regardless of social status.<p><b>came to the king</b><br>Approaching the king directly was a privilege, indicating the seriousness of their case. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the king was the highest judicial authority. This access suggests Solomon's openness to hear cases personally, a practice that would later be institutionalized in the wisdom literature as a model for righteous leadership.<p><b>and stood before him</b><br>Standing before the king signifies a formal legal proceeding. In biblical times, standing was a posture of respect and readiness to present one's case. This setting emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the expectation of a fair hearing. It also foreshadows the wisdom Solomon would display, which would become renowned throughout Israel and beyond.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the First Temple in Jerusalem.
