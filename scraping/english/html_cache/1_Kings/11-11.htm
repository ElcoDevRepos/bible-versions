Solomon, known for his wisdom, was chosen by God to lead Israel, but his actions led to divine intervention. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders are held to high standards (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>Because you have done this</b><br>The "this" refers to Solomon's idolatry and turning away from God, influenced by his foreign wives (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>). This disobedience is a direct violation of God's commands, showing the consequences of compromising faith for political or personal gain.<p><b>and have not kept My covenant and My statutes</b><br>God's covenant with Solomon was conditional, requiring obedience to His laws (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-9</a>). The covenant included blessings for obedience and consequences for disobedience, reflecting the Deuteronomic principle of blessings and curses (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>which I have commanded you</b><br>This emphasizes the personal responsibility Solomon had to adhere to God's commands. It underscores the importance of obedience to divine instruction, a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><b>I will tear the kingdom away from you</b><br>The imagery of tearing signifies a violent and decisive action. This prophecy foretells the division of Israel, which occurs after Solomon's death when the kingdom splits into Israel and Judah (1 Kings 12). It serves as a warning of the severe consequences of disobedience.<p><b>and give it to your servant</b><br>This refers to Jeroboam, who was a servant of Solomon and would become the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>). This transfer of power illustrates God's sovereignty in raising and deposing leaders (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).
