The number ten often signifies completeness or divine order in biblical numerology. The offering of ten loaves may indicate a complete or sufficient gift, intended to show respect or seek favor. Bread is frequently used in Scripture to represent provision from God, as seen in the manna provided to the Israelites (Exodus 16) and later in the New Testament with Jesus as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>some cakes</b><br>Cakes in biblical times were often made with fine flour and sometimes mixed with oil or honey, indicating a more luxurious or special offering. This suggests an attempt to honor the prophet Ahijah with a gift that goes beyond basic sustenance. Cakes are mentioned in various offerings and celebrations, such as in <a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>, where they are part of grain offerings, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God.<p><b>and a jar of honey</b><br>Honey was a prized commodity in ancient Israel, symbolizing abundance and prosperity. The Promised Land is described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating its richness. Offering honey to Ahijah could signify seeking a favorable prophecy or blessing. Honey also represents the sweetness of God's word (<a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>), suggesting a desire for a positive message.<p><b>and go to him</b><br>This phrase indicates a journey to seek divine insight or intervention. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/14.htm">1 Kings 14</a>, Jeroboam's wife is instructed to visit the prophet Ahijah, highlighting the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. This journey reflects the biblical theme of seeking God's guidance through His appointed messengers, as seen with other prophets like Samuel (1 Samuel 9) and Elijah (1 Kings 17).<p><b>He will tell you what will become of the boy.</b><br>This phrase underscores the prophetic role of Ahijah, who is expected to reveal God's will concerning Jeroboam's son. Prophets in the Old Testament often delivered messages about future events, serving as God's mouthpiece. This reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and foreknowledge. The phrase also highlights the theme of divine judgment and mercy, as the fate of the boy is tied to Jeroboam's actions and God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

In the ancient Near East, bringing food to a prophet was a customary sign of respect and an acknowledgement that the messenger truly spoke for God (<a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Ten loaves show generosity without extravagance&#8212;enough to honor the prophet, yet not so lavish as to appear like a bribe.<p>&#8226; Jeroboam&#8217;s household could afford more; the modest amount underscores how lightly the king regarded the seriousness of his own sin (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Bread, a daily staple (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>), points to basic dependence on God for life, a dependence Jeroboam had forgotten by setting up golden calves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>some cakes</b><p>&#8226; Cakes were special treats, often linked with festive or religious occasions (<a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inclusion signals an attempt to make the visit look like a friendly inquiry rather than a desperate plea.<p>&#8226; Jeroboam&#8217;s wife is instructed to bring &#8220;some,&#8221; not many&#8212;again revealing a half-hearted approach to the LORD while hoping still to gain full blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a jar of honey</b><p>&#8226; Honey symbolizes sweetness and abundance (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s household sends sweetness outward, yet Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry has made the kingdom spiritually bitter (<a href="/1_kings/14-9.htm">1 Kings 14:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet will accept the gift, but the sweetness of honey cannot disguise the sour reality of disobedience (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9&#8211;10</a> contrasts God&#8217;s pure judgments with honey&#8217;s sweetness).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and go to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Go&#8221; indicates humble initiative; Jeroboam himself should have gone, but fear and pride keep him home (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a> reminds that God opposes the proud).<p>&#8226;

The statement assumes divine authority: &#8220;He will tell you,&#8221; not &#8220;He might.&#8221; The outcome for Abijah is already settled by the righteous Judge (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The request centers on the child, yet the prophecy will expose the father&#8217;s sin and pronounce judgment on the entire dynasty (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a> captures a king&#8217;s conflicted heart: outward gestures of honor&#8212;bread, cakes, honey&#8212;mask inner rebellion. The journey to the prophet is right, but the motive is wrong. God sees through every disguise, accepts no partial obedience, and speaks truth unaltered by gifts. The verse reminds us that respectful tokens cannot substitute for repentance, and only wholehearted submission gains the favor we seek for ourselves and those we love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And take.</span>--The presentation of this offering, designedly simple and rustic in character, accords with the custom (<a href="/context/1_samuel/9-7.htm" title="Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?">1Samuel 9:7-8</a>) of approaching the prophet at all times with some present, however trifling.

But we find the same peculiarity, which some would explain by the fatalism of the East, in <a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>, and ch. 8:9, In the present instance, however, no such explanation is needed. For <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jeroboam could hardly ask a favour of a prophet of Jehovah, or hope that it would be granted if he did, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> if, as he feared, the sickness was judicial, it would be useless to ask for healing. The infatuation which insisted on a disguise for the purpose of deceiving the prophet, who nevertheless was believed to be able to divine the issue of the sickness, is very characteristic, and has had many parallels since. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;qa&#183;&#7717;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
