This phrase is reminiscent of descriptions of other biblical figures like Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>), indicating Jeroboam's potential for leadership and military prowess. His valor sets the stage for his future role as a leader of the northern tribes of Israel.<p><b>So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious,</b><br>Solomon, known for his wisdom, recognized Jeroboam's industrious nature. The term "industrious" suggests that Jeroboam was not only hardworking but also efficient and effective in his tasks. This recognition by Solomon highlights Jeroboam's capabilities and foreshadows his rise to prominence. It also reflects the biblical principle that diligence and hard work are often rewarded, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>.<p><b>he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</b><br>The "house of Joseph" refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, descendants of Joseph, who were significant and influential tribes in Israel. By placing Jeroboam in charge of the labor force, Solomon entrusted him with a position of considerable responsibility and authority. This decision indicates Jeroboam's leadership skills and the trust Solomon placed in him. Historically, this labor force was involved in Solomon's extensive building projects, including the construction of the temple and other infrastructure. Jeroboam's role here is pivotal, as it positions him within the socio-political structure of Israel, setting the stage for his eventual rebellion and the division of the kingdom, as prophesied by Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>A young man described as a "mighty man of valor" and industrious.

By observing Jeroboam&#8217;s diligence, he follows the biblical principle that &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The term &#8220;industrious&#8221; points to faithful, persistent work rather than mere ambition, echoing Joseph&#8217;s rise in Egypt because of God-honoring diligence (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s recognition also fulfils <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>, written by Solomon himself: &#8220;Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.&#8221; Jeroboam embodies that exhortation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;House of Joseph&#8221; refers primarily to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>). Jeroboam, an Ephraimite (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>), is placed over his own people, foreshadowing his eventual rule over the northern kingdom.<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s vast building projects required a massive labor levy (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-14</a>). Jeroboam becomes superintendent of that workforce, giving him administrative experience and influence.<p>&#8226; This appointment unintentionally sets the stage for later discontent. The heavy yoke that these laborers bore will become the rallying cry against Solomon&#8217;s son Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-4.htm">2 Chronicles 10:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God is quietly directing events; what appears to be Solomon&#8217;s strategic promotion is ultimately preparing the fulfillment of God&#8217;s word that the kingdom would be torn from Solomon&#8217;s line (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a> records God&#8217;s providential shaping of leadership. Jeroboam&#8217;s God-given valor and diligence earn Solomon&#8217;s trust, securing him a key post over the labor forces of Ephraim and Manasseh. Although Solomon believes he is strengthening his own kingdom, the Lord is actually positioning Jeroboam for the future division of Israel. The verse affirms that faithful work and courage receive recognition, yet it also reminds us that God&#8217;s larger plan is always unfolding&#8212;even through ordinary promotions and daily labor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">A mighty man of valour.</span>--The phrase, like the "mighty valiant man," applied to the young David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-18.htm" title="Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.">1Samuel 16:18</a>), has nothing to do with war, but simply signifies "strong and capable."<p><span class= "bld">The charge</span> (or in margin "the burden"), is, of course, the taskwork assigned to the levy from the tribe of Ephraim (and possibly Manasseh with it). It is clear from this that the levy for the Temple--perhaps originally exceptional--had served as a precedent for future burdens, not on the subject races only, as at first (<a href="/context/1_kings/9-21.htm" title="Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, on those did Solomon levy a tribute of slavery to this day.">1Kings 9:21-22</a>), but on the Israelites also. The LXX. addition makes Jeroboam build for Solomon "<span class= "ital">Sarira</span> in Mount Ephraim" also.<p><span class= "bld">Ahijah the Shilonite.</span>--In the person of Ahijah, prophecy emerges from the abeyance, which seems to overshadow it during the greatness of the monarchy. Even in David's old age, the prophet Nathan himself appears chiefly as a mere counsellor and servant of the king (see 1 Kings 1), and from the day of his coronation of Solomon we hear nothing of any prophetic action. Solomon himself receives the visions of the Lord (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm" title="In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give you.">1Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1Kings 3:2</a>); upon him, as the Wise Man, rests the special inspiration of God; at the consecration of the Temple he alone is prominent, as the representative and the teacher of the people. Now, however, we find in Ahijah the first of the line of prophets, who resumed a paramount influence like that of Samuel or Nathan, protecting the spirituality of the land and the worship of God, and demanding both from king and people submission to the authority of the Lord Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour</span> [same expression <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>.
