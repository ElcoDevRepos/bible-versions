The invocation of "O LORD, God of Israel" emphasizes the unique identity of God as the deity who chose Israel as His people. It reflects the historical context of the Israelites, who were set apart from other nations through the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants. This title for God is frequently used in the Old Testament to remind the Israelites of their special relationship with Him.<p><b>keep for Your servant, my father David,</b><br>Solomon refers to himself as a servant, showing humility and acknowledging his role in God's plan. The mention of "my father David" highlights the Davidic Covenant, where God promised David that his lineage would endure forever. This covenant is a central theme in the history of Israel and is foundational for understanding the messianic expectations that arise later in the biblical narrative.<p><b>what You promised when You said:</b><br>This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God to His promises. It reflects the biblical theme that God is a covenant-keeping God, who fulfills His word. The promises made to David are recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God assures David of an everlasting dynasty. This assurance is a cornerstone of Israel's hope and identity.<p><b>&#8216;You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel,</b><br>This promise is part of the Davidic Covenant, which has both immediate and long-term implications. In the immediate sense, it refers to the succession of David's descendants on the throne of Israel. In the long-term, it points to the coming of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). This promise is seen as a prophecy of the eternal reign of Christ, who fulfills the covenant in a spiritual and everlasting sense.<p><b>if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done.&#8217;</b><br>This conditional clause highlights the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God. The requirement for David's descendants to "guard their way" and "walk before Me" reflects the Deuteronomic theme of covenantal blessings and curses based on Israel's obedience or disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Historically, the failure of David's descendants to remain faithful led to the division of the kingdom and eventual exile. This condition also points to the need for a perfect king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed God and established an eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and the king of Israel who is speaking in this verse.

For (see <a href="/context/2_samuel/7-12.htm" title="And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.">2Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/89-28.htm" title="My mercy will I keep for him for ever more, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.">Psalm 89:28-37</a>) it expressly declares that, even if the seed of David fall away, they shall indeed be chastised, but they shall not be cast off. The prophet Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/31-36.htm" title="If those ordinances depart from before me, said the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.">Jeremiah 31:36</a>; <a href="/context/jeremiah/33-20.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;">Jeremiah 33:20-26</a>) as well as the Psalmist (<a href="/context/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36-37</a>) enforce the declaration by comparing the certainty of its fulfilment with the fixity of "the ordinances of the sun and moon." Like the ordinary dispensations of His Providence, it is in itself fixed and immutable, although the actual enjoyment of its blessing by each individual, or each age, is conditional on right reception of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore now</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And now</span>.
