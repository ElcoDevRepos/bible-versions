The name "Ben-abinadab" means "son of Abinadab," indicating a lineage that may have been significant in Israel. Naphath-dor refers to a region in the territory of Manasseh, near the coastal area of Dor. This area was known for its strategic location and fertile land, which would have been important for supplying the king's provisions. The mention of Naphath-dor highlights the administrative organization and the extent of Solomon's kingdom, which was divided into districts for efficient governance.<p><b>Taphath, a daughter of Solomon, was his wife</b><br>Taphath, being a daughter of Solomon, signifies a political alliance through marriage, which was a common practice in ancient times to secure loyalty and strengthen ties within the kingdom. This marriage would have reinforced Ben-abinadab's loyalty to Solomon, as family ties were crucial in maintaining the stability of the king's rule. The mention of Taphath also reflects Solomon's wisdom in governance, as he strategically placed trusted family members in key positions. This practice of marrying daughters to influential leaders can be seen throughout the Bible, such as in the marriages of King David's daughters. Solomon's extensive family connections through marriage also foreshadow the eventual division of the kingdom due to internal strife and competing loyalties, as seen later in the narrative of the kings of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-abinadab.htm">Ben-abinadab</a></b><br>A regional governor under King Solomon, responsible for the district of Dor.

By placing his name first in this verse, Scripture highlights him as a trusted official&#8212;like &#8220;Azariah son of Nathan&#8221; or &#8220;Ahimaaz&#8221; later in the same list (<a href="/1_kings/4-15.htm">1 Kings 4:15</a>). These men were servants of a king &#8220;greater in wisdom than all the men of the east&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>), so Ben-abinadab&#8217;s role points to Solomon&#8217;s ability to choose capable, faithful leaders (compare <a href="/1_kings/9-23.htm">1 Kings 9:23</a>, which speaks of 550 chief officers who supervised the work).<p>Key ideas:<p>&#8226; Handpicked leadership ensured order and provision, fulfilling the promise of <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a> that Judah and Israel &#8220;ate, drank, and rejoiced.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His very inclusion shows God&#8217;s blessing on Solomon&#8217;s kingdom &#8220;from the River to the land of the Philistines&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Naphath-dor</b><p>The phrase locates Ben-abinadab&#8217;s jurisdiction.

Being &#8220;in Naphath-dor&#8221; means he oversaw:<p>&#8226; A fertile, strategically placed coastal plain.<p>&#8226; Maritime trade routes that could supply grain, fish, and imported goods.<p>&#8226; A region once contested but now peacefully administered, showing Solomon&#8217;s reign had brought stability (compare <a href="/1_chronicles/7-29.htm">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>, where Dor is listed among Manasseh&#8217;s towns).<p>All of this underscores how the kingdom enjoyed the rest promised in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>&#8212;each district free to produce and contribute without fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Taphath, a daughter of Solomon</b><p>Parenthetical information shifts the focus from geography to family.
