The fifteenth day signifies the end of this significant religious event. The number fifteen in biblical numerology often symbolizes rest after deliverance, aligning with the completion of the Temple as a place of rest for the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon's action of sending the people away indicates the end of a sacred assembly, a common practice in Israelite culture after significant religious festivals.<p><b>So they blessed the king</b><br>The people&#8217;s blessing of Solomon reflects their approval and gratitude for his leadership and the successful completion of the Temple. In ancient Israel, blessing a king was a way to express loyalty and appreciation for his role as God's appointed leader. This act also signifies the unity and harmony between the king and his subjects, a theme prevalent in the early part of Solomon's reign.<p><b>and went home, joyful and glad in heart</b><br>The joy and gladness of the people underscore the spiritual and communal success of the Temple dedication. This emotional response is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's presence and blessings lead to communal joy, such as in <a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>. The joy also reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as the Temple becomes a symbol of His dwelling among His people.<p><b>for all the good things that the LORD had done for His servant David</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the continuity of God's covenantal promises from David to Solomon. The "good things" refer to the establishment of David's dynasty and the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his son building the Temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). It highlights God's faithfulness and the realization of His plans through successive generations.<p><b>and for His people Israel.</b><br>The mention of "His people Israel" emphasizes the collective blessing and favor that God has bestowed upon the nation. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the Temple serves as a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel as God's chosen people, tasked with being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who led the dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem.
