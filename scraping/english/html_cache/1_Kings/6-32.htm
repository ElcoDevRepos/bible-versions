Olive trees grow slowly and live long, making their timber dense and lasting&#8212;ideal for the Most Holy Place that housed the ark (<a href="/1_kings/6-19.htm">1 Kings 6:19</a>). Throughout Scripture the olive tree is associated with blessing and God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>; <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>). By placing enduring, fruitful wood at the threshold, Solomon underscored that entry into God&#8217;s presence is grounded in His enduring covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he carved into them cherubim</b><p>Cherubim symbolize God&#8217;s throne guardians, first seen guarding Eden&#8217;s way (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>) and later stretching their wings over the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18-22</a>). Carving them into the doors visually reminded priests that they were about to step into a sphere where God&#8217;s holiness is protected and celebrated (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>). The detail reinforces that the Most Holy Place mirrors the heavenly throne room (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>palm trees</b><p>Palms evoke victory, righteousness, and flourishing in God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-13</a>; <a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). In the tabernacle and later the temple, palms depicted the ideal environment&#8212;an Eden-like sanctuary where life thrives under God&#8217;s rule. Their placement beside the cherubim communicates that true victory and fruitfulness flow from living in obedient fellowship with the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and open flowers</b><p>Open blossoms suggest continual life and beauty, echoing the golden almond blossoms on the lampstand (<a href="/exodus/25-33.htm">Exodus 25:33-34</a>). While the cherubim emphasize holiness and the palms proclaim triumph, the flowers highlight the vibrant, welcoming nature of divine fellowship (Song of Songs 2:12; <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-30</a>). Together they paint a picture of holiness that is not sterile but alive, inviting, and fruitful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold</b><p>Gold speaks of purity, royalty, and incorruptibility (<a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>). Hammered&#8212;literally beaten&#8212;gold accentuates craftsmanship and intentionality, echoing the overlay on the mercy seat (<a href="/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6-9</a>). Covering the carvings in gold proclaims that every aspect of God&#8217;s dwelling, from guardian angels to symbols of life and victory, is bathed in His glorious purity (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). The overlay also prefigures the way Christ clothes believers in His righteousness, granting access into God&#8217;s holy presence (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every detail of <a href="/1_kings/6-32.htm">1 Kings 6:32</a> points to the beauty, holiness, and permanence of God&#8217;s dwelling with His people. Olive-wood doors testify to covenant endurance; cherubim guard the sacred space; palms herald flourishing victory; open flowers display living beauty; and gold overlay crowns it all with glory. Together they remind us that access to God is both awe-inspiring and life-giving, made perfectly available through Jesus Christ, the true and living temple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">The two doors.</span>--Those into the Holy place from the porch, of cypress wood, were naturally made larger. The posts were a fourth of the wall. Hence, according as the wall is taken to be 20 cubits square, or 30 cubits high by 20 wide, the height would be 5 cubits (7&#171; feet), or 7&#171; cubits (11&#172; feet). The width is not given; possibly it is taken to be the same as that of the other doors. As these doors would be much heavier, and more frequently opened and shut, each leaf was made to fold again upon itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The two doors also wore</span> [Rather, perhaps, "And he made" is to be supplied from ver. 31, as Keil.

It is clear from ver. 22 that "all the house" blazed with gold in every part. If the <span class="accented">floors</span> were covered with gold, we may be sure both <span class="accented">walls</span> and <span class="accented">doors</span> would not be without their coating of the precious metal. Our author does not mention the curtain - it is clear that the doors would not dispense with the necessity for a vail - but the chronicler does (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>). It was necessary in order to cover the ark (<a href="/exodus/40-3.htm">Exodus 40:3, 21</a>); hence it was sometimes called "the vail of the covering." But for this, when the doors were opened on the day of atonement, the priest in the holy place might have gazed into the oracle. See on 1 Kings 8:8. The doors opened outwardly (into the house). The vail was suspended within the oracle.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The double</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
