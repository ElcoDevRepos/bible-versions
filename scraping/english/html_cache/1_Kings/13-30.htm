In ancient Israel, burial practices were significant, often reflecting one's honor and status. By laying the man of God in his own tomb, the old prophet showed respect and recognition of the man's divine mission, despite the tragic outcome. This act also signifies a personal connection and acknowledgment of the man of God's prophetic role. Tombs in ancient Israel were often family burial sites, indicating that the old prophet considered the man of God as part of his spiritual family.<p><b>and they lamented over him</b><br>Lamentation was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often involving public mourning rituals. The act of lamenting over the man of God indicates a deep sense of loss and respect. It reflects the recognition of the man of God's role as a true prophet, despite his disobedience that led to his death. This mourning could also symbolize the sorrow over the spiritual state of Israel, which was straying from God's commandments during the reign of Jeroboam.<p><b>&#8220;Oh, my brother!&#8221;</b><br>The expression "Oh, my brother!" signifies a deep emotional bond and respect. In biblical terms, calling someone "brother" often denotes a close relationship, whether familial or spiritual. This phrase highlights the old prophet's acknowledgment of the man of God as a fellow servant of the Lord, despite their initial differences. It also reflects the unity and kinship among those who serve God's purposes, pointing to the broader theme of spiritual brotherhood found throughout Scripture. This lamentation echoes the sorrow and solidarity seen in other biblical accounts of mourning, such as David's lament for Jonathan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_old_prophet.htm">The Old Prophet</a></b><br>An older prophet living in Bethel who deceives the man of God from Judah, leading to his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god_from_judah.htm">The Man of God from Judah</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar King Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where King Jeroboam established a center for idol worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The burial place of the man of God, which belonged to the old prophet, symbolizing respect and mourning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mourning_rituals.htm">Mourning Rituals</a></b><br>The act of mourning, as expressed by the old prophet, reflects a deep sense of loss and brotherhood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The man of God's death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of obedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_human_relationships.htm">The Complexity of Human Relationships</a></b><br>The old prophet's actions show the complexity of human motives and relationships, even among those who serve God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_messengers.htm">Respect for God's Messengers</a></b><br>Despite the man of God's failure, the old prophet's mourning indicates a respect for those who carry God's word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>The account emphasizes the need for discernment in spiritual matters, as deception can lead to dire consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_remembrance.htm">Legacy and Remembrance</a></b><br>The burial and mourning of the man of God highlight the lasting impact of one's actions and the importance of a godly legacy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_30_Honor_God_s_messengers.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:30 emphasize the importance of honoring God's messengers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_1_Kings_13_30_burial.htm">What lessons can we learn from the prophet's burial in 1 Kings 13:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_burial_honor_biblical_dead.htm">How does this burial connect to honoring the dead in biblical tradition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_1_Kings_13_30_s_respect_today.htm">How can we apply the respect shown in 1 Kings 13:30 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_30_Disobedience_consequences.htm">What does 1 Kings 13:30 teach about consequences of disobedience to God's word?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_mourn_the_condemned_man_in_1_Kings_13_30.htm">Why did the prophet mourn the man he condemned in 1 Kings 13:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_30_s_lesson_on_obedience.htm">What does 1 Kings 13:30 teach about obedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_30_Disobedience_consequences_2.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:30 reflect on the consequences of disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/which_biblical_woman_shows_faith,_strength.htm">Who exemplifies faith and strength among biblical women?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_allow_concubines_in_the_bible.htm">Why did God permit concubines in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/2_kings_13_21__can_bones_revive_the_dead.htm">2 Kings 13:21 - How could a dead man be revived simply by touching Elisha's bones, and is there any scientific or historical corroboration for such an event?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_jesus_inherit_david's_throne.htm">Would Jesus inherit David's throne?

His heartfelt lament, &#8220;Oh, my brother!&#8221; reminds us that obedience binds God&#8217;s servants together, while disobedience&#8212;no matter the source&#8212;carries costly consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30-32) <span class= "bld">They mourned.</span>--The mourning of the old prophet, and the burial of the body in his own sepulchre, probably show some touch of remorse and personal compassion for the victim of his treacherous policy, mingled with the desire of preserving the tomb, which was to be his own last resting-place, from desecration, when the prediction of the prophet of Judah should be accomplished. But, even setting aside the rather prosaic tradition of his attempts to remove any impression made on the mind of Jeroboam, which Josephus has preserved (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span>, 9), it is evident that his policy was only too successful. The messenger of wrath had been enticed to familiar intercourse with the prophet of the new idolatry, and had been publicly proclaimed as his "brother:" probably his death had been used to discredit his warning. The result is seen in the significant notice of <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm" title="After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.">1Kings 13:33</a> : "After this thing, Jeroboam returned not from his evil way." Hence the seriousness of the disobedience, which played into the hands of wickedness, and the startling severity of the penalty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he laid his carcase in his own grave</span> [<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>.
