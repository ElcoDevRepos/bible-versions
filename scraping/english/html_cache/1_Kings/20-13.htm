Prophets in Israel served as God's messengers, often delivering divine guidance or warnings. The identity of this particular prophet is not specified, which is not uncommon in the Old Testament. Prophets often approached kings to deliver messages from God, as seen with Nathan and David (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>). This encounter underscores the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and the people, especially the leaders.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase "This is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula indicating that the message is directly from God. It emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the message. This formula is used throughout the Old Testament to introduce divine revelations, as seen in the messages of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8216;Do you see this entire great army?</b><br>The "great army" refers to the forces of Ben-Hadad, king of Aram (Syria), who had besieged Samaria, the capital of Israel. Historically, the Arameans were a significant military power in the region. The mention of the "great army" highlights the formidable challenge facing Ahab and Israel, setting the stage for a demonstration of God's power.<p><b>Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this very day,</b><br>This promise of deliverance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God often intervenes to save Israel from seemingly insurmountable odds. The assurance of victory "this very day" underscores the immediacy and certainty of God's intervention. Similar divine deliverances are seen in the battles led by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>) and Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-9.htm">Judges 7:9</a>).<p><b>and you will know that I am the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The purpose of the deliverance is not only military victory but also spiritual revelation. The phrase "you will know that I am the LORD" is a key theological theme, emphasizing God's desire for His people to recognize His sovereignty and power. This echoes God's declarations in Exodus (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>) and is a call for Ahab and Israel to acknowledge and return to the worship of the true God, contrasting with their prevalent idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his idolatry and being influenced by his wife Jezebel.

Carmel&#8217;s fire (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37-39</a>), God acts so people recognize His exclusive deity.<p>- Even a compromised king like Ahab must confront the reality that the covenant God remains supreme (<a href="/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>).<p>- The verse teaches that every deliverance is a classroom designed to deepen our certainty about who God is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-13.htm">1 Kings 20:13</a> shows God graciously intruding into national crisis, declaring His authority, exposing human helplessness, promising decisive victory, and aiming for heart-level recognition of His lordship. The literal fulfillment of this promise underlines that Scripture means what it says and that God&#8217;s word never fails&#8212;even to leaders who least deserve it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">There came</span> <span class= "bld">a prophet.</span>--The appearance of this unknown prophet evidently shows (see also <a href="/context/1_kings/22-6.htm" title="Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.">1Kings 22:6-7</a>) that Ahab's enmity to the prophetic order was over since the great day at Carmel, and that the schools of the prophets were forming themselves again--perhaps not free from connection with the idolatry of Jeroboam, but safe from all attacks from the worshippers of Baal. It is notable that in all these political functions of prophecy Elijah does not appear, reserving himself for the higher moral and religious mission from God. Ahab receives the prophet's message with perfect confidence and reverence; he has returned in profession to the allegiance to Jehovah, which he had, perhaps, never wholly relinquished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there came a prophet</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">one prophet.</span> Cf. <a href="/1_kings/13-11.htm">1 Kings 13:11</a>.

Where Elijah was at this time, or why he was not employed, we have no means of determining. Bahr says that he was "least of all suited for such a message," but not if he had learned the lesson of <a href="/1_kings/19-12.htm">1 Kings 19:12</a>. At the same time, it is to be remembered that he invariably appears as the minister of wrath. It may also be reasonably asked why this gracious interposition was granted to the kingdom of Samaria at all. Was not this invasion, and would not the sack of the city have been, a just recompense for the gross corruption of the age, for the persecution of the prophets, etc.? But to this it may be replied that Ben-hadad was not then the instrument which God had designed for the correction of Israel (see <a href="/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>), and furthermore that by his brutal tyranny and despotic demands, he had himself merited a chastisement. The city, too, may have been delivered for the sake of the seven thousand (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-34.htm">2 Kings 19:34</a>. Cf. <a href="/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26</a> sqq.) But this gracious help in the time of extremity was primarily designed as a proof of Jehovah's power over the gods of Syria (cf. vers. 13, 28; <a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a> sqq.), and so as an instrument for the conversion of Israel. His supremacy over the idols of Phoenicia had already been established] <span class="cmt_word">unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?</span> [el. ver. 10.
