This act recalls the construction of altars by the patriarchs, such as Jacob, who also used stones to commemorate divine encounters (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>). The number twelve is often associated with God's covenant people, as seen in the twelve apostles in the New Testament.<p><b>one for each tribe of the sons of Jacob</b><br>The reference to the "sons of Jacob" emphasizes the historical and covenantal roots of the nation. Jacob, later named Israel, had twelve sons who became the progenitors of the twelve tribes. This act by Elijah serves as a reminder of the original unity and purpose of the nation, despite the current division into the northern and southern kingdoms. It underscores the call to return to the covenant faithfulness of their ancestors.<p><b>to whom the word of the LORD had come</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine revelation and covenant relationship that God established with Jacob and his descendants. The "word of the LORD" signifies God's promises and commands, which were foundational to Israel's identity and mission. It also points to the prophetic tradition, where God's word is delivered through chosen messengers like Elijah, calling the people back to faithfulness.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Israel shall be your name.&#8221;</b><br>The renaming of Jacob to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>) is a pivotal moment, signifying transformation and divine purpose. "Israel" means "he struggles with God," reflecting both Jacob's personal encounter with God and the nation's ongoing relationship with Him. This name carries the promise of being God's chosen people, set apart for His purposes. Elijah's reference to this name serves as a call to remember their identity and destiny as God's covenant people, urging them to forsake idolatry and return to the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in challenging the worship of Baal in Israel and demonstrating the power of the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/twelve_stones.htm">Twelve Stones</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying unity and the covenant relationship between God and His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_jacob.htm">Sons of Jacob</a></b><br>Refers to the twelve tribes of Israel, descendants of Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal and demonstrated God's power through the miraculous fire from heaven.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_the_lord.htm">The Word of the LORD</a></b><br>Represents God's covenant and promises to the people of Israel, emphasizing their identity and calling as His chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>The twelve stones represent the unity of the twelve tribes, despite their differences.

Instead of improvising with whatever rocks lie around, he chooses exactly twelve stones&#8212;an intentional act that calls the people back to God&#8217;s original pattern for worship. It echoes commands for uncut stones in earlier altars (<a href="/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-5.htm">Deuteronomy 27:5&#8211;6</a>) and Joshua&#8217;s memorial at the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3&#8211;7</a>). In other words, the prophet is saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do this God&#8217;s way, not ours.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One for each tribe of the sons of Jacob</b><p>Israel is politically split: ten northern tribes under Ahab, two southern under Jehoshaphat. Yet Elijah refuses to recognize that division. By laying a stone for every tribe, he preaches unity:<p>&#8226; Reuben<p>&#8226; Simeon<p>&#8226; Levi<p>&#8226; Judah<p>&#8226; Dan<p>&#8226; Naphtali<p>&#8226; Gad<p>&#8226; Asher<p>&#8226; Issachar<p>&#8226; Zebulun<p>&#8226; Joseph (represented by Ephraim and Manasseh)<p>&#8226; Benjamin<p>The prophet silently reminds them that God still sees one covenant family (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22&#8211;26</a>), even after centuries of infighting (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16&#8211;24</a>). The altar itself becomes a living sermon: &#8220;You belong together under the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To whom the word of the LORD had come and said</b><p>The phrase reaches all the way back to the patriarch&#8217;s encounters with God. Jacob heard the LORD speak promises at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13&#8211;15</a>) and again at Paddan-aram (<a href="/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9&#8211;12</a>). Elijah is anchoring today&#8217;s confrontation with Baal in yesterday&#8217;s revelation: what God spoke then still governs now (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>). By invoking &#8220;the word of the LORD,&#8221; the prophet reminds the crowd that covenant words, not shifting culture, define reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel shall be your name</b><p>When Jacob wrestled with God, the LORD declared, &#8220;&#8216;Your name shall no longer be Jacob,&#8217; He said, &#8216;but Israel, because you have struggled with God and men and have prevailed&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). &#8220;Israel&#8221; means &#8220;God strives&#8221; or &#8220;one who strives with God.&#8221; The name change marked a new identity&#8212;no longer deceiver (Jacob) but prince with God (Israel). Elijah&#8217;s twelve-stone altar pulls that identity forward, urging the nation to live up to its God-given name rather than the idolatrous path it has chosen (<a href="/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a>; <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6</a>). By rebuilding in the name of &#8220;Israel,&#8221; Elijah declares, &#8220;Return to who you really are&#8212;people marked by God&#8217;s promise and presence.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase in <a href="/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a> drips with purpose: twelve deliberately chosen stones recall the undivided covenant family; they restate God&#8217;s original word to Jacob, now Israel; and they summon a wayward nation back to its true identity under the LORD. Elijah&#8217;s simple construction project becomes a theological billboard: God&#8217;s covenant stands, His word endures, and His people are called to unity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Twelve stones.</span>--The emphatic notice of these, as emblematic of the twelve tribes, is significant.

The act was thus a protest against the schism. We cannot hold with Keil, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al</span>. that it was "a practical declaration on the part of the prophet that the division of the nation <span class="accented">into two kingdoms</span> was at variance with the will of God," because we are distinctly told that that division was "from the Lord" (<a href="/1_kings/12-15.htm">1 Kings 12:15</a>).
