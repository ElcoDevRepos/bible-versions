Ahab, known for his idolatry and marriage to Jezebel, reigned over Israel from approximately 874 to 853 BC. His reign was marked by significant conflict with the prophets of Yahweh, notably Elijah. The fourth year of Ahab's reign would be around 870 BC, a time when Israel was experiencing both political strength and spiritual decline.<p><b>Jehoshaphat son of Asa</b><br>Jehoshaphat was the son of Asa, who was a king noted for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry. Asa's reign was characterized by a return to the worship of Yahweh, and Jehoshaphat continued this legacy. Jehoshaphat's name means "Yahweh has judged," reflecting his commitment to the God of Israel. His lineage is significant as it connects to the Davidic line, which is central to the messianic prophecies concerning Jesus Christ.<p><b>became king of Judah</b><br>Jehoshaphat's ascension to the throne of Judah marks a continuation of the Davidic dynasty, which is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding an everlasting kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). His reign, which lasted from approximately 873 to 849 BC, was noted for military strength, economic prosperity, and religious reforms. Jehoshaphat sought to strengthen Judah's position through alliances, including a notable, albeit controversial, alliance with Ahab of Israel. His reign is often seen as a period of relative peace and stability in Judah, contrasting with the turmoil in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The son of Asa, Jehoshaphat became the king of Judah.

This is a literal chronological marker, anchoring events firmly in real time.<p>- The Bible often provides such timing to show God&#8217;s orderly unfolding of history (cf. <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, &#8220;when the fullness of time had come&#8221;).<p>- Counting from Ahab&#8217;s start in <a href="/1_kings/16-29.htm">1 Kings 16:29</a>, the fourth year falls roughly around 870 BC, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant people generation after generation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Ahab&#8217;s reign over Israel</b><p>- Ahab ruled the northern kingdom and is introduced as doing &#8220;more evil in the sight of the LORD than all who were before him&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30</a>).<p>- His reign was marked by idolatry, especially through his alliance with Jezebel and the worship of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>).<p>- Mentioning Ahab here sets a stark contrast: while Israel endures a corrupt monarch, Judah receives a king committed to the LORD (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat son of Asa</b><p>- Jehoshaphat&#8217;s spiritual heritage comes from his father Asa, who &#8220;did what was right in the eyes of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>).<p>- Asa removed idols (<a href="/1_kings/15-12.htm">1 Kings 15:12-13</a>) and sought the LORD in times of crisis (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>), providing a godly model for his son.<p>- That lineage highlights the generational impact of faithfulness: Jehoshaphat&#8217;s reforms and trust in God (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>; 20:3-4) flow naturally from Asa&#8217;s example.<p>- God&#8217;s covenant with David promised a continuing line on Judah&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>); Jehoshaphat&#8217;s mention by name affirms that unbroken line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>became king of Judah</b><p>- The verse records the literal transfer of authority: Jehoshaphat &#8220;became king of Judah.&#8221; Some scholars note a co-regency beginning earlier (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-1.htm">2 Chronicles 17:1</a>), but 1 Kings focuses on his sole reign&#8217;s public recognition.<p>- His rule brings spiritual renewal&#8212;he removed high places, sent teachers of the Law throughout Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>), and led nationwide prayer when threatened (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-4.htm">2 Chronicles 20:4</a>).<p>- By contrasting Judah&#8217;s godly leadership with Israel&#8217;s apostasy, Scripture underscores the blessings tied to obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).<p>- Jehoshaphat&#8217;s reign also illustrates that even faithful leaders must guard against compromise; his later alliance with Ahab leads to divine rebuke (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/22-41.htm">1 Kings 22:41</a> is more than a date stamp.

In the Chronicles, on the contrary, there is a full and interesting account of the reign of Jehoshaphat, and especially of his great religious revival (2 Chronicles 17-20), coinciding with this chapter, almost verbally, in the account of the battle at Ramoth-gilead. The brief notices here of the religious work of Jehoshaphat, his <span class= "ital">"</span>might," and his "wars," agree entirely with this fuller record.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoahaphat</span> ["Whom Jehovah judges"] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</span> [The historian now resumes for a moment the history of Judah, which has dropped out of notice since <a href="/1_kings/15-24.htm">1 Kings 15:24</a>, where the accession of Jehoshaphat was mentioned.
