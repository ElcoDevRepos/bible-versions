The tribe of Naphtali was located in the northern part of Israel, a region known for its fertile land and strategic location. This area was significant in biblical history, as it was part of the land allotted to the tribe of Naphtali by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/19-32.htm">Joshua 19:32-39</a>). The appointment of Ahimaaz in this region underscores the importance of maintaining strong governance and resource management in the northern territories. The role of district governors was crucial for the administration of Solomon's kingdom, reflecting the centralized government system that Solomon established, which was a departure from the tribal confederation of the Judges period.<p><b>(he had married Basemath, a daughter of Solomon);</b><br>The marriage of Ahimaaz to Basemath, Solomon's daughter, indicates a political alliance and the consolidation of power within the kingdom. Marriages in ancient Israel often served to strengthen political ties and ensure loyalty among the ruling class. This practice was common in the ancient Near East, where royal families intermarried to secure alliances and peace. The mention of Basemath highlights the interconnectedness of Solomon's administration, where family ties were used to reinforce the stability and unity of the kingdom. This also reflects the wisdom of Solomon in using familial relationships to maintain control over his vast empire. The inclusion of Solomon's daughter in this context may also symbolize the extension of Solomon's influence and the perpetuation of his legacy through his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimaaz.htm">Ahimaaz</a></b><br>A prominent official in King Solomon's administration, Ahimaaz was appointed as a regional governor over the territory of Naphtali.

If this is the same Ahimaaz who served David (<a href="/2_samuel/18-19.htm">2 Samuel 18:19&#8211;29</a>), we have a seasoned, trustworthy leader who once ran with good news of victory. Whether the very same man or a namesake of that loyal family, the mention signals integrity. Earlier in the chapter Solomon surrounds himself with godly servants such as Zadok and Benaiah (<a href="/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>), so adding Ahimaaz continues the pattern of appointing men whose past obedience proves they can be trusted with present responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Naphtali</b><p>Solomon had divided the land into twelve administrative districts (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7&#8211;19</a>). By stating that Ahimaaz is &#8220;in Naphtali,&#8221; Scripture places him over the northern territory bordering the Sea of Galilee (<a href="/joshua/19-32.htm">Joshua 19:32&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8226; This region had been blessed with fruitfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>) and later became the first to see Messiah&#8217;s light (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Stationing a dependable governor there protected trade routes and secured the kingdom&#8217;s perimeter.<p>&#8226; It demonstrates Solomon&#8217;s wisdom in spreading qualified leadership across the land rather than hoarding power in Jerusalem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he had married Basemath</b><p>Next, we are told that Ahimaaz &#8220;had married Basemath.&#8221; In Israel, marriage often sealed alliances (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17&#8211;27</a>). Within Solomon&#8217;s administration, such a union accomplished two things:<p>&#8226; It rewarded proven service with royal favor (<a href="/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>).<p>&#8226; It bound the official&#8217;s welfare to the king&#8217;s house, encouraging loyalty (cf. <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a> where Solomon himself used marriage to secure peace with Egypt).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a daughter of Solomon</b><p>Identifying Basemath as Solomon&#8217;s daughter underlines the value the king placed on this appointment. Unlike the later foreign wives Solomon takes (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1&#8211;4</a>), this domestic alliance strengthened, rather than weakened, covenant obedience:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/45-16.htm">Psalm 45:16</a> pictures royal offspring placed &#8220;as princes in all the earth,&#8221; and here one of those daughters becomes a link between throne and province.<p>&#8226; The arrangement echoes David&#8217;s practice of promoting men who shared both his faith and his family (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15&#8211;18</a>), weaving unity throughout the kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/4-15.htm">1 Kings 4:15</a> is more than a staffing note; it shows Solomon anchoring his realm in godly, time-tested leadership. A faithful servant (Ahimaaz) receives strategic oversight (in Naphtali) and is bound to the throne through marriage (Basemath, a daughter of Solomon). The verse testifies that wise administration, covenant loyalty, and family ties can work together to secure blessing for God&#8217;s people when the leaders involved honor the Lord and His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) The eighth division is the upper valley of the Jordan, south of Mount Hermon, including part of the north-west coast of the sea of Gennesareth and the water of Merom.
