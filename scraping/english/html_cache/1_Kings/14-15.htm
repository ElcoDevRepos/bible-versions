The imagery of a reed shaken in the water suggests vulnerability and lack of foundation, reflecting Israel's spiritual and moral state. In biblical symbolism, reeds often represent fragility (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>). The LORD's action here is a response to Israel's disobedience, particularly under King Jeroboam's reign, who led the nation into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p><b>He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers,</b><br>The "good land" refers to the Promised Land, a gift from God to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). Uprooting signifies exile and loss of divine favor, a reversal of the covenant blessings due to Israel's unfaithfulness. This foreshadows the Assyrian exile of the Northern Kingdom in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), fulfilling the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-68</a>.<p><b>and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates,</b><br>The Euphrates River marks the boundary of the land promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Scattering beyond it implies dispersion into foreign lands, a common consequence of covenant violation (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). Historically, this refers to the Assyrian conquest, where Israelites were deported to regions beyond the Euphrates, such as Assyria and Media.<p><b>because they have made their Asherah poles,</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, representing fertility and idolatry. Their presence in Israel indicates syncretism and violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The poles were often set up beside altars to Baal, showing the extent of Israel's apostasy (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>).<p><b>provoking the LORD to anger.</b><br>Provoking God to anger highlights the seriousness of Israel's idolatry and covenant breach. The LORD's anger is a response to persistent disobedience and rejection of His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7-8</a>). This divine wrath is not arbitrary but a just response to Israel's actions, emphasizing the holiness and righteousness of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is pronouncing judgment on the nation for their idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which is being warned of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/reed_swaying_in_the_water.htm">Reed Swaying in the Water</a></b><br>A metaphor for instability and vulnerability, symbolizing Israel's weakened state due to their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_land.htm">The Good Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which God gave to the ancestors of Israel as an inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Idolatrous symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, which provoked God's anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to instability and judgment.

Of all such utterances we must remember the express declaration of <a href="/context/jeremiah/18-7.htm" title="At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a> : "At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation . . . to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy; if that nation . . . turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them." The prophecy uttered does not foreclose the probation of future ages. This is, after all, only one illustration of the great truth that--however impossible it is for us to comprehend the mystery--the foreknowledge of God does not preclude the freedom and responsibility of man.<p>The metaphor is of the reed shaken to and fro in the river, till at last it is rooted up, swept down the stream, and cast up on some distant shore.<p><span class= "bld">Their groves.</span>--The word rendered "grove" is properly <span class= "ital">Asherah</span>, an idol: apparently the straight stem of a tree, surmounted by an emblem of the goddess represented (whence, perhaps, the wrong translation which, from the LXX. and Vulgate, has made its way into our version). (See <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm" title="You shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href="/judges/6-25.htm" title="And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take your father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the grove that is by it:">Judges 6:25</a>; <a href="/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>, &c.) It is thought to have been an image of some deity like Astarte; and Gesenius infers from the derivation of the name that it was dedicated to her, as the goddess of good fortune. But the worship dates from a far earlier time than the introduction of the worship of the Tyrian Astarte, and the word itself is etymologically distinct from <span class= "ital">Ashtoreth </span>or<span class= "ital"> Ashtaroth</span>. It is notable that in <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm" title="Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.">2Kings 23:15</a> Josiah is said not only to have destroyed the altar and high places at Bethel, but to have "burned the Asherah;" whence it may probably be concluded that (as is perhaps implied in this passage) the old worship of the Asherah, with all its superstitious and profligate accompaniments, grew up under the very shadow of the newer idolatry. From the worship of images as emblems to superstitious veneration of the images themselves, and thence to worship of many gods, the transition is unhappily only too easy. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">And</span>.
