His reign marked a period of consolidation of power and establishment of his authority. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was a loyal and valiant warrior, known for his bravery and leadership. He was one of David's mighty men and served as the commander of Solomon's army. This order reflects Solomon's decisive leadership and the importance of loyalty in his administration. Benaiah's role as an executor of justice highlights the transition from David's reign to Solomon's, emphasizing the need to eliminate threats to the throne.<p><b>and he struck down Adonijah</b><br>Adonijah was Solomon's older brother who had previously attempted to claim the throne before David's death. His actions were seen as a direct challenge to God's chosen king, Solomon. The striking down of Adonijah was a fulfillment of Solomon's need to secure his kingship and prevent any further rebellion. This act of execution was not merely political but also a divine mandate to uphold the God-ordained leadership. The removal of Adonijah can be seen as a parallel to the purging of sin and rebellion, a theme consistent throughout the Bible.<p><b>and he died</b><br>The death of Adonijah signifies the end of a potential threat to Solomon's rule and the establishment of peace and order in the kingdom. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God's anointed. This event echoes the biblical principle that disobedience and defiance against divine authority lead to judgment and death. In a broader theological context, it foreshadows the ultimate judgment against sin and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom through Jesus Christ, who is the greater Solomon, bringing true peace and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_solomon.htm">King Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

[Solomon has been accused of "a coldblooded vengeance" and of "that jealous cruelty so common in Oriental despots," in ordering the execution of his brother. But unjustly. It is to be remembered that on the occasion of Adonijah's first rebellion the young monarch had displayed the greatest magnanimity towards him. He might then have justly decreed against him the death which no doubt the conspirators had designed against him (<a href="/1_kings/1-12.htm">1 Kings 1:12</a>.) Adonijah, by fleeing to the altar, showed that he had good grounds for fearing the avenging sword. He was clearly conscious that he had merited the death of the traitor. But Solomon spared him, during good behaviour. He warned him that "if wickedness were found in him" he should die (<a href="/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>.) His first treason, consequently, was not to be lost sight of, in case he were guilty of a fresh offence. And now that he is found conspiring again; now that he abuses the royal clemency, and seeks by chicanery and intrigue to snatch his brother's crown, the sentence of death takes effect. This renewed attempt, after failure and forgiveness, must have convinced the king that Adonijah's pretensions would be a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of his empire, and therefore he owed it to himself, to his subjects, and above all to God, who had entrusted him with the crown, to put this restless and dangerous plotter out of the way. To pass over a second offence would be a virtual encouragement of sedition, for it would show that the king was weak and might be trifled with. Adonijah therefore must die, not only in expiation of his treason, but as an example to the subjects of Solomon, that the disaffected, including all Adonijah's partizans, might be awed into obedience. <p> CHAPTER 2:26-35.
