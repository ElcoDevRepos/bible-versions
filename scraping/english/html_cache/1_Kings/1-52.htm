This moment occurs during a critical transition of power in Israel. Solomon's response reflects his wisdom and discernment, qualities for which he is renowned. His reply is significant as it sets the tone for his reign, emphasizing justice and righteousness.<p><b>If he is a man of character</b><br>The phrase "man of character" implies integrity and righteousness. In the biblical context, character is often associated with one's relationship with God and adherence to His commandments. Solomon's condition reflects the biblical principle that God honors those who walk in integrity (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>). This also echoes the covenantal blessings and curses outlined in Deuteronomy, where obedience leads to life and blessing.<p><b>not a single hair of his will fall to the ground</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom meaning complete safety and protection. It signifies that no harm will come to Adonijah if he proves to be righteous. This assurance of safety is reminiscent of God's protection over His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>, where Jonathan is spared because of his righteousness.<p><b>But if evil is found in him</b><br>"Evil" in this context refers to rebellion or actions contrary to God's will. The biblical narrative often contrasts good and evil, with evil leading to judgment. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of accountability, where individuals are judged based on their actions (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). It also reflects the wisdom literature's emphasis on discerning the heart's intentions (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).<p><b>he will die</b><br>The consequence of death for evil actions is consistent with the Mosaic Law, where certain transgressions warranted capital punishment (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). This reflects the seriousness with which God views sin and rebellion. In a broader theological context, it points to the ultimate consequence of sin, which is spiritual death, as outlined in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. Solomon's declaration foreshadows the ultimate judgment that Christ will execute as the righteous King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.
