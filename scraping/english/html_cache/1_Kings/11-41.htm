Solomon, the son of David, was the third king of Israel and is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem. His reign marked a period of peace and prosperity for Israel, but it also included political alliances through marriages and the eventual introduction of idolatry, which led to his downfall.<p><b>all that he did</b><br>Solomon's actions included significant political, economic, and religious undertakings. He expanded Israel's borders, established trade routes, and accumulated wealth. His administrative skills were evident in the organization of the kingdom into districts and the establishment of a standing army. However, his later years were marked by turning away from God, influenced by his foreign wives, which led to the worship of other gods and ultimately the division of the kingdom after his death.<p><b>as well as his wisdom</b><br>Solomon's wisdom is legendary, granted to him by God in response to his request for an understanding heart to govern the people. This wisdom is exemplified in his judicial decisions, such as the famous case of the two women claiming to be the mother of a child. Solomon's wisdom also extended to his writings, including Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon, which are part of the biblical canon and continue to be studied for their insights into human nature and divine truth.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests the existence of an external source that recorded Solomon's deeds, which is not part of the biblical canon. The "Book of the Acts of Solomon" is considered a lost work, possibly a royal annal or historical record kept during his reign. This mention highlights the practice of documenting royal histories in the ancient Near East, similar to the annals of other kings in the region. The absence of this book in the biblical text underscores the selective nature of the biblical narrative, focusing on theological and moral lessons rather than exhaustive historical accounts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

Scripture regularly acknowledges its own selectivity: compare <a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>, which point to other sources for fuller royal records, and <a href="/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>, where the apostle notes that Jesus&#8217; deeds could fill countless books.<p>&#8226; By introducing &#8220;the rest,&#8221; the writer invites readers to remember the sweeping reign God granted Solomon after David&#8217;s charge (<a href="/1_kings/2-1.htm">1 Kings 2:1-4</a>) and the fulfillment of earlier promises (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>). The reliability of those promises is underlined by the straightforward historical tone&#8212;Scripture faithfully reports what actually happened.<p>&#8226; The phrase also sets up a contrast: despite Solomon&#8217;s early faithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/3-3.htm">1 Kings 3:3-9</a>) and magnificent building projects (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6&#8211;7</a>), the chapter has just described his tragic drift into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>). Mentioning &#8220;the rest&#8221; reminds us that a believer&#8217;s legacy is a sum of both victories and failures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all that he did, as well as his wisdom</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All that he did&#8221; encompasses statecraft, construction, commerce, and diplomacy. <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26-28</a> highlights his navy; <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a> lists his chariots and horsemen; <a href="/bsb/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a> summarizes his administrative reach.

That wisdom produced 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs (<a href="/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>) and drew the Queen of Sheba to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1-9</a>). <a href="/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a> name Solomon as their human author, further illustrating how God worked through him.<p>&#8226; The pairing of deeds with wisdom shows that godly insight should shape practical action (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>). Solomon&#8217;s life demonstrates both the heights attainable when wisdom is heeded and the depths reached when it is ignored (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a> offers the same principle).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?</b><p>&#8226; Ancient Israel kept annals that recorded royal affairs; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:29</a> refers to &#8220;the records of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer.&#8221; Citing such a source underscores the historicity of Solomon&#8217;s reign; the biblical author anchors his narrative in verifiable documents.<p>&#8226; The Spirit-led writer does not require those external books for authority&#8212;<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a> affirms that the Scriptures themselves are God-breathed&#8212;but he points to them to show that the biblical account aligns with other credible testimony, much like <a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a> references preliminary narratives.<p>&#8226; The original records have not survived, yet their mention reassures readers that God&#8217;s Word is rooted in real time and space.

By pointing to additional records, the verse stresses the factual nature of biblical history while highlighting that Scripture selectively presents what is essential for God&#8217;s purposes. The verse also reminds us that obedience and wisdom should shape every deed, and that even the most gifted believer&#8217;s life is fully known to God and accountable to His record.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">The book of the acts of Solomon.</span>--In <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?">2Chronicles 9:29</a> the acts of Solomon are said to be "written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat." The prophets appear here in the character of annalists. The book of Nathan presumably contained only the history of the early years; that of Ahijah may have well covered most of the later reign; and the visions of Iddo "could but have dealt incidentally with the closing acts of Solomon. The narrative as given in the Book of Kings is evidently a compilation drawn from various sources, differing in various parts, both in style and in degree of detail. Thus the account of the Temple building and dedication evidently comes from some temple record; and the references to Solomon's territory, and the arrangements of his kingdom, look like notes drawn from official archives.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> [The sources of this history are mentioned more specifically in <a href="/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/11-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1448;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
