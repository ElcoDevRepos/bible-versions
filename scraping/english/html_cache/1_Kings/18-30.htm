This invitation is reminiscent of the call to repentance and turning back to God. Elijah, as a prophet, acts as a mediator between God and the people, similar to how Christ calls believers to Himself (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). The gathering of the people also sets the stage for a public demonstration of God's power, emphasizing the communal aspect of faith and worship in Israelite culture.<p><b>So all the people approached him,</b><br>The people's response to Elijah's call indicates their willingness to witness the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal. This moment reflects a critical point in Israel's history, where the nation is torn between the worship of Yahweh and the allure of Baal worship, which was prevalent due to the influence of Queen Jezebel. The people's approach signifies a moment of decision, echoing Joshua's challenge to the Israelites to choose whom they will serve (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><b>and he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.</b><br>The altar's repair symbolizes the restoration of true worship and the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The altar, likely located on Mount Carmel, had been neglected and destroyed, representing the spiritual decay in Israel. Elijah's actions foreshadow Christ's role in restoring the broken relationship between God and humanity through His sacrifice. The act of repairing the altar also connects to the broader biblical theme of renewal and repentance, as seen in Nehemiah's rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17-18</a>). The altar's restoration is a physical manifestation of the call to return to the worship of the one true God, rejecting idolatry and reaffirming the covenant established with the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a crucial role in turning the hearts of the Israelites back to Yahweh.

Rebuilding it declares that the covenant is not obsolete, only neglected.<p>&#8226; Twelve stones (see vv. 31&#8211;32) affirm the unity of all tribes under Yahweh, opposing Baal&#8217;s divisive influence.<p>&#8226; For believers today, repairing the altar points to renewing wholehearted devotion&#8212;offering ourselves as &#8220;a living sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s four brief actions draw the nation from wavering to witness: he calls the people, invites close inspection, receives their approach, and restores true worship.

But it is just as likely that it had been restored, if not raised, by some of the "seven thousand who had not bowed their knees unto Baal," or by some of the faithful remaining in Israel after the calf-worship and the hostility between the two kingdoms had made worship at Jerusalem an impossibility. Anyhow we can hardly be mistaken in holding that this was one of the "altars" (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>), thrown down" by command of Ahab or Jezebel. Elijah's repairing it was an act of profound significance. It showed him as the restorer of the law and the true religion.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elijah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_452.htm">Strong's 452: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elijah -- 'Yah is God', a well-known prophet of Israel, also three other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
