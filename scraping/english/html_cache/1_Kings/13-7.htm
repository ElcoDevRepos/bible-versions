Jeroboam's reign is marked by idolatry, as he set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from worshiping in Jerusalem. The "man of God" is a prophet sent by God to deliver a message of judgment against Jeroboam's altar at Bethel. This encounter highlights the tension between the king's authority and the divine authority represented by the prophet. The term "man of God" is often used in the Old Testament to denote a prophet or someone with a special calling from God, emphasizing the divine mission and authority of the individual.<p><b>Come home with me and refresh yourself</b><br>Jeroboam's invitation to the prophet to come home and refresh himself can be seen as an attempt to show hospitality, a valued cultural practice in the ancient Near East. However, it may also be interpreted as an attempt to bribe or coerce the prophet into aligning with the king's interests. In the broader biblical context, prophets often faced temptations to compromise their messages for personal gain or favor with powerful figures. This invitation tests the prophet's obedience to God's command, as he was instructed not to eat bread or drink water in that place (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>).<p><b>and I will give you a reward</b><br>Offering a reward to the prophet can be seen as an attempt by Jeroboam to manipulate or control the prophetic message. In biblical times, prophets were sometimes offered gifts or rewards for their services, but accepting such rewards could compromise their integrity and the purity of their message. This offer of a reward contrasts with the biblical principle that true prophets speak God's word without seeking personal gain. The prophet's refusal to accept the reward underscores his commitment to God's instructions and serves as a reminder of the dangers of materialism and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This refers to King Jeroboam of Israel, who had established idol worship in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>An unnamed prophet sent by God from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant location in the Northern Kingdom of Israel where Jeroboam set up one of the golden calves for worship, contrary to God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The altar at Bethel, which was the focal point of Jeroboam's idolatrous practices and the subject of the man of God's prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>The man of God prophesied against the altar, and as a sign, the altar was split apart.

The verse exposes how power and wealth try to tame the truth, yet true servants of the Lord must keep clear boundaries, refusing any alliance that dilutes or commodifies the word they carry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Come home with me . . .</span>--The invitation may have been in part the mark of some impression made on the king, and an impulse of gratitude for the restoration of his withered hand. Such was the request of Naaman to Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm" title="And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing of your servant.">2Kings 5:15</a>), though even this was emphatically refused. But it still savours of astute policy in Jeroboam: for the acceptance of hospitality and reward would in the eyes of the people imply a condonation of the idolatrous worship, which might well destroy or extenuate the impression made by the prophet's prediction. It indicates also--what experience of such men as "the old prophet" would have produced--a low idea of prophetic character and mission, not unlike that which is shown in Balak's treatment of Balaam. That such conceptions are perfectly compatible with a certain belief in the reality of a supernatural power in the prophet--although they, of course, derogate from its true sacredness--the monstrous request of Simon Magus (in <a href="/acts/8-19.htm" title="Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:19</a>) shows with the most startling clearness. It was evidently to provide against these things--as fatal to the effectiveness of the prophet's mission--that the prohibition of <a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm" title="For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you came.">1Kings 13:9</a> was given; nor could its general purpose have been easily misunderstood, either by the king or by the prophet himself. It is a curious coincidence that in his refusal he uses words strangely like the reluctant refusal of Balak's offer by Balaam (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm" title="And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.">Numbers 22:18</a>). The very strength of the language is suspicious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself</span> [with food, ablutions, etc. (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4, 5</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3</a>, etc.) We are hardly justified in seeing in these words (with Bahr and Keil) an attempt to "gain the prophet over to his side by friendliness," and to render his threat harmless in the eyes of the people. The king doubtless may have hoped that it would "blunt the edge of the prophet's denunciation of his schismatical altar" (Wordsworth); but this was not the object, or not the sole object, with which the invitation was given. Jeroboam could not possibly have done less, after the signal service the man of God had rendered him, than invite him to his palace. Eastern courtesy alone (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-24.htm">Genesis 43:24</a>, etc.) would require him to offer hospitality to his benefactor. And he could scarcely hope that any hospitalities would either neutralize the impression which the recent miracles had made, or win over to his side one who had a direct commission from the Most High to oppose him. With more reason, Wordsworth cites <a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>, "Honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people." A feeling of gratitude may have <span class="accented">prompted</span> the invitation, while the king at the same time was very sensible of the advantages which would accrue to himself if it were accepted], <span class="cmt_word">and I will give thee a reward</span>.
