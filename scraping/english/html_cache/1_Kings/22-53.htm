This reflects the deep influence of Jezebel, who was a Phoenician princess and a fervent worshiper of Baal. The worship of Baal was a direct violation of the first commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This idolatry was a significant issue in Israel, leading to spiritual and moral decline. The prophets, including Elijah and Elisha, were sent by God to confront this apostasy and call the people back to the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger</b><br>The phrase indicates that Ahaziah's actions were not just personal failings but were seen as a direct affront to God. In the covenant relationship between God and Israel, idolatry was considered spiritual adultery. The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting in judgment or disaster for the people. This divine anger is not capricious but is a response to the breach of covenant and the turning away from the true God. The prophets often warned of the consequences of such actions, emphasizing the need for repentance and return to God.<p><b>just as his father had done</b><br>Ahaziah's behavior is directly linked to that of his father, Ahab, who is described in the Bible as one of the most wicked kings of Israel. Ahab's reign was marked by the promotion of Baal worship, largely due to the influence of his wife, Jezebel. This phrase highlights the generational impact of sin and the failure to break away from the sinful patterns of one's predecessors. It serves as a reminder of the importance of godly leadership and the influence it can have on a nation. The narrative of Ahab and his descendants underscores the biblical principle that the sins of the fathers can affect subsequent generations, though each individual is responsible for their own actions (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Israel who followed in the sinful footsteps of his father, Ahab, by serving and worshiping Baal, a Canaanite deity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A false god worshiped in various forms across the ancient Near East, often associated with fertility and storms.
