In the biblical context, "evil in the sight of the LORD" often refers to idolatry and the abandonment of God's commandments. Omri's establishment of Samaria as the capital of the Northern Kingdom and his political alliances with surrounding nations, such as his marriage alliance with Phoenicia, contributed to the introduction and spread of Baal worship in Israel. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of leaders being judged by their adherence to God's laws.<p><b>and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.</b><br>This comparison highlights the increasing moral and spiritual decline of Israel's leadership. Omri's actions are seen as a continuation and intensification of the sins of Jeroboam, who led Israel into idolatry. The phrase suggests a cumulative effect of sin, where each successive leader's actions contribute to a deeper departure from God's ways. Historically, Omri's reign was significant for its political stability and economic prosperity, but these achievements were overshadowed by his spiritual failures. This pattern of increasing wickedness is a recurring theme in the narrative of the kings of Israel, emphasizing the need for repentance and return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/omri.htm">Omri</a></b><br>The sixth king of Israel, who reigned for 12 years.
