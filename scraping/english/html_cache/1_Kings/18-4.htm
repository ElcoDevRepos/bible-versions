Her influence led to the promotion of Baal worship in Israel, directly opposing the worship of Yahweh. The slaughter of the prophets of the LORD reflects her aggressive campaign to eradicate the worship of Yahweh and establish Baalism as the state religion. This act of persecution is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God's people face oppression, such as the persecution of early Christians in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3</a>).<p><b>Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them</b><br>Obadiah, a devout believer in Yahweh and the palace administrator under King Ahab, took a significant risk by protecting the prophets. His actions demonstrate courage and faithfulness amidst a hostile environment. This act of hiding the prophets can be compared to other biblical figures who protected God's people, such as Rahab hiding the Israelite spies (<a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2:1-7</a>). Obadiah's name, meaning "servant of the LORD," reflects his dedication to God despite the danger.<p><b>fifty men per cave</b><br>The use of caves as hiding places is consistent with the geographical and historical context of ancient Israel, where natural caves were often used for refuge and protection. The division into two groups of fifty may have been a strategic decision to minimize risk and ensure survival. This division also echoes the organization seen in other biblical narratives, such as the division of the Israelites into groups during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>).<p><b>providing them with food and water</b><br>Obadiah's provision of food and water highlights the practical aspects of his support and the logistical challenges involved in sustaining a large group in hiding. This act of provision is reminiscent of God's provision for Elijah through the ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-6.htm">1 Kings 17:6</a>) and later through the widow of Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9-16</a>).

It may probably have followed on the denunciation of judgment; and Elijah's retirement to Cherith and Zarephath may have been a means of escape from it. If Elijah's oft-repeated phrase, "I, even I, alone remain," is to be taken literally, Obadiah's merciful interposition must have availed only for a time, or have simply given opportunity of escape.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophets of the Lord</span> [Our author now instances a proof of Obadiah's devotion. The incident to which he refers is otherwise unknown to us, nor can we refer it with certainty to its proper place in the history. But it is extremely probable that this work of extermination was begun as an act of reprisals for the drought denounced by Elijah. Ver. 13 almost implies that it had taken place during his absence. We see here, consequently, an additional reason for his flight (cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>).

It has been suggested that these caves were in the sides of Mount Carmel; there are large caves under the western cliffs (Stanley); more than two thousand, according to others; "often of great length and extremely tortuous" (Dic. Bib. 1. p. 278); but this is mere guesswork, as Palestine, being of limestone formation, abounds in caverns. See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 151, 52.
