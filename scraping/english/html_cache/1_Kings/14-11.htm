In ancient Near Eastern culture, a proper burial was considered essential for honoring the dead, and the lack of it was seen as a curse or disgrace. Dogs, often seen as scavengers in biblical times, consuming the dead signifies a complete dishonor and divine judgment. This prophecy reflects the consequences of Jeroboam's idolatry and rebellion against God, as he led Israel into sin by establishing golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). The imagery of dogs eating the dead is also used elsewhere in Scripture to denote divine judgment, such as in the case of Jezebel (<a href="/2_kings/9-36.htm">2 Kings 9:36</a>).<p><b>and anyone who dies in the field will be eaten by the birds of the air.</b><br>This part of the prophecy extends the judgment to those who die outside the city, emphasizing that no one in Jeroboam's line will escape disgrace, whether in urban or rural settings. Birds of the air consuming the dead further underscores the totality of the curse, as it was a sign of being abandoned by God and left to the elements. This imagery is reminiscent of the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where disobedience to God would result in bodies being left unburied and consumed by birds and beasts. The use of such vivid imagery serves to highlight the seriousness of Jeroboam's sin and the inevitable consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>For the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and authority of the prophecy. When the LORD speaks, it is a declaration of His sovereign will and purpose, which cannot be thwarted. The fulfillment of this prophecy is a testament to God's faithfulness to His word, both in blessing and in judgment. It serves as a reminder of the divine authority behind the prophetic message and the assurance that God's justice will prevail. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's word being powerful and effective, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where it is stated that God's word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The "dogs" are the half-wild' dogs, the scavengers of every Eastern city; the "fowls of the air" the vultures and other birds of prey. In ancient times the natural horror of insult to the remains of the dead was often intensified by the idea, that in some way the denial of the rites of burial would inflict suffering or privation on the departed soul. Whether such ideas may have lingered in the minds of the Israelites we have no means of knowing. But certainly their whole system of law and ritual was calculated to give due honour to the body in life, as consecrated to God; and this would naturally tend to teach them that the body was a part of the true man, and therefore to deepen the repugnance, with which all reverent feeling regards outrage on the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that dieth of Jeroboam</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span> Jeroboam, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, belonging to, of the house cf.
