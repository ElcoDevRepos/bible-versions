This is not the first encounter Elijah has with divine intervention; it emphasizes God's persistent care and attention. The repetition of the angel's visit underscores the importance of the message and the necessity of Elijah's mission. In biblical narratives, the number two often signifies confirmation or establishment of a matter (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>).<p><b>and touched him</b><br>The act of touching signifies personal care and compassion. In the Bible, touch is often associated with healing and restoration (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>). This physical contact reassures Elijah of God's presence and support, providing comfort and strength. It also highlights the tangible nature of God's provision, not just spiritual but physical.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Get up and eat,</b><br>The command to "get up and eat" is practical, addressing Elijah's immediate physical needs. It reflects the biblical principle that God cares for the whole person, both body and spirit. This mirrors Jesus' ministry, where He often met physical needs alongside spiritual teaching (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>). The provision of food is reminiscent of God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>or the journey will be too much for you.&#8221;</b><br>The journey refers to Elijah's upcoming travel to Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, a significant location where Moses received the Ten Commandments. This journey is both physical and spiritual, symbolizing a deeper encounter with God. The warning implies that without divine sustenance, Elijah would not be able to fulfill his prophetic mission. It highlights human dependency on God's strength, a theme echoed in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where believers are reminded that they can do all things through Christ who strengthens them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who had just experienced a great victory over the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel but is now fleeing for his life from Queen Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to provide sustenance and encouragement to Elijah during his time of despair.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desolate place where Elijah finds himself, both physically and spiritually, as he flees from Jezebel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_horeb.htm">Mount Horeb</a></b><br>The destination Elijah is journeying towards, also known as Mount Sinai, a place of significant encounters with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The queen who threatens Elijah's life, representing opposition to God's prophets and His will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision_in_despair.htm">Divine Provision in Despair</a></b><br>God provides for our needs even when we feel overwhelmed and alone.

After fleeing to the wilderness in fear (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>), Elijah had already received food and encouragement once, yet the Lord graciously comes again.<p>- Similar divine persistence is seen when God calls Samuel repeatedly (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4-10</a>) and when Jesus restores Peter three times (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p>- The Lord&#8217;s willingness to come &#8220;a second time&#8221; assures believers that He does not abandon His servants after a single act of mercy; He continues to pursue, sustain, and restore.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the angel of the LORD</b><p>- This &#8220;angel&#8221; appears throughout Scripture as God&#8217;s personal messenger, often speaking with divine authority (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11-12</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>).<p>- In Elijah&#8217;s moment of despair, the presence of the angel underscores that God Himself is attending to the prophet&#8217;s needs, not outsourcing care to a lesser being.<p>- The same compassionate presence is promised to all believers: &#8220;Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>returned and touched him</b><p>- The angel&#8217;s physical touch conveys tenderness and immediate care, much like Jesus later touching the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>) and Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>).<p>- This tangible gesture cuts through Elijah&#8217;s isolation, reminding him he is not alone.<p>- God still reaches weary hearts through personal, concrete expressions of His love&#8212;sometimes through His Word, sometimes through fellow believers acting as His hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- God communicates plainly; He does not leave Elijah guessing.<p>- Throughout Scripture, divine speech follows divine action, clarifying purpose (e.g., <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4-6</a>).<p>- The Word of God remains the believer&#8217;s sure guide, illuminating what His touch and provision are meant to accomplish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Get up and eat&#8221;</b><p>- The command is practical: Elijah must rise and receive sustenance. Spiritual renewal often begins with obedience in simple, physical steps (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2-3</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>).<p>- God supplies the provision (bread and water, <a href="/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a>), yet Elijah must actively partake.<p>- For Christians today, the call echoes in daily disciplines&#8212;reading Scripture, praying, gathering with the saints&#8212;means provided by God to restore strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;or the journey will be too much for you.&#8221;</b><p>- God knows the path ahead: forty days to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>). Without divine nourishment, Elijah would collapse.<p>- The warning mirrors Jesus&#8217; counsel to the disciples: &#8220;The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>).<p>- Believers face journeys&#8212;temptations, trials, callings&#8212;that exceed natural strength; divine provision is not optional but essential (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/19-7.htm">1 Kings 19:7</a> reveals God&#8217;s tender persistence, personal presence, practical provision, clear instruction, and protective foresight. He meets Elijah in weakness, touches him, speaks plainly, supplies what is needed, and warns of the limits of human strength. The verse assures every follower of Christ that the Lord still draws near &#8220;a second time,&#8221; equips for the road ahead, and sustains those who rise, obey, and partake of His gracious provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to awaken him.
