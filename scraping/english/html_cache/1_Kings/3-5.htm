It was known for its high place, where Solomon offered sacrifices. The significance of Gibeon in this context is tied to its role as a central worship site before the temple was built in Jerusalem. Historically, Gibeon was a Canaanite city that made a treaty with Israel during Joshua's conquest (Joshua 9). The choice of Gibeon as the location for this divine encounter underscores its religious importance at the time.<p><b>the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream</b><br>Dreams were a common means of divine communication in the ancient Near East, and the Bible records several instances where God spoke to individuals through dreams (e.g., Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-10</a>). This appearance to Solomon highlights the personal relationship between God and the king, emphasizing God's willingness to guide and direct those in leadership. The use of a dream also indicates the supernatural nature of the encounter, setting the stage for the significant request Solomon is about to make.<p><b>and God said, &#8220;Ask, and I will give it to you!&#8221;</b><br>This invitation from God is a pivotal moment in Solomon's life and reign. It reflects God's grace and willingness to bless Solomon, offering him a unique opportunity to request anything he desires. This moment is reminiscent of God's covenant promises to David, Solomon's father, where God assured David of His steadfast love and support for his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Solomon's response to this offer, asking for wisdom, is a key moment that defines his reign and is often seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). Solomon's request and God's subsequent granting of wisdom also fulfill the prophetic and typological role of a wise and discerning king, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel.

This highlights Solomon&#8217;s devotion and sets the context for God&#8217;s response.<p>&#8226; Similar moments when God met His servants after sacrifice include Abraham at Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-15.htm">Genesis 22:15-18</a>) and Elijah on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>), underscoring that wholehearted worship invites divine encounter.<p>&#8226; &#8220;One night&#8221; reminds us that God can break into the ordinary rhythms of life unexpectedly, echoing Jacob&#8217;s nighttime vision at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream</b><p>&#8226; The text states plainly that &#8220;the LORD appeared,&#8221; affirming the reality of supernatural revelation (cf. <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Dreams were a recognized means by which God delivered messages&#8212;Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1-16</a>) and Daniel in Babylon (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Although dreams can occur naturally, Scripture distinguishes those initiated by God; here, the encounter is from &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; verifying its authenticity (<a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; This appearance demonstrates personal relationship: the covenant God of Israel engages directly with the king, fulfilling promises to David his father (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and God said</b><p>&#8226; The narrative shifts from appearance to speech, highlighting that God not only reveals Himself but also communicates clearly (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine speech carries authority and creative power&#8212;as at creation (&#8220;God said&#8230;,&#8221; <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>) and in prophetic callings (&#8220;the word of the LORD came,&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s initiative precedes Solomon&#8217;s response. This grace-first pattern mirrors God&#8217;s approach to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4-10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Ask, and I will give it to you!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The invitation is open-ended: Solomon is granted freedom to request anything. Comparable offers are rare but include Elijah&#8217;s mantle to Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise &#8220;I will give&#8221; reflects God&#8217;s generosity and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;Ask&#8221; anticipates Jesus&#8217; teaching, &#8220;Ask, and it will be given to you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>), showing continuity in God&#8217;s willingness to bless those who seek Him.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s offer tests the king&#8217;s heart. Solomon&#8217;s subsequent request for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>) proves that true discernment values spiritual gifts over material gain (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a> records a real, nighttime encounter at Gibeon in which God graciously appears to Solomon through a dream, initiates conversation, and offers to grant his request. The verse underscores God&#8217;s responsiveness to sincere worship, His sovereign initiative in revealing Himself, and His generous readiness to bless. It sets the stage for Solomon&#8217;s renowned plea for wisdom, illustrating that divine invitations are designed to draw believers into deeper dependence on the LORD and alignment with His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The Lord appeared</span>.--This direct communication to Solomon by a dream--standing in contrast with the indirect knowledge of the Lord's will by David through the prophets Nathan and Gad (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-2.htm" title="That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.">2Samuel 7:2-17</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David.

At the same time it is to be noted that the vision of the Lord through dreams, being of a lower type than the waking vision, is mostly recorded as given to those outside the Covenant, as Abimelech (<a href="/context/genesis/20-3.htm" title="But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you are but a dead man, for the woman which you have taken; for she is a man's wife.">Genesis 20:3-7</a>), Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm" title="And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.">Genesis 31:24</a>), Pharaoh and his servants (<a href="/genesis/40-5.htm" title="And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.">Genesis 40:5</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/41-1.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.">Genesis 41:1-8</a>), the Midianite (<a href="/judges/7-13.htm" title="And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.">Judges 7:13</a>), and Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-1.htm" title="And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.">Daniel 2:1</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/4-10.htm" title="Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.">Daniel 4:10-18</a>); as belonging to the early stages of revelation, to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-12.htm" title="And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and, see, an horror of great darkness fell on him.">Genesis 15:12</a>), Jacob (<a href="/context/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12-15</a>), and Joseph (<a href="/context/genesis/37-5.htm" title="And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brothers: and they hated him yet the more.">Genesis 37:5-10</a>); and as marking the time of cessation of the regular succession of the prophets during the Captivity (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm" title="Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision.
