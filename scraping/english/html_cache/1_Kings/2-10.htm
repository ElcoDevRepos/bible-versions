The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, indicating that David joined his ancestors in the afterlife. This reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of the soul, a concept that is further developed in later biblical texts. David's death marks the end of an era, as he was the second king of Israel and established Jerusalem as its capital. His reign is often seen as a golden age for Israel, and his legacy is significant in both Jewish and Christian traditions. The phrase also connects to the idea of a peaceful death, suggesting that David's life and reign were completed according to God's plan.<p><b>and was buried in the City of David.</b><br>The "City of David" refers to Jerusalem, specifically the southeastern part of the city, which David captured from the Jebusites and established as his capital. This area is historically and archaeologically significant, as it became the political and spiritual center of Israel. David's burial in the City of David underscores his importance and the centrality of Jerusalem in Israelite identity. It also fulfills the cultural practice of burying kings within their own city, signifying honor and respect. The location of David's tomb has been a subject of interest and debate, with some archaeological evidence suggesting possible sites. This burial site also prefigures the significance of Jerusalem in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Son of David," highlighting the messianic lineage and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who united the tribes of Israel and established Jerusalem as the nation's capital.
