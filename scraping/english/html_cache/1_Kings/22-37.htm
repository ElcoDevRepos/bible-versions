Ahab's death fulfills the prophecy given by the prophet Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17-28</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>) regarding his demise. Ahab's death in battle against the Arameans at Ramoth-gilead marks the end of his reign, which was characterized by idolatry and conflict with the prophets of Yahweh. His death serves as a divine judgment for his disobedience and the influence of his wife, Jezebel, in leading Israel into Baal worship.<p><b>and was brought to Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, established by Ahab's father, King Omri. It was a significant city both politically and religiously, often associated with the worship of foreign gods due to Ahab's marriage to Jezebel. The transportation of Ahab's body to Samaria signifies the return of the king to his royal city, where he had established his rule and built a palace. This act of bringing the king back to the capital for burial reflects the common practice of honoring a king by interring him in the city of his reign.<p><b>where they buried him</b><br>The burial of Ahab in Samaria indicates the continuation of royal customs despite his ignominious death. Burial practices in ancient Israel were significant, often involving family tombs or burial sites within the city. Ahab's burial in Samaria, despite his failures and the judgment pronounced upon him, underscores the respect for the office of the king. This burial also contrasts with the fate of Jezebel, whose body was left unburied as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/9-36.htm">2 Kings 9:36-37</a>), highlighting the differing ends of the king and queen.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahab.htm">King Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel who died in battle as prophesied by the prophet Micaiah.
