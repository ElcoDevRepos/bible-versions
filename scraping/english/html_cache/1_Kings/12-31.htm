This was contrary to the centralization of worship that God commanded in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>, where He instructed that sacrifices should be made only at the place He chose. Jeroboam's decision to establish these shrines was a direct challenge to the religious reforms of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, which was the designated place for worship. This act of building high places was a significant step in leading the northern kingdom of Israel into idolatry, as it encouraged the people to worship outside of the prescribed manner and location.<p><b>and appointed from every class of people priests</b><br>In appointing priests from every class of people, Jeroboam broke with the Mosaic Law, which specified that only the descendants of Levi, and specifically the family of Aaron, were to serve as priests (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>, <a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). This democratization of the priesthood undermined the established religious order and was a move to consolidate his political power by creating a new religious system that was loyal to him. This action can be seen as a rejection of God's ordained structure for worship and leadership, leading to spiritual decline and confusion among the people.<p><b>who were not Levites</b><br>The appointment of non-Levites as priests was a significant violation of the covenantal laws given to Israel. The Levites were set apart for service to God, and their role was integral to maintaining the purity and holiness of worship (<a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>). By choosing priests who were not Levites, Jeroboam not only disregarded God's commands but also set a precedent for further religious corruption. This act foreshadowed the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom, as it strayed further from God's laws. The New Testament echoes the importance of proper spiritual leadership, as seen in the qualifications for church leaders in <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3</a> and <a href="/titus/1.htm">Titus 1</a>, emphasizing the need for adherence to God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The verse warns us that worship must follow God&#8217;s revealed pattern, not personal or cultural preference, and that spiritual leadership must be grounded in God&#8217;s calling, not human appointment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31, 32) <span class= "bld">Of the lowest of the people.</span>--This is universally recognised as a mistranslation, though a natural one, of the original, "the ends of the people."

It is hardly likely that the king would have lacked because at Dan an unauthorised Levitical priesthood was (as has been said) forthcoming.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made an house of high places</span> [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al.</span> after Josephus) that Jeroboam built <span class="accented">two</span> temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the "house of high places" with the "house of the Lord." Ewald, too, after <a href="/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29, 32</a>, understands the words as <span class="accented">plural</span>. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at <span class="accented">Bethel</span> (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>). This "house of high places" has grown in Ewald's pages into "a splendid temple in Canaanite style"], <span class="cmt_word">and made priests of the lowest of the people</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "<span class="accented">from the ends</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from all classes, <span class="accented">ex</span> <span class="accented">universe populo</span> (Gesen.), and not, as the writer explains presently, from the tribe of Levi alone. <a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4</a>, <a href="/judges/18-20.htm">Judges 18:20</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2</a>, prove this to be the correct interpretation of the word. Rawlinson, who remarks that "Jeroboam could have no motive for specially selecting persons of low condition," does not thereby dispose of the A.V. rendering, for the historian might mean that <span class="accented">some</span> of Jeroboam's priests were of the lowest stamp, because he could find no others, or because he was so little scrupulous as to take them. "Leaden priests are well fitted to golden deities" (Hall)], <span class="cmt_word">which were not of the sons of Levi.</span> [Jeroboam would doubtless have been only too glad to have retained the services of the Levitical priests, but they went over in a body to Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13</a>). The statement of ver. 14, that, "Jeroboam and his sons" had "cast them out," suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions. The idea of Stanley, that "following the precedent of the deposition of Abiathar by Solomon, he removed from their places the whole of the sacerdotal order," is a wild conjecture for which Scripture affords not the slightest warrant.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jeroboam also built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
