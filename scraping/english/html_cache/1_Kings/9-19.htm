These cities were likely fortified locations where supplies, particularly for his chariots and horses, were stored. This indicates the importance of maintaining a strong military presence and infrastructure. The use of chariots and horses was a significant advancement in warfare during this period, and Solomon's investment in them underscores his commitment to national security and regional influence. This aligns with <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, which mentions Solomon's 4,000 stalls for chariot horses and 12,000 horses, highlighting the scale of his military resources.<p><b>whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem,</b><br>Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Israel, was the focal point of Solomon's building projects. His desire to build in Jerusalem included not only the Temple and his palace but also other significant structures that would enhance the city's status and functionality. This reflects Solomon's role as a king who sought to glorify God through monumental architecture, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6-7</a>, where the construction of the Temple and the royal palace is detailed. The emphasis on "whatever he desired" suggests Solomon's unparalleled authority and resources, allowing him to fulfill his vision for the city.<p><b>Lebanon,</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its cedar trees, which were highly valued for construction, particularly in the building of the Temple and Solomon's palace. The alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, facilitated the acquisition of these materials, as described in <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-10</a>. Lebanon's inclusion in Solomon's building projects indicates the extent of his influence and the importance of international relations in securing resources. The use of Lebanese cedar symbolizes strength and durability, qualities that Solomon sought to embody in his kingdom.<p><b>and throughout the land of his dominion.</b><br>Solomon's dominion extended beyond the traditional borders of Israel, encompassing a vast territory that required administrative and infrastructural development. His building projects throughout the land demonstrate his efforts to consolidate power and ensure the prosperity of his kingdom. This expansion is consistent with the promises made to David regarding the extent of his descendants' rule, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.

The text seems evidently to refer to these, in contradistinction from the cities of commercial and military importance previously mentioned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the cities of store that Solomon had</span> [cities where the produce of the land was stored for the use of the troops or household, or against a season of scarcity (<a href="/genesis/41-35.htm">Genesis 41:35</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a>), or possibly (Ewald) they were emporiums for the development of trade. The fact that these store cities are mentioned in the same breath with Tadmor, is an argument for the identification of that place with Palmyra, which Solomon could only have built as a means of gaining or retaining control over the caravan trade between the East and the Mediterranean. Cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, and <a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48</a>. They would seem to have been chiefly on the northern frontier, <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a> ("in Hamath"), <span class="accented">ib</span>. <a href="/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a> speaks of "the store cities of <span class="accented">Napthali</span>." It should be remembered that Solomon had an adversary in Damascus], <span class="cmt_word">and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen</span> [Cf. <a href="/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>. These were not so much fortresses (vers. 15-18) as places adapted to accommodate his cavalry, etc. For <span class="accented">horsemen</span> we should perhaps read <span class="accented">horses</span>. See note on 1 Kings 5:6], <span class="cmt_word">and that which Solomon desired to build</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and the desire of Solomon which he desired</span>; cf. ver. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The use of the cognate verb refutes the idea that Solomon's "desire" is another name for pleasure buildings or pleasaunces, as does also "desire" in ver. 11. It is certain, however, that such buildings were erected, and it is probable that they are referred to here] <span class="cmt_word">in Jerusalem and in Lebanon</span> [It is highly probable that pleasure houses were built in Lebanon (<a href="/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), for which Solomon may well have had a strong affection, and pleasure gardens in Jerusalem (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:4-7</a>). See Stanley, pp. 197-199); and we may reasonably imagine (with Ewald) that in these latter he sought to grow specimens of the plants, etc., about which he "spoke" (ch. 4:33; cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>). "It is a curious fact that in the ground hard by the 'fountains of Solomon' near Bethlehem, which exhibit manifest traces of an ancient garden, and where the intimations of Josephus would lead us to suppose that Solomon had a rural retreat, are still to be found a number of plants self sown from age to age, which do not exist in any other part of the Holy Land" (Kitto, "Bib. Illus." vol. 4. p. 101). Some of Solomon's journeys to these favourite resorts, we can hardly doubt, are referred to in <a href="/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6-10</a>; <a href="/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> sqq.;
