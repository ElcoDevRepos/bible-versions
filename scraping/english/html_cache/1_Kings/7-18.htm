These pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, stood at the entrance of the temple, symbolizing strength and stability. The use of pillars in ancient architecture often represented support and grandeur, reflecting the temple's significance as a place of worship and the dwelling of God's presence.<p><b>with two rows of pomegranates</b><br>Pomegranates were a common decorative motif in ancient Near Eastern art and architecture, symbolizing fertility, abundance, and blessing. In the context of the temple, they may also represent the fruitfulness of the land promised to Israel. The use of pomegranates in the temple's design connects to the high priest's robe, which was adorned with pomegranates and bells (<a href="/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>), signifying holiness and the priestly role in mediating between God and the people.<p><b>around each grating</b><br>The grating refers to the network or latticework that adorned the capitals of the pillars. This intricate design not only added to the aesthetic beauty of the temple but also demonstrated the craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into its construction. The grating may have served a practical purpose in supporting the decorative elements, while also symbolizing the interconnectedness of the temple's various parts, much like the unity of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>to cover each capital</b><br>The capitals were the crowning features of the pillars, often elaborately decorated to signify importance and authority. Covering the capitals with pomegranates and other designs highlighted the temple's sacredness and the glory of God. In biblical symbolism, the capital can be seen as representing the head or leadership, pointing to Christ as the head of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<p><b>atop the pillars</b><br>The placement of the capitals atop the pillars signifies their role as the highest point of the structure, drawing the eye upward and directing attention to the heavens. This architectural feature serves as a reminder of the transcendence of God and the aspiration of the worshiper to reach towards the divine. The pillars, with their capitals, can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both the foundation and the pinnacle of our faith (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.
