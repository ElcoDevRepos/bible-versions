The mention of his mother being a widow may indicate a challenging upbringing, as widows in ancient Israel often faced economic hardships. The tribe of Naphtali was known for its valor and strength, as seen in the blessing of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>. This connection to Naphtali may suggest a heritage of resilience and skill.<p><b>and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze</b><br>Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its skilled artisans and craftsmen, particularly in metalwork. The mention of Huram's father being from Tyre underscores the blending of Israelite and Phoenician cultures, which was common during Solomon's reign due to alliances and trade. This mixed heritage may have contributed to Huram's expertise in bronze work, as Tyre was renowned for its advanced techniques in metallurgy.<p><b>Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work</b><br>This description of Huram's abilities highlights the divine gifting and wisdom that were highly valued in the construction of the temple. The triad of "skill, understanding, and knowledge" echoes the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, which attributes such qualities to the fear of the Lord. Huram's expertise in bronze work was crucial for the temple's construction, as bronze was used extensively for the altar, basins, and other temple furnishings.<p><b>So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work</b><br>Huram's collaboration with King Solomon signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding the building of the temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>). Solomon's ability to enlist skilled workers like Huram reflects his wisdom and the prosperity of his reign. This partnership also symbolizes the unity and cooperation between Israel and its neighboring nations during Solomon's time, which was essential for the temple's completion. The successful execution of Huram's work can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfills the work of building the spiritual temple, the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram.htm">Hiram</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman in bronze, Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and a man from Tyre.

For in the first place it is not absolutely necessary to understand by Dan the tribe of that name. It may well refer to the town, formerly Leshem (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>), or Laish (<a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7, 27</a>), colonised by the Danites, and thenceforward bearing their name (ver. 29), which was situated within the borders of Naphtali. If, however, it is preferred to see in the "daughters of Dan" a tribal reference, we may suppose (with Keil, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that the woman was originally a Danite, but became, through her first husband, "of the tribe of Naphtali." But the first explanation is the more simple and obvious], <span class="cmt_word">and his father was a man of Tyre</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Hiram was the son (not stepson, or adopted son, as the Rabbins) of a mixed marriage. In earlier times Laish had but little intercourse with the Zidonians (<a href="/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>). It is nowhere stated that the inhabitants were of Phoenician extraction; nor can it be justly inferred from this passage], <span class="cmt_word">a worker in brass</span> [or <span class="accented">copper.</span> Brass is a compound of copper and zinc; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> originally and strictly signifies a pure metal (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>, etc.; <a href="/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>). There were copper mines in Palestine, and the art of working this metal was known at a very remote period (<a href="/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>, Hebrews, and see Wilkinson's "Ancient Egypt," vol. 3. p. 243; and De Rougemont, "Age du Bronze," p. 180). In later times the word sometimes denoted brass (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), or copper-bronze Ca mixture of copper and tin). Cf. <a href="/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>. From <a href="/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> we learn that Hiram was "skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber," etc. From the mention of brass only in this passage, and in ver. 45, it has been somewhat hastily concluded that "the work that he personally did for Solomon" was "limited to works in brass" (Rawlinson). It is, perhaps, safer to say that brass only is mentioned here, because the following section treats exclusively of the brazen ornaments, etc., of the sanctuary (Keil). It would almost seem, however (see note on ver. 48), as if he was not employed to make the vessels of gold. Nor does this supposition really contradict the statement made below, viz., that he wrought all Solomon's work]: <span class="cmt_word">and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning</span> [or <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, as the same word is rendered <a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>, where similar language is used of Bezaleel. It is noticeable, however, that the words "filled with the spirit of God," used of the Hebrew, are not applied to the Tyrian workman] <span class="cmt_word">to work all works in brass.
