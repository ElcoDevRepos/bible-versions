The act of "going up" often signifies moving to a place of higher status or importance, such as ascending to the throne. This procession would likely involve key figures like priests and prophets, emphasizing the divine approval and communal support for the new king.<p><b>and he is to come and sit on my throne</b><br>Sitting on the throne symbolizes the transfer of royal authority and legitimacy. In the context of 1 Kings, this is King David's throne, representing the continuation of the Davidic dynasty. The throne is not just a physical seat but a symbol of God's covenant with David, promising that his descendants would rule Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and reign in my place</b><br>This phrase underscores the transition of power from David to Solomon. It highlights the continuity of leadership and the fulfillment of God's promise to David. The concept of reigning "in my place" also suggests a stewardship under God's ultimate kingship, as earthly kings were seen as God's representatives.<p><b>For I have appointed him</b><br>The appointment of Solomon is portrayed as divinely ordained, reflecting the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in choosing leaders. This echoes other instances in Scripture where God selects individuals for specific purposes, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and David himself (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>). It underscores the belief that true authority comes from God.<p><b>ruler over Israel and Judah</b><br>This phrase indicates the united monarchy under Solomon, encompassing all the tribes of Israel. Historically, this period is marked by political stability and prosperity. The mention of both Israel and Judah foreshadows the later division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12), highlighting the significance of unity under a divinely appointed king. Solomon's rule is also seen as a type of Christ's future reign, where Jesus is prophesied to unite and rule over all nations (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel who is making arrangements for his succession.

In the case of David himself, it may be observed that the record of his accession to royalty over Israel contains the notice of "a league" made by him with the elders of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2Samuel 5:3</a>), to which there is nothing to correspond in the account of his becoming king over Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm" title="And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.">2Samuel 2:4</a>). This perhaps indicates from the beginning a less absolute rule over the other tribes. Certainly the history of the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm" title="But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.">2Samuel 15:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm" title="And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.">2Samuel 15:13</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/18-6.htm" title="So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;">2Samuel 18:6-7</a>), the disputes about the restoration of David (<a href="/context/2_samuel/19-41.htm" title="And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?">2Samuel 19:41-43</a>), and the attempt of Sheba to take advantage of them (<a href="/context/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1-2</a>), show a looser allegiance of Israel than of Judah to the house of David. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come up</span> (after him [not in the LXX.

It is more probable, however, that "Israel and Judah" was even then the current designation of the two component parts of the realm (see <a href="/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11, 41</a>, etc.). Besides, we can hardly suppose that the historian has in every case, though he probably has in this, preserved the exact words of the speaker; and it need cause us no surprise had he put into David's mouth the phraseology of a later age.
