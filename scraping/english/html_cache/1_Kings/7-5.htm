Rectangular frames provided structural stability and were a common feature in ancient Near Eastern architecture. This design choice may symbolize order and precision, reflecting the divine order that Solomon sought to establish in his kingdom. The temple, as a place of worship, was meant to reflect the perfection and holiness of God, and the precise construction details underscore this intention.<p><b>with the openings facing one another</b><br>The arrangement of the doorways with openings facing one another suggests a sense of symmetry and balance, which was important in ancient architecture. This design facilitated movement and communication within the building, allowing for a harmonious flow of people and activities. In a spiritual sense, this could symbolize the interconnectedness of the various aspects of worship and daily life, emphasizing that all parts of life should be oriented towards God. The alignment of the doorways may also reflect the unity and coherence of God's creation, as seen in the orderly structure of the universe.<p><b>in three tiers</b><br>The mention of "three tiers" indicates a layered or multi-level design, which was a sophisticated architectural feature for the time. The number three often holds symbolic significance in the Bible, representing completeness and divine perfection. This could be seen as a reflection of the triune nature of God, though the concept of the Trinity is more fully developed in the New Testament. The three tiers may also symbolize the heavens, the earth, and the underworld, or the three parts of the temple: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. This tiered structure would have added to the grandeur and majesty of Solomon's building projects, underscoring the glory and splendor of God's dwelling place among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.

Scripture records this detail to underline God&#8217;s concern for order and completeness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). Just as the doors to the temple sanctuary were crafted with equal care (<a href="/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-33</a>), so the palace&#8217;s doors matched one another, reflecting uniformity in God&#8217;s work through Solomon.<p>&#8226; The text shows purposeful planning, not random artistry.<p>&#8226; Every doorway pointed to a consistent standard, echoing the unchanging character of the Lord (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting &#8220;all,&#8221; the verse reminds us that obedience is comprehensive; every part of life matters to God (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had rectangular frames</b><p>The specifies &#8220;rectangular frames,&#8221; highlighting the exact shape God chose to record. These frames supplied strength and visual clarity, much like the &#8220;four-sided doorposts of olive wood&#8221; in the temple (<a href="/1_kings/6-33.htm">1 Kings 6:33</a>). Literal, geometric lines speak of stability:<p>&#8226; Rectangles create right angles&#8212;symbols of reliability and fairness (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Strong frames kept the cedar doors true, so they would not warp over time (<a href="/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The precision echoes the detailed craftsmanship of Bezalel in the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With the openings facing one another</b><p>Each doorway looked directly across to another, forming perfectly aligned vistas through the great hall. This arrangement echoed the symmetry seen in the temple&#8217;s cherubim, whose wings touched &#8220;tip to tip&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/6-27.htm">1 Kings 6:27</a>):<p>&#8226; Straight sightlines fostered unity and openness, a physical picture of walking &#8220;in the light&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Aligned openings also aided ventilation and movement, serving the king&#8217;s household efficiently (<a href="/1_kings/10-4.htm">1 Kings 10:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Such symmetry anticipates the ordered gates of the New Jerusalem, where &#8220;the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In three tiers</b><p>The design rose in &#8220;three tiers,&#8221; or three rows, matching the three-story pattern already mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/7-4.htm">1 Kings 7:4</a>.

We should then get the sense of "doors and windows "] were square of beam. [The word translated "windows" in ver. 4; the proper rendering is <span class="accented">beam</span>, and the meaning apparently is that all these openings were square in shape. Nothing is said about the height of the rooms, and as the commentators are not agreed whether there was one story or three, that can obviously be only matter of conjecture. Rawlinson, who thinks of but one hall, with three rows of windows, supposes, after Houbigant, that one row was placed in a wall which ran down the middle of the apartment. Such an arrangement, he observes, was found by Layard at Nimrud.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
