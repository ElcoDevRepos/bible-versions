Prophets often delivered messages through symbolic actions. This reflects the seriousness of the message and the need for obedience to God's commands. Prophets in Israel were known to perform unusual acts to convey God's word, similar to how Isaiah walked naked and barefoot (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-3</a>) or how Ezekiel lay on his side for 390 days (<a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Strike me, please!&#8221;</b><br>The request to be struck is unusual but serves a prophetic purpose. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, physical actions often accompanied prophetic messages to illustrate a point or to symbolize a future event. The prophet's request is a test of obedience, both for himself and for the man he addresses. This act foreshadows the judgment that will come upon King Ahab for his disobedience in sparing Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram.<p><b>So the man struck him</b><br>The man&#8217;s compliance with the prophet&#8217;s request demonstrates obedience to God's command, even when it seems irrational. This obedience contrasts with King Ahab's disobedience earlier in the chapter. The act of striking the prophet is a necessary step in the unfolding of God's message to Ahab. It highlights the importance of following divine instructions, no matter how strange they may appear.<p><b>and wounded him</b><br>The wounding of the prophet is significant as it sets the stage for the prophet's disguise and subsequent confrontation with King Ahab. The wound serves as a physical manifestation of the impending judgment on Ahab for his failure to execute God&#8217;s command regarding Ben-Hadad. This act of wounding can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was wounded for the transgressions of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). The prophet's wound symbolizes the consequences of disobedience and the seriousness of God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet.htm">The Prophet</a></b><br>A man of God who is delivering a message through a symbolic act.

He is actively seeking an instrument for God&#8217;s visual message, much like Nathan sought David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a> to confront sin.<p>- It reminds us that when one person declines God&#8217;s call, the Lord raises up another (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>; <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and said, &#8216;Strike me, please!&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>- The polite &#8220;please&#8221; shows the prophet is not coercing; he invites voluntary participation, echoing God&#8217;s own appeals for willing obedience (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-19</a>).<p>- The command to be struck seems odd, yet throughout Scripture God often uses startling acts to grab attention&#8212;Isaiah walked barefoot (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-4</a>); Ezekiel lay on his side (<a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-8</a>); Hosea married Gomer (<a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p>- The prophet&#8217;s request anticipates the need to look convincingly wounded so Ahab will listen, underscoring that God plans every detail for maximum impact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;So the man struck him and wounded him&#8221;</b><p>- Unlike the first man, this second companion obeys instantly, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>, &#8220;He who respects a command will be rewarded.&#8221;<p>- The wound is real, not staged; Scripture records it plainly. Physical pain becomes the prophet&#8217;s badge of authority&#8212;similar to Paul&#8217;s &#8220;marks of the Lord Jesus&#8221; in <a href="/galatians/6-17.htm">Galatians 6:17</a>.<p>- Obedience sometimes hurts, yet God uses that hurt for higher purpose (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prophetic significance</b><p>- The injury enables the prophet to disguise himself before Ahab (v.38), creating a courtroom-style scenario where Ahab will condemn himself, like David with Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5-7</a>).<p>- The whole incident sets up God&#8217;s verdict on Ahab for sparing Ben-hadad (v.42). God&#8217;s messenger had to look like a wounded soldier so the king would not recognize him and would listen objectively.<p>- The episode demonstrates that when God&#8217;s people dabble with mercy toward sin while ignoring God&#8217;s justice, judgment follows (<a href="/1_kings/22-34.htm">1 Kings 22:34-38</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Takeaways for believers</b><p>- Delayed or partial obedience is disobedience; the first companion became a cautionary tale (v.36; <a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>).<p>- God can ask His servants to do difficult, even painful things for the sake of truth. Our readiness to comply measures our trust (<a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>).<p>- Faithful participation in God&#8217;s plan, however small, weaves into His grand narrative. The unnamed striker had one line in Scripture, yet his quick obedience advanced God&#8217;s judgment and instruction for a nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/20-37.htm">1 Kings 20:37</a> shows a prophet urgently pursuing obedience to God&#8217;s unusual command: he must be wounded so he can deliver a convicting parable to King Ahab. The verse highlights two contrasts&#8212;obedience versus refusal, and painful faithfulness versus comfortable disobedience. Through one man&#8217;s literal strike God readies a message that will expose Ahab&#8217;s sin and affirm that the LORD&#8217;s word is sovereign, precise, and ultimately victorious.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
