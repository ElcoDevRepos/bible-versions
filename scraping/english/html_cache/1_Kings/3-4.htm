The king referred to here is Solomon, who had recently ascended to the throne. This act of going to Gibeon to sacrifice demonstrates Solomon's devotion and desire to seek God's favor at the beginning of his reign. Gibeon was about six miles northwest of Jerusalem, and it was a central place of worship during this period. The tabernacle, which housed the altar of burnt offering, was located there, making it a legitimate place for sacrifices. This act of worship at Gibeon reflects the transitional period in Israel's religious practices before the centralization of worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>for it was the great high place</b><br>High places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with altars and sacred rituals. The term "great high place" indicates that Gibeon was the most prominent of these sites at the time. Before the construction of the temple, high places were common for worship, although they later became associated with idolatry. The use of high places was a holdover from Canaanite practices, but in this context, it was still an acceptable form of worship to Yahweh. The significance of Gibeon as the great high place underscores its importance as a religious center during Solomon's early reign.<p><b>Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there</b><br>The offering of a thousand burnt offerings signifies Solomon's immense dedication and the seriousness with which he approached his relationship with God. Burnt offerings were a form of sacrifice that symbolized atonement and dedication to God, as the entire animal was consumed by fire. This act of offering such a large number of sacrifices demonstrates Solomon's desire to honor God and seek His guidance. It also reflects the wealth and resources available to Solomon as king. This event precedes God's appearance to Solomon in a dream, where He grants Solomon wisdom, indicating that Solomon's worship was pleasing to God and set the stage for his wise and prosperous reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is the newly anointed king of Israel.

Before he asks for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-9</a>), he moves toward God, showing that leadership begins on bended knee.<p>&#8226; Gibeon was about five miles northwest of Jerusalem, where the tabernacle and the bronze altar still stood (2 Chron 1:3-6). Solomon is honoring the established place of sacrifice laid down in the days of Moses (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-44</a>).<p>&#8226; His willingness to travel underscores eagerness; like David who &#8220;longed to build a house for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>), Solomon prioritizes communion with God over political consolidation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it was the great high place</b><p>&#8226; High places were normally condemned (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31-32</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-11</a>), yet Gibeon is called &#8220;the great high place&#8221; because the tabernacle resided there, making it the authorized center of national worship until the temple would rise in Jerusalem (1 Chron 21:29).<p>&#8226; This phrase explains Solomon&#8217;s choice: he is not dabbling in syncretism but following the provision God allowed before a permanent house was built (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Gibeon&#8217;s unique status illustrates God&#8217;s patience and progressive revelation&#8212;He meets His people where they are while moving them toward fuller obedience, culminating in the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on the altar there</b><p>&#8226; A burnt offering signified total consecration&#8212;everything placed on the altar, nothing held back (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). By multiplying that by a thousand, Solomon dramatizes wholehearted surrender.<p>&#8226; Such lavish sacrifice foreshadows the dedication ceremonies later at the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>; 2 Chron 7:5) and recalls David&#8217;s own costly offerings on Araunah&#8217;s threshing floor (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; God responds to wholehearted worship; immediately afterward He appears to Solomon in a dream (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>). The pattern is consistent: Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-17</a>), Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38-39</a>), and the early church (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>) all encounter God in moments of sacrificial devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s trek to Gibeon, Israel&#8217;s &#8220;great high place,&#8221; demonstrates a young king&#8217;s commitment to seek God first, using the very means God had provided. His extravagant thousand-fold burnt offering embodies total dedication, setting the stage for the divine wisdom and favor that follow. The verse calls every believer to approach God promptly, worship Him where He directs, and surrender everything on the altar, confident that wholehearted devotion still invites God&#8217;s gracious response today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Gibeon.</span>--The name itself, signifying "belonging to a hill," indicates its position on the central plateau of Israel, in the land of Benjamin, whence rise several round hills, on one of which the town stood.
