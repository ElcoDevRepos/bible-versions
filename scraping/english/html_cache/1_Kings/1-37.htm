The LORD's presence with David is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, highlighting God's covenantal relationship with him (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). David's successes, military victories, and establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel are attributed to God's guidance and blessing. This sets a precedent for the expectation of divine support for Solomon.<p><b>so may He be with Solomon</b><br>The transition of kingship from David to Solomon is a significant moment in Israel's history. Solomon is chosen by God to succeed David (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5-6</a>), and this prayerful wish reflects the hope that Solomon will enjoy the same divine favor. Solomon's reign is marked by peace and prosperity, and he is known for his wisdom, which he famously requests from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The continuity of God's presence is crucial for the stability and success of the kingdom.<p><b>and make his throne even greater than that of my lord King David.</b><br>This phrase expresses a desire for Solomon's reign to surpass that of David in glory and success. David's reign was foundational, but Solomon's is expected to build upon it, particularly through the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>). The greater throne also alludes to the expansion of Israel's influence and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding the land and blessings (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). This aspiration for a greater throne can also be seen as a type of the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David and whose kingdom is eternal (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The aging king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his significant role in establishing the kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, chosen by David to succeed him as king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose presence and favor are sought for Solomon's reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A key figure in ensuring Solomon's succession, representing God's voice and will.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_the_priest.htm">Zadok the Priest</a></b><br>A priest loyal to David, involved in anointing Solomon as king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_is_essential.htm">God's Presence is Essential</a></b><br>Just as the LORD was with David, His presence is crucial for Solomon's success.

<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>&#8212;&#8220;The Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward,&#8221; a reminder that David&#8217;s kingship was Spirit-empowered from the start.<p>&#8226;

<a href="/deuteronomy/31-8.htm">Deuteronomy 31:8</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD Himself goes before you and will be with you,&#8221; echoes the desire for unbroken guidance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7&#8211;9</a>&#8212;Solomon later prays for wisdom; this blessing anticipates that moment, asking God&#8217;s presence to equip him for what lies ahead.<p>- By invoking God&#8217;s presence, the people acknowledge Solomon&#8217;s need for divine oversight in a complex transition, just as Joshua needed it after Moses (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores continuity: Israel will not be led by a new strategy but by the same unchanging God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And make his throne even greater than that of my lord King David</b><p>- Far from diminishing David, this wish honors him by treating his reign as the benchmark and asking God to surpass even that high standard.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>&#8212;God promised David a son whose kingdom He would establish forever; the blessing aligns with that covenant.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1&#8211;8</a> (a psalm attributed to Solomon) envisions worldwide dominion and justice, matching the hope for an expanded throne.<p>- The request recognizes that God delights in growth and fulfillment of His promises; greater influence for Solomon would mean greater blessing for the nation and a clearer preview of the ultimate Davidic King (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<p>- Practically, a stronger throne would ensure stability, peace, and the flourishing of worship centered on the future temple Solomon would build (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Benaiah&#8217;s blessing compresses Israel&#8217;s history and hope into one sentence: the LORD&#8217;s proven faithfulness to David, the plea for that same presence with Solomon, and the expectation that God will advance His kingdom purposes even further.
