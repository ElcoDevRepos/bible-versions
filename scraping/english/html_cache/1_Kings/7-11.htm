These stones were likely quarried from the region around Jerusalem, known for its high-quality limestone. The use of such materials reflects the importance of the structures being built, as they were meant to be lasting and impressive. In biblical symbolism, stones often represent strength and permanence, qualities attributed to God's eternal nature and His covenant with Israel. The costly stones also highlight the fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for the Lord (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>).<p><b>cut to size</b><br>The precision in cutting the stones to size indicates the advanced craftsmanship and engineering skills present during Solomon's time. This meticulous work ensured that the stones fit perfectly together, contributing to the stability and beauty of the structure. The phrase "cut to size" can also be seen as a metaphor for God's work in shaping His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, where God is described as the potter and His people as the clay. This reflects the idea of divine preparation and purpose.<p><b>and cedar beams</b><br>Cedar wood was highly prized in the ancient Near East for its durability, fragrance, and resistance to decay and insects. The cedar beams used in Solomon's construction projects were imported from Lebanon, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, where Solomon made a treaty with Hiram, king of Tyre, to supply the wood. This trade relationship underscores the political alliances and economic prosperity of Solomon's reign. Cedar is also associated with majesty and beauty in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, where the righteous are compared to the cedars of Lebanon. The use of cedar beams in the temple and palace construction can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the cornerstone and foundation of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), providing strength and support to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace.
