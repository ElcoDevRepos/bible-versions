His reign began around 931 BC, following the division of the kingdom due to Solomon's idolatry and heavy taxation. Jeroboam was initially promised a lasting dynasty by the prophet Ahijah if he obeyed God's commands (<a href="/1_kings/11-38.htm">1 Kings 11:38</a>). However, his reign was characterized by idolatry, as he set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan to prevent the Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This act of apostasy set a precedent for future kings of Israel and led to the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom.<p><b>and he rested with his fathers</b><br>The phrase "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, indicating that Jeroboam died and was buried, likely in a family tomb. This expression reflects the belief in an afterlife and the continuation of one's lineage. It also signifies the end of his earthly rule and the transition of power. Jeroboam's death marked the conclusion of a tumultuous reign that had significant religious and political implications for Israel. Despite his initial promise, his failure to follow God's commands resulted in a legacy of idolatry and division.<p><b>and his son Nadab reigned in his place</b><br>Nadab's succession to the throne indicates the continuation of Jeroboam's dynasty, albeit briefly. Nadab's reign was short-lived, lasting only two years (<a href="/1_kings/15-25.htm">1 Kings 15:25-28</a>). His rule continued in the idolatrous practices of his father, which ultimately led to his assassination by Baasha, who then usurped the throne. This transition highlights the instability and violence that characterized the northern kingdom's leadership. The failure of Jeroboam's line to maintain the throne underscores the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant, as prophesied by Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/14-10.htm">1 Kings 14:10-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

I have suggested elsewhere (Homil. Quart. IV., p. 257) that the "stroke" was not improbably his son's death, which was at once so tragical and such a bitter foretaste of judgment to come.
