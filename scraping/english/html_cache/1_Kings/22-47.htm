The absence of a king in Edom during this period suggests a time of instability or transition. This situation may have been influenced by the political dominance of Israel or Judah, as Edom was often subject to their control. The lack of a king could indicate a weakened state, making Edom vulnerable to external influence or control.<p><b>a deputy served as king.</b><br>The term "deputy" implies a subordinate or representative ruler, possibly appointed by a foreign power, such as Israel or Judah. This arrangement suggests that Edom was under the influence or control of a neighboring kingdom, which is consistent with the historical context of Israel's expansion and dominance during the reigns of kings like David and Solomon. The use of a deputy rather than a native king could reflect a strategy to maintain order and loyalty in a vassal state. This situation is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where foreign powers installed local rulers to govern on their behalf, as seen in the Roman practice during the New Testament era.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.
