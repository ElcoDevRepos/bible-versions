The Phoenicians were renowned for their skills in shipbuilding and trade, which made them valuable allies. The anointing of Solomon as king signifies a divinely sanctioned leadership transition, a common practice in ancient Israel to denote God's choice. This transition from David to Solomon marks a period of peace and prosperity, allowing for the construction of the Temple. The relationship between Israel and Tyre is significant, as it reflects the political and economic alliances of the time. Hiram's awareness of Solomon's anointing indicates the importance of Israel in the region and the respect other nations had for its leadership.<p><b>he sent envoys to Solomon</b><br>Sending envoys was a customary diplomatic practice in the ancient Near East, used to establish or maintain alliances and communicate intentions. This act by Hiram demonstrates his desire to continue the positive relationship established with David. It also reflects the political acumen of Hiram, recognizing the strategic importance of maintaining good relations with Israel under Solomon's rule. The sending of envoys can be seen as an act of respect and acknowledgment of Solomon's new authority, as well as a move to secure mutual benefits, particularly in trade and resources.<p><b>for Hiram had always been a friend of David</b><br>The friendship between Hiram and David is well-documented, with Hiram providing materials and craftsmen for David's building projects, including his palace. This alliance was beneficial for both parties, as it provided Israel with resources and expertise, while Tyre gained a powerful ally. The continuation of this friendship through Solomon suggests a stable and enduring alliance. This relationship can be seen as a type of Christ, where peace and cooperation are established through covenant relationships. The friendship also highlights the theme of God's providence in establishing and maintaining relationships that further His purposes, such as the building of the Temple, which Solomon would undertake with Hiram's assistance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram,_king_of_tyre.htm">Hiram, King of Tyre</a></b><br>Hiram was the ruler of the Phoenician city of Tyre.
