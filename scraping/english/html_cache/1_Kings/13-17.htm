In the Old Testament, the "word of the LORD" often signifies a direct revelation from God, underscoring the seriousness and sacredness of the command. This reflects the prophetic tradition where God's instructions are conveyed to His chosen messengers. The phrase also highlights the importance of obedience to God's word, a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> and <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, where reliance on God's word is paramount.<p><b>&#8216;You must not eat bread or drink water there:</b><br>This command signifies a prohibition against partaking in the hospitality of the place, which in this context is Bethel. Bethel was a center of idolatrous worship under King Jeroboam, who set up golden calves there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The prohibition can be seen as a symbolic act of separation from the idolatry and corruption present in the land. It also serves as a test of the prophet's obedience and faithfulness to God's specific instructions, reminiscent of the Nazarite vow in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, which included abstaining from certain foods and drinks as a sign of dedication to God.<p><b>or return by the way you came.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This instruction to take a different route back can be interpreted as a symbolic act of complete separation from the sinful practices of Bethel. It also serves as a practical measure to avoid any potential influence or temptation to disobey God's command. The directive to not return by the same way may also signify a new beginning or a transformation, akin to the concept of repentance, which involves turning away from sin and not returning to former ways. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live transformed lives (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet from Judah sent by God to deliver a message to King Jeroboam in Bethel.

word of the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The unnamed man of God makes it clear that his directive comes directly from God, not personal preference (<a href="/1_kings/13-9.htm">1 Kings 13:9</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s word is the final authority; the prophet&#8217;s obedience depends on trusting that revealed word, much like Noah following detailed instructions in <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a> or Elijah obeying &#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; to hide by the Brook Cherith in <a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2-5</a>.<p>&#8211; This statement underscores the seriousness of divine command; disobedience is not merely a mistake but rebellion against God Himself (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must not eat bread</b><p>&#8211; Refusing bread in Bethel distances the prophet from Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatrous system (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>).<p>&#8211; God often uses food restrictions to mark separation and holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-16</a>).<p>&#8211; Accepting a meal would signal fellowship and approval; by abstaining, the prophet visibly condemns the false altar (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or drink water there</b><p>&#8211; Even the most basic refreshment is off-limits, highlighting total avoidance of compromise (<a href="/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3-4</a>, Nazarite vow).<p>&#8211; In Scripture, withholding water can signify divine judgment (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) or consecration (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>).<p>&#8211; The command stresses urgency: finish the mission, do not linger, do not be entangled (<a href="/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or return by the way you came</b><p>&#8211; A different route prevents prolonged contact and reinforces the finality of God&#8217;s judgment on the altar (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-12.htm">Matthew 2:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Leaving by another path also protects the prophet from retaliation by Jeroboam (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10-12</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritually, it illustrates repentance&#8212;turning from sin and not circling back (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/13-17.htm">1 Kings 13:17</a> sets out three clear prohibitions&#8212;no bread, no water, no return by the same route&#8212;delivered &#8220;by the word of the LORD.&#8221; Each element reinforces the prophet&#8217;s total separation from Bethel&#8217;s false worship and his exclusive loyalty to God. The verse teaches that when God speaks, His servants must obey completely, avoiding every form of compromise and keeping themselves wholly devoted to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was said to me</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">word to me</span>] <span class="cmt_word">by</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/13-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
