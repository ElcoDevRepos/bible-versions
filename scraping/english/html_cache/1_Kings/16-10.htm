Asa was known for his religious reforms and efforts to rid Judah of idolatry, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11-15</a>. His reign provides a contrast to the instability and idolatry in the northern kingdom of Israel, where this event takes place. The synchronization of the reigns of Judah and Israel's kings is a common biblical method for dating events.<p><b>Zimri went in</b><br>Zimri was a commander of half the chariots of Israel, indicating his significant military position and influence. His actions are a part of the frequent coups and assassinations that characterized the northern kingdom's leadership, reflecting the political instability and moral decline during this period. The phrase suggests a premeditated and bold move, as Zimri took advantage of his position to execute his plan.<p><b>struck Elah down, and killed him</b><br>Elah was the son of Baasha and the king of Israel at the time. His assassination by Zimri is a fulfillment of the prophecy against Baasha's house, as declared by the prophet Jehu in <a href="/1_kings/16.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>. This act of violence underscores the theme of divine retribution and the consequences of idolatry and sin, as Elah's reign was marked by continued idolatry and evil in the sight of the Lord.<p><b>And Zimri reigned in his place</b><br>Zimri's reign was short-lived, lasting only seven days, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/16-15.htm">1 Kings 16:15</a>. His brief rule is a testament to the chaotic and transient nature of leadership in Israel during this era. Zimri's usurpation and subsequent downfall highlight the instability that plagued the northern kingdom, contrasting with the relative stability in Judah under Asa. This event also foreshadows the eventual downfall of the northern kingdom due to its persistent unfaithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zimri.htm">Zimri</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel who conspired against and assassinated King Elah, becoming king himself.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elah.htm">Elah</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was killed by Zimri while he was in a state of drunkenness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>The king of Judah during whose reign these events in Israel took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tirzah.htm">Tirzah</a></b><br>The location where Elah was killed and where Zimri began his short reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, distinct from Judah, where these events occurred.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sinful_ambition.htm">The Consequences of Sinful Ambition</a></b><br>Zimri's actions demonstrate the destructive nature of ambition that is not aligned with God's will.
