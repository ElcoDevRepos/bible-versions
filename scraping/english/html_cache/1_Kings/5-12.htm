This divine wisdom is a key theme in Solomon's reign, enabling him to govern Israel effectively and build the temple. The wisdom given to Solomon is not merely intellectual but encompasses moral and spiritual discernment, reflecting the biblical principle that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Solomon's wisdom is a type of Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<p><b>There was peace between Hiram and Solomon,</b><br>The peace between Hiram, king of Tyre, and Solomon is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern politics. Tyre was a powerful Phoenician city-state known for its skilled craftsmen and valuable resources, particularly cedar wood. The peaceful relations allowed Solomon to acquire materials and labor for the construction of the temple, fulfilling David's vision (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-4.htm">1 Chronicles 22:4</a>). This peace is a reflection of Solomon's wise diplomacy and God's favor, as peace is often seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/29-11.htm">Psalm 29:11</a>).<p><b>and the two of them made a treaty.</b><br>The treaty between Hiram and Solomon is an example of a suzerain-vassal relationship common in the ancient Near East, where a stronger power (Tyre) and a lesser power (Israel) would form a mutually beneficial agreement. This treaty facilitated trade and ensured stability, allowing Solomon to focus on building projects and the administration of his kingdom. The alliance with Hiram also underscores the importance of cooperation and unity, themes echoed in the New Testament's call for peace and unity among believers (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon is known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
