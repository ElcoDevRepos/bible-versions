This feast was part of his self-coronation celebration, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures to solidify claims to the throne. The gathering of guests, including influential figures, was intended to gain support for his kingship. This event parallels Absalom's earlier rebellion against David, highlighting the recurring theme of familial strife and the consequences of ambition outside God's will.<p><b>when they heard the sound of the ram&#8217;s horn</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, was traditionally used in Israel for significant announcements, such as the coronation of a king or the call to worship. Its sound signified a divine or royal proclamation, often associated with God's intervention or the anointing of a new leader. In this context, the horn announced Solomon's anointing as king, orchestrated by Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest, signifying divine approval and the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his lineage.<p><b>&#8220;Why is the city in such a loud uproar?&#8221; asked Joab</b><br>Joab, David's military commander, was a key figure in the political landscape of Israel. His question reflects his surprise and concern over the unexpected commotion in Jerusalem. The uproar was due to the public celebration of Solomon's anointing, which contrasted sharply with Adonijah's private feast. Joab's inquiry indicates his lack of awareness of David's decision to appoint Solomon, highlighting the tension and division within the kingdom. This moment underscores the theme of divine sovereignty, as God's chosen leader, Solomon, is established despite human schemes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The son of King David who attempted to declare himself king without his father's blessing.

Moments earlier &#8220;Zadok the priest took the horn of oil &#8230; and they blew the ram&#8217;s horn, and all the people proclaimed, &#8216;Long live King Solomon!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39-40</a>). The trumpet meant:<p>&#8226; Public confirmation of Solomon&#8217;s anointing, ordered by David himself (<a href="/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-35</a>).<p>&#8226; A legal and spiritual summons, for the shofar announced new kings (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>) and sacred assemblies (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; A reminder that God, not man, authors leadership transitions.

His question reveals:<p>&#8226; Shock: the commotion was greater than anything Adonijah&#8217;s small circle could produce (compare <a href="/exodus/32-17.htm">Exodus 32:17-18</a>, where noise betrayed Israel&#8217;s idolatry).<p>&#8226; Suspicion: Joab understood military signals; a trumpet meant official action he had not authorized.<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing: &#8220;the earth quaked with their noise&#8221; over Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-40.htm">1 Kings 1:40</a>), while Adonijah&#8217;s project began to unravel (vv. 42-53). Like Belshazzar, he realized too late that God had intervened.<p>The uproar was not chaos but unified rejoicing for the rightful king, contrasting with the isolated revelry of the usurper.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/1-41.htm">1 Kings 1:41</a> captures the tipping point between human ambition and divine appointment. A complacent feast, a piercing trumpet, and a startled question reveal how swiftly God overturns self-exaltation and establishes His chosen leader. The verse urges every reader to trust the Lord&#8217;s sovereign timing, reject proud self-promotion, and rejoice when He exalts the one He has anointed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">When Joab heard</span>.--It is one of the many life- like touches of the narrative that it is the old warrior Joab who, amidst the revelry of his companions, notices the sound of the trumpet, and the acclamation following.
