This reflects God's consistent communication with His chosen leaders, as seen with Adam, Noah, and Moses. The explicit nature of the warning underscores the seriousness of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Solomon's wisdom, a gift from God, should have guided him to heed these warnings, yet he failed to do so.<p><b>not to follow other gods</b><br>The command against idolatry is a central tenet of the Mosaic Law, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). Solomon's marriages to foreign women led him to worship their gods, such as Ashtoreth and Milcom, which was a direct violation of God's law. This reflects the broader biblical theme of Israel's struggle with idolatry, which often led to their downfall and exile.<p><b>Solomon did not keep the LORD&#8217;s command</b><br>Solomon's failure to obey God's command marks a turning point in his reign and the history of Israel. Despite his wisdom and the blessings he received, Solomon's heart turned away from God, leading to the division of the kingdom after his death. This disobedience serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and the seduction of worldly influences.

Earlier Scripture had already made the warning unmistakable&#8212;<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a> forbade Israel&#8217;s kings from multiplying wives lest their hearts be led astray, and <a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14</a> commanded, &#8220;Do not follow other gods.&#8221; Solomon heard all this firsthand, so the verse under study reminds us that God&#8217;s cautions were crystal clear. Likewise, <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> urges us, &#8220;We must pay closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not to follow other gods</b><p>The heart of the warning centers on loyalty. The first commandment states, &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). God is &#8220;a jealous God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), intolerant of rivals, because idolatry always wrecks covenant fellowship. Solomon&#8217;s many foreign wives introduced worship of Ashtoreth, Milcom, and Chemosh (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>). Each false deity represented a worldview opposed to the holiness, truth, and mercy of the LORD. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a> attaches severe consequences to such compromise: the &#8220;anger of the LORD will burn against you.&#8221; Paul echoes the principle in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, asking, &#8220;What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Solomon did not keep the LORD&#8217;s command</b><p>The tragedy is stark: wisdom without obedience collapses. Despite unparalleled insight (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>) and abundant blessing, Solomon &#8220;did evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-6.htm">1 Kings 11:6</a>). Disobedience was not accidental; it was willful neglect. Notice the progression:<p>&#8226; Affection&#8212;he &#8220;loved many foreign women&#8221; (11:1)<p>&#8226; Accommodation&#8212;he &#8220;clung to these women in love&#8221; (11:2)<p>&#8226; Apostasy&#8212;&#8220;his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD&#8221; (11:4).<p>God&#8217;s response is swift: the kingdom will be torn apart (11:11-13). <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a> affirms the justice: &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required.&#8221; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> reminds believers to be &#8220;doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/11-10.htm">1 Kings 11:10</a> underscores that clear revelation demands wholehearted obedience. God warned; Solomon ignored. The verse is a sober reminder that spiritual privilege never licenses disobedience.
