The "heavy yoke" symbolizes the burdensome demands placed on the people. Historically, Solomon's reign was marked by prosperity but also by increasing discontent due to these demands. The term "yoke" is often used in the Bible to describe oppression or servitude (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a>). This sets the stage for the division of the kingdom, as the northern tribes express their grievances to Solomon's son, Rehoboam.<p><b>But now you must lighten the burden of your father&#8217;s service</b><br>The people are appealing to Rehoboam to reduce the harsh labor and taxes that characterized Solomon's administration. This request highlights the people's desire for relief and a more compassionate rule. The "service" refers to the forced labor and obligations imposed on them. This plea is a pivotal moment, as it tests Rehoboam's leadership and wisdom. The request for a lighter burden echoes the biblical principle of just and fair leadership, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, where kings are advised to rule with righteousness and humility.<p><b>and the heavy yoke he put on us,</b><br>Reiterating the earlier complaint, this phrase emphasizes the severity of Solomon's policies. The repetition underscores the people's suffering and the critical nature of their appeal. The "heavy yoke" also serves as a metaphor for the spiritual and physical oppression experienced by the Israelites. In a broader biblical context, Jesus Christ later offers rest from such burdens, as seen in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where He invites those who are weary to take His yoke, which is easy and light.<p><b>and we will serve you.</b><br>The people promise loyalty and service to Rehoboam if he agrees to their request. This conditional offer reflects the covenantal relationship between the king and his subjects, where mutual obligations are expected. The willingness to serve under a just ruler is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of righteous leadership. This moment foreshadows the potential for unity and peace if Rehoboam chooses wisely, contrasting with the eventual division of the kingdom due to his failure to heed wise counsel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the king of Israel at this time.

They appeal to the new king&#8217;s freedom to chart a different course (<a href="/2_chronicles/10-4.htm">2 Chronicles 10:4</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s law already set out principles for just rule and limited taxation (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>), so their request aligns with covenant expectations.<p>- Wisdom literature affirms that gentler leadership wins loyalty (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>; 20:28).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the heavy yoke he put on us,</b><p>- The repetition underscores how oppressive Solomon&#8217;s policies felt.

They respectfully urge Rehoboam to reduce those demands, citing covenant norms of just leadership. By repeating &#8220;heavy yoke,&#8221; they emphasize real, tangible oppression and hold out a clear promise: lift the weight, and they will remain faithful subjects. The passage highlights the biblical expectation that authority exists to bless and relieve, not to exploit&#8212;a lesson Rehoboam tragically ignores, fracturing the kingdom in the chapters that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">We</span> <span class= "bld">will serve thee.</span>--It seems evident from the tone of the narrative, and especially from the absence of all resentment on the part of the king on the presentation of these conditions, that they were acting within their right; and whatever Jeroboam's designs may have been, there is no sign of any general predetermination of rebellion. The imposition of the burdens of heavy taxation and forced labour on the people was against old traditions, and even against the practice of Solomon's earlier years. (See <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm" title="Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.">1Kings 4:20</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1Kings 9:20-22</a>.) To demand a removal, or alleviation of these was perfectly compatible with a loyal willingness to "serve" the new king. The demand might naturally be suggested by Jeroboam, who, by his official position, knew well the severity of the burden.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy father made our yoke</span> [see for the literal sense of the word, <a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>, etc.; for its tropical use, <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, etc.] <span class="cmt_word">grievous</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heavy</span>. Was this complaint a just one? It is one which occasions us some surprise, as the reign of Solomon had not only been glorious, but the people had apparently enjoyed the greatest plenty and prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20, 25</a>; cf. 8:66). Bishop Hall, Bahr, and other writers, consequently, who see in the fact that the ten tribes had chosen Jeroboam for their mouthpiece a settled determination on their part to revolt, affirm that their grievances were purely factitious. But we must not forget that, despite the unbroken peace (see Hall, "Contempl." 2:136) and general prosperity and affluence, the people had had one burden at least to bear which is always galling and vexatious, the burden of a conscription. It is by no means certain, though it is constantly assumed, and is not in itself improbable, that the taxes and imposts had been heavy, the passages alleged in support of that view (<a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15, 25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>, LXX.) being quite inconclusive. But while we have no right to speak of the, enormous exactions of the late king" (Stanley), we may be perfectly sure that such an establishment as his (<a href="/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 26</a>) and such undertakings (<a href="/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14, 22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26, 17, 18</a>) would be extremely costly, and that their cost was not altogether defrayed by the presents of subject princes (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; cf. 10:10, 14), the profits of the king's merchants (<a href="/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>), or the imports of the fleet (1 Kings 5:21 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). But the people had certainly had to pay a more odious tribute, that of forced labour, of servile work (<a href="/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>, Hebr.; 5:14 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 4:34<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> is almost always used of a tribute rendered by labour, Gesen.) It is quite true that Solomon was not the first to institute this; that David had exacted it before him (<a href="/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>); that the burden was one with which all subjects of the old-world monarchies, especially in the East, were familiar; and that in this case it had been imposed with peculiar considerateness (<a href="/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>). But it is none the less certain, when we consider the magnitude of Solomon's undertakings, and the number of men necessarily employed in executing them, that it must have involved some hardships and created much dissatisfaction; such results are inevitable in all conscriptions. "Forced labour has been amongst the causes leading to insurrection in many ages and countries. It alienated the people of Rome from the last Tarquin; it helped to bring about the French Revolution; and it was for many years one of the principal grievances of the Russian serfs" (Rawlinson). But we may find instances of its working perhaps as more Eastern, more closely illustrative of the text amongst the Fellahin of Egypt. "According to Pliny, 360,000 men had to work 20 years long at one pyramid" (Bahr). In the construction of the great Mahmoudieh canal, by Mehemet All, over 300,000 labourers were employed. They worked under the lash, and such were the fatigues and hardships of their life that many thousands died in the space of a few months (cf., too, <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> sqq.; Exodus 2:23]: <span class="cmt_word">now therefore make thou the grievous</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">hard, heavy</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">lighten somewhat from</span>," etc.], <span class="cmt_word">and we will serve thee.</span> [Their stipulations seem reasonable enough. Bahr, who says, "We cannot admit the complaint of too hard tribute work to be well founded," and Keil, who maintains that "there cannot have been any well-grounded occasion for complaint," surely forget that both the aged counsellors (ver. 7) and also the writer of this book (vers. 13-15) manifest some degree of sympathy with the complainants.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Your father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
