If our version (as is probable) is correct, the outside measure of the lintel and post was a fifth part of the wall, that is, four cubits, or six feet. Each door, therefore, would be something less than six feet by three. The description of the gilding states with minute accuracy that in overlaying the whole of these doors with gold, gold was "spread," that is, made to cover the carvings in relief (the cherubim of <a href="/1_kings/6-35.htm" title="And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.">1Kings 6:35</a>); in the other doors the gold was fitted, probably beaten into shape, over the carved work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And for the entering of the oracle, he made doors</span> [which hung on golden hinges (<a href="/1_kings/7-50.htm">1 Kings 7:50</a>] <span class="cmt_word">of olive tree</span> [see on ver. 23)], <span class="cmt_word">the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</span> [The meaning of the Hebrew words has been much disputed.

Gesen. himself interprets as A.V.: <span class="accented">crepido cum postibus erat quinta pars, i.e., quintam parietis partem occupabat.</span> The Rabbins: the "entablature with side posts and threshold formed a pentagon." But a pentagonal doorway is without example in Eastern architecture. Thenius: "the strength (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is generally taken as an architectural term = <span class="accented">crepido portae</span>, or entablature) of the posts was a fifth." Rawlinson: "the lintel was one-fifth of wall, and each door post one-fifth of its height;" in which case the doorway would of course be a square of four cubits. But perhaps the rendering of A.V. (with which Keil and Bahr also agree) is more natural. The meaning, consequently, would be that the entrance to the oracle, inclusive of the side posts which helped to form it, occupied one-fifth of the extent of the cedar partition. The entrance to the <span class="accented">house</span> (ver. 33) was one-fourth of the wall of the house.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the entrance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1514;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(pe&#183;&#7791;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6607.htm">Strong's 6607: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, entrance way</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the inner sanctuary,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
