A cubit, an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches, indicates the depth of the opening, suggesting a significant and purposeful design. This depth may symbolize the depth of understanding and wisdom that Solomon, known for his wisdom, sought to impart through the temple's construction. The "crown" at the top could symbolize authority and kingship, reflecting the divine authority of God over Israel.<p><b>with a round opening like the design of a pedestal</b><br>The round opening suggests a sense of completeness and perfection, often associated with divine creation. The pedestal design indicates stability and support, symbolizing the foundational truths of God's covenant with Israel. This design may also reflect the circular motifs found in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where circles often represented eternity and the divine.<p><b>a cubit and a half wide</b><br>The width of the opening, measuring a cubit and a half, emphasizes the balance and proportion in the temple's design. This measurement reflects the careful planning and divine inspiration behind the temple's construction. The use of specific measurements throughout the temple signifies the order and structure that God desires in worship and in the lives of His people.<p><b>And around its opening were engravings</b><br>Engravings were a common decorative element in ancient temples, often depicting scenes of religious significance or symbols of divine presence. These engravings could have included cherubim, palm trees, or other motifs found elsewhere in the temple, symbolizing God's presence and the beauty of His creation. The detailed craftsmanship reflects the importance of glorifying God through art and beauty.<p><b>but the panels of the stands were square, not round</b><br>The contrast between the round opening and the square panels highlights the diversity and complexity of God's creation. Squares often symbolize the earth and humanity, while circles represent the divine. This juxtaposition may illustrate the connection between heaven and earth, a central theme in the temple's purpose as a place where God meets with His people. The square panels also suggest stability and order, reinforcing the idea of God's unchanging nature and His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple and his palace, including the intricate designs described in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman who was brought in to execute the detailed work on the temple and its furnishings, including the stands mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, built by Solomon, which included various furnishings and decorations as described in <a href="/bsb/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stands.htm">The Stands</a></b><br>These were part of the temple furnishings, specifically designed to hold the basins used in the temple rituals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was built, serving as the spiritual and political center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/attention_to_detail_in_worship.htm">Attention to Detail in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed description of the temple furnishings highlights the importance of reverence and care in our worship practices.

Scripture details even the &#8220;small things&#8221; so we see God values order and precision in worship (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>). This literal opening reminds us:<p>&#8226; Every piece had a defined purpose, just as every believer has a God-given role (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Holiness requires provision for cleansing before service (<a href="/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>inside the crown at the top</b><p>The &#8220;crown&#8221; is the decorative rim encircling the stand&#8217;s summit.

By placing the opening &#8220;inside the crown,&#8221; the design hides utilitarian parts within beauty, illustrating how God clothes function with glory&#8212;seen supremely in Christ&#8217;s incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was one cubit deep</b><p>A cubit (about 18 in/45 cm) is a concrete measure, underscoring that Scripture gives real dimensions, not myth. Depth ensured stability so the basin would not tip when filled (compare <a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17&#8211;21</a>). Likewise, spiritual stability comes from measurable obedience (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a round opening like the design of a pedestal</b><p>A round shape disperses weight evenly, a practical engineering choice.

The artistry echoes Eden&#8217;s imagery, reminding worshipers that fellowship with God restores what was lost (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the panels of the stands were square, not round</b><p>Square panels provided structural strength, balancing the round features above.

Keil renders it: "And the mouth of it (the laver) was within the chapiter, and in a cubit above it; and the mouth of it (the chapiter) was round, after the manner of pedestal, a cubit and a half; and upon the mouth was carved work, and the panels of it (the mouth) were square, not round." But the rendering of the word "mouth," now for the laver, now for the chapiter, is arbitrary, and the whole is still obscure. As the circular stand (or chapiter) was half a cubit deep, it looks as if the lower surface of the laver was a cubit above the "mouth." If the laver were emptied by a cock near the bottom, this circular stand may have received the drippings. And as the top of this base would be square on plan, and the stand circular, there would be, of course, spaces left at each corner, which may possibly be the engraved "panels" referred to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the mouth of it</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">his mouth.</span> I incline, with Keil, to think the mouth of the <span class="accented">laver</span> just mentioned (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> masc.) is referred to rather than the <span class="accented">stand</span> (Thenius), which would require a fern. suffix] <span class="cmt_word">within</span> <span class="cmt_word">the chapiter</span> [By this we are, perhaps, to understand a round ornament, resembling the capital of a pillar, which stood in the centre of the dome-shaped covering (see ver. 35) of the stand, and on which the laver rested (so Keil, Bahr).
