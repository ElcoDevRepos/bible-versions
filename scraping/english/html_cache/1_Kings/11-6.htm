This phrase indicates a moral and spiritual failure, highlighting the gravity of his actions. The "evil" refers to idolatry and the influence of his foreign wives, which led him to worship other gods (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-5</a>). In biblical context, doing evil in the sight of the LORD often results in divine judgment, as seen throughout the Old Testament. This phrase underscores the seriousness of disobedience to God, especially for a king who was meant to lead Israel in righteousness.<p><b>unlike his father David,</b><br>David, despite his own sins, is often remembered for his heart that sought after God (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>). David's repentance and his deep relationship with God set a standard for the kings of Israel. This comparison highlights Solomon's failure to maintain the same level of devotion and integrity. David's life, though flawed, was marked by a sincere commitment to God, which Solomon lacked in his later years. This contrast serves as a reminder of the importance of faithfulness and repentance.<p><b>he did not follow the LORD completely.</b><br>Solomon's partial obedience is a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromise. While he initially followed God's statutes, his heart was eventually led astray by his alliances and marriages to foreign women, which were against God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). This incomplete devotion is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God desires wholehearted commitment (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). Solomon's failure to follow the LORD completely resulted in the division of the kingdom after his death, fulfilling the prophecy given to him (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). This serves as a warning of the consequences of divided loyalty and the importance of steadfastness in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.

The verse warns that genuine obedience must be wholehearted, consistent, and sustained.
