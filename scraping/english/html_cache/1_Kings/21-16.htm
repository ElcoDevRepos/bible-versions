This event highlights the moral decline of Ahab's reign, as he allowed Jezebel to manipulate the legal system to achieve their desires. The death of Naboth was a result of false accusations and a mock trial, reflecting the corruption and injustice prevalent in Israel at the time. This phrase also underscores the seriousness of coveting, as Ahab's desire for Naboth's vineyard led to murder, violating the commandments given in <a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13 and 20</a>:17.<p><b>he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite</b><br>Ahab's action of taking possession of the vineyard signifies the fulfillment of his covetous desire, but it also sets the stage for divine judgment. The vineyard, located in Jezreel, was a symbol of Naboth's inheritance and family heritage, which was protected under the Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>). Ahab's disregard for this law demonstrates his lack of respect for God's commandments and the rights of his subjects. This act of seizing the vineyard foreshadows the prophetic judgment pronounced by Elijah in the subsequent verses, where Ahab's dynasty is condemned. The narrative serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the certainty of divine justice, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The king of Israel, known for his wickedness and idolatry, heavily influenced by his wife Jezebel.

The guilt is Jezebel's; the fruit, his own. In the LXX. there is here a curious and striking insertion: "he rent his clothes and put on sackcloth," representing Ahab as struck with momentary horror, and then, after thus salving his conscience, still resolving to carry out his desire for the coveted vineyard. The picture is equally true to nature, especially to such a nature as his. But the insertion has little authority, and is probably a mistaken interpolation from <a href="/1_kings/21-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.">1Kings 21:27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose up</span> [According to the LXX., his first act was to rend his clothes and put on sackcloth.
