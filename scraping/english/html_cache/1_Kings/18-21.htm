This event occurs on Mount Carmel, a significant location for both religious and historical reasons. Elijah's approach signifies a direct challenge to the prevailing idolatry in Israel, where the worship of Baal had become widespread under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel's influence. Elijah's role as a prophet is to call the people back to the covenant with Yahweh, emphasizing the need for decisive action.<p><b>&#8220;How long will you waver between two opinions?</b><br>This question highlights the spiritual indecision and syncretism among the Israelites. The term "waver" suggests a limping or hesitating movement, indicating a lack of commitment. The Israelites were attempting to serve both Yahweh and Baal, which was contrary to the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This indecision is a recurring theme in Israel's history, where the people often struggled with faithfulness to God amidst surrounding pagan influences.<p><b>If the LORD is God, follow Him.</b><br>Elijah presents a clear choice, urging the people to follow Yahweh if they recognize Him as the true God. This echoes the covenantal language found throughout the Old Testament, where God calls His people to exclusive worship and obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The call to "follow" implies a total commitment and lifestyle change, aligning with the Shema's command to love God with all one's heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>But if Baal is God, follow him.&#8221;</b><br>Elijah sets up a direct comparison between Yahweh and Baal, challenging the people to choose whom they will serve. Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, and his worship included various rituals that were abominable to the God of Israel. This statement underscores the futility of serving false gods and the need for discernment in recognizing the true source of life and blessing.<p><b>But the people did not answer a word.</b><br>The silence of the people indicates their spiritual paralysis and fear. This moment of silence can be seen as a reflection of their guilt and confusion, as they are confronted with the truth of their unfaithfulness. It also sets the stage for the dramatic demonstration of God's power that follows, where Elijah calls down fire from heaven to prove Yahweh's supremacy. This silence is reminiscent of other biblical moments where God's people are called to choose whom they will serve, such as Joshua's challenge in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD, Elijah is a central figure in this passage, challenging the Israelites to choose between God and Baal.

His public position reminds Israel that the Lord still speaks even in days of apostasy, like Moses addressing all Israel at the edge of the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>). Elijah&#8217;s lone figure against the many underscores that truth is not measured by majority but by the God who declares it (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How long will you waver between two opinions?</b><p>&#8220;Waver&#8221; pictures Israel limping back and forth, trying to keep one foot in covenant loyalty and the other in Canaanite worship. Joshua had confronted the same duplicity centuries earlier: &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). James later exposes the spiritual instability of being &#8220;double-minded&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6-8</a>). God calls His people to wholehearted devotion, not periodic religious preference (<a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the LORD is God, follow Him</b><p>The issue is settled fact: Yahweh alone created and redeemed Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The logical response is obedience&#8212;&#8220;follow Him,&#8221; literally walk behind His lead (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-4.htm">Deuteronomy 13:4</a>). Jesus echoes the same demand for decisive discipleship: &#8220;My sheep hear My voice&#8230; and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). True faith produces motion toward God, not polite acknowledgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if Baal is God, follow him</b><p>Elijah forces a clear choice. You cannot hedge by honoring both. Baal worship promised rain, fertility, and cultural acceptance, yet Scripture repeatedly reveals idols as &#8220;nothing&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>) and warns against exchanging the living God for useless substitutes (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>). Elijah&#8217;s stark alternative exposes idolatry&#8217;s emptiness&#8212;if Baal truly had divine power, devotion should be total. His silence at Carmel will soon prove him false (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people did not answer a word</b><p>Israel&#8217;s mute response reveals conviction without commitment. Like those who heard Stephen but &#8220;could not withstand the wisdom&#8221; yet still resisted (<a href="/acts/6-10.htm">Acts 6:10</a>), they know the truth but fear social and political fallout. Silence shows undecided hearts that need unmistakable evidence; God will shortly supply fire from heaven (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). Delayed obedience, however, is disobedience (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a> presses every listener to stop straddling the fence. Elijah&#8217;s challenge exposes the folly of divided loyalties and calls for an all-in response to the one true God. If the Lord alone is God&#8212;as the coming fire will confirm&#8212;then wholehearted, practical obedience must follow. Any hesitation is itself a verdict against faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">How long halt ye between two opinions?--</span>In this exclamation is expressed the very motto of Elijah's life. It is that of righteous impatience of the "halting" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, limping to and fro) "between two opinions--at all times more dangerous, because more easy, than open apostasy--which was evidently characteristic of Ahab, and probably of the mass of the people. It might have suited well the accommodating genius of such polytheism as had been brought into Israel since the days of Solomon himself, but was utterly incompatible with the sole absolute claim of the worship of Jehovah. Perhaps Jezebel would have scorned it equally for Baal. Compare the indignant expostulation of Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/20-31.htm" title="For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel?
