The "word of the LORD" signifies a direct message from God, often delivered to His prophets. This underscores the authority and authenticity of the message. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>, it follows the events surrounding Naboth's vineyard, where King Ahab and Queen Jezebel conspired to unjustly seize Naboth's property. The phrase emphasizes God's active involvement in the affairs of Israel, holding its leaders accountable. This divine communication is consistent with other instances in the Bible where God speaks to His prophets, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>.<p><b>came to Elijah the Tishbite,</b><br>Elijah is one of the most prominent prophets in the Old Testament, known for his zealous defense of the worship of Yahweh against the encroaching idolatry promoted by Ahab and Jezebel. The designation "the Tishbite" refers to his origin from Tishbe in Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River. Elijah's role as a prophet is crucial during a time of spiritual decline in Israel. His ministry is marked by miraculous events and confrontations with the royal house, as seen in his challenge to the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18). Elijah's life and ministry foreshadow the coming of John the Baptist, as noted in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>), and he is also seen as a type of Christ in his role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>saying:</b><br>This introduces the specific message that God is about to deliver through Elijah. The use of "saying" indicates that what follows is a direct quotation from God, carrying His authority and intention. In the broader narrative of <a href="/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>, this message is a pronouncement of judgment against Ahab and Jezebel for their actions against Naboth. The prophetic message serves as a reminder of God's justice and His concern for righteousness, themes that are prevalent throughout the Bible. The prophets often served as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope to the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_tishbite.htm">Elijah the Tishbite</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and faithfulness in delivering God's messages, often confronting kings and false prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who communicates His will and judgment through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, King Ahab is a central figure in the surrounding account.
