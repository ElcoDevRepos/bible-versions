The use of bronze is significant, as it was a common material for temple furnishings due to its durability and ability to withstand heat. Bronze was also used in the construction of the altar and the Sea of cast metal, symbolizing strength and judgment. The number ten often represents completeness or divine order in the Bible, suggesting the thoroughness of Solomon's preparations for worship. The stands were likely used to support the basins for washing, emphasizing the importance of purity and cleansing in worship practices.<p><b>each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high</b><br>The dimensions of the stands indicate their substantial size and the precision involved in their construction. A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making each stand approximately six feet long and wide, and four and a half feet high. This size would have made them prominent features in the temple courtyard. The specific measurements reflect the order and symmetry valued in the temple's design, mirroring the order of creation and the universe. The use of precise measurements also underscores the importance of following God's instructions in worship, as seen in the detailed plans given for the Tabernacle and later the Temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the construction of the temple and its furnishings, including the bronze stands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>A skilled craftsman from Tyre, who was brought in by Solomon to oversee the construction of the temple's bronze work.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_solomon.htm">Temple of Solomon</a></b><br>The first temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship for the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_stands.htm">Bronze Stands</a></b><br>Part of the temple furnishings, used to support the basins for washing, symbolizing purification and preparation for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was built, serving as the spiritual and political center of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_skilled_craftsmanship_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Skilled Craftsmanship in Worship</a></b><br>The detailed work of the bronze stands highlights the value of using God-given talents for His glory.

Some of the details of the description are obscure, and it is clear that our translators were very much at fault about them. Generally, however, it appears that each base was a kind of hollow chest, 6 feet square on plan, and 4&#171; feet high, having at the angles pilasters or fillets ("ledges" in <a href="/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>), with panels on each side ("borders" in <a href="/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>), ornamented with "lions, oxen, and cherubims," below which hung festoons of thin metal-work--("certain additions made of thin work," in <a href="/1_kings/7-29.htm" title="And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.">1Kings 7:29</a>). Each base was set on four brazen wheels with brazen axles ("plates" in <a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>) only 27 inches high, and with naves, felloes, and spokes, all cast in brass. On each base was a convex circular stand (<a href="/1_kings/7-35.htm" title="And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.">1Kings 7:35</a>), with a "mouth," or circular opening (apparently "the chapiter" of <a href="/1_kings/7-31.htm" title="And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.">1Kings 7:31</a>), upon which, or over which, the laver stood. This was nine inches high, ornamented with carvings of "cherubims, lions, and palm-trees." From the four corners of the upper surface of the base sprang "undersetters," apparently brackets helping to support the laver, which rested above the "mouth" of the convex stand, and to keep it fast in its place (<a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm" title="And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.">1Kings 7:30</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-34.htm" title="And there were four supports to the four corners of one base: and the supports were of the very base itself.">1Kings 7:34</a>). The laver was 6 feet in diameter, and held 40 baths, or about 360 gallons. The whole stood high, no doubt to bring it nearly on a level with the brazen altar, which was 15 feet high. In form, perhaps, each laver was a smaller copy of the molten sea.
