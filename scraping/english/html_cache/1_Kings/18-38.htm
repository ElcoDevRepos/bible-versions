In the context of <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal to a contest to prove whose deity is real. The fire falling from heaven is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses fire as a sign of His presence and power, such as the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> and the pillar of fire in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>. This event underscores God's supremacy over false gods and His ability to act supernaturally in the natural world.<p><b>and consumed the sacrifice</b><br>The consumption of the sacrifice indicates God's acceptance of Elijah's offering. In the Old Testament, sacrifices were a central part of worship and atonement for sin. The complete consumption of the sacrifice by divine fire symbolizes God's approval and serves as a stark contrast to the failure of Baal's prophets to elicit any response from their god. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was wholly accepted by God as the atonement for humanity's sins.<p><b>the wood</b><br>The wood, used to fuel the altar's fire, is also consumed, emphasizing the totality of God's power. In the sacrificial system, wood was necessary to burn offerings, but here, it is not needed as God Himself provides the fire. This highlights the futility of human efforts without divine intervention and points to God's ability to accomplish His purposes without reliance on human means.<p><b>the stones</b><br>The stones of the altar, typically impervious to fire, being consumed, further demonstrate the miraculous nature of this event. Altars were often constructed of stones, symbolizing permanence and strength. The destruction of the stones signifies that nothing is beyond God's reach or power, reinforcing His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>and the dust</b><br>The dust, representing the earth and the mundane, being consumed, illustrates the thoroughness of God's action. Dust is often associated with mortality and insignificance (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>). Its consumption signifies that God's power extends to the smallest and most insignificant elements, leaving no trace of the altar or the challenge.<p><b>and it licked up the water in the trench</b><br>The water in the trench, poured to make the miracle even more undeniable, is also consumed. This detail highlights the impossibility of the event from a natural perspective, as water would typically extinguish fire. The phrase "licked up" suggests a thorough and complete action, leaving no doubt about the divine origin of the fire. This act serves as a testament to God's ability to overcome natural laws and foreshadows the living water that Jesus offers, which quenches spiritual thirst completely (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who challenged the prophets of Baal to demonstrate the power of the true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal and called upon God to send fire from heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>Pagan prophets who worshiped Baal, a false god, and were challenged by Elijah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God who demonstrated His power by sending fire from heaven.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacrifice.htm">The Sacrifice</a></b><br>The offering prepared by Elijah, which included a bull, wood, stones, and water, all consumed by the fire from the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The event on Mount Carmel demonstrates God's supreme power over all false gods and idols.

God&#8217;s fire reveals authenticity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the stones</b><p>&#8226; Stones normally withstand flame, but the altar collapses under holy fire, demonstrating that no earthly structure, however sturdy, can stand before God unyielded (<a href="/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter calls believers &#8220;living stones&#8221; built into a spiritual house (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).

His holiness consumes every trace of impurity (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This totality foreshadows the final purging of all that is perishable when He ushers in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it licked up the water in the trench</b><p>&#8226; Elijah had drenched the altar to remove any suspicion of trickery (<a href="/1_kings/18-33.htm">1 Kings 18:33-35</a>).
