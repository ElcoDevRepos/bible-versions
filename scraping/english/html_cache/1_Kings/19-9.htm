This geographical setting underscores a place of divine encounter and revelation. Elijah's choice to enter a cave suggests a desire for solitude and reflection, possibly mirroring Moses' own experiences on the mountain. The cave represents a place of refuge and introspection, where Elijah can seek God's presence away from the threats of Jezebel. The act of spending the night indicates a period of waiting and anticipation for divine guidance.<p><b>And the word of the LORD came to him,</b><br>This phrase highlights the direct communication between God and His prophets, a common theme throughout the Old Testament. The "word of the LORD" signifies divine revelation and instruction, emphasizing that God actively engages with His chosen servants. This encounter is reminiscent of other biblical figures who received God's word in times of distress, such as Moses, Samuel, and Jeremiah. The phrase underscores the importance of listening for God's voice, especially in moments of crisis or uncertainty.<p><b>saying, &#8220;What are you doing here, Elijah?&#8221;</b><br>God's question to Elijah is both probing and compassionate, inviting the prophet to reflect on his actions and motivations. This inquiry is not for God's benefit, as He is omniscient, but rather for Elijah's self-examination. The question challenges Elijah to consider his purpose and mission, reminding him of his prophetic calling. It echoes God's interactions with other biblical figures, such as Adam in the Garden of Eden, where God asks questions to prompt introspection and repentance. This moment foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus often uses questions to teach and guide His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who had just experienced a great victory over the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel but is now fleeing for his life from Queen Jezebel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cave.htm">Cave</a></b><br>A physical location where Elijah seeks refuge, symbolizing a place of isolation and introspection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who speaks to Elijah, initiating a divine encounter and prompting Elijah to reflect on his current situation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_horeb.htm">Mount Horeb</a></b><br>Also known as Mount Sinai, this is a significant location in biblical history where Moses received the Ten Commandments.

The LXX. implies this distinctly by inserting in <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm" title="And he said, Go forth, and stand on the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:">1Kings 19:11</a> the word "to-morrow," which is also found in the rather vague and prosaic paraphrase of the passage in Josephus. What Elijah replies in imagination in the vision, he repeats next day in actual words.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - And he came thither unto a cave [Heb. <span class="accented">the</span> cave. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Many commentators identify this with "the cliff of the rock" where Moses was concealed while the Lord "passed by" (<a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>), and the use of the same word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> in ver. 11 certainly favours this view. But is it clear that the clift (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> <span class="accented">fissure</span>) was a <span class="accented">cave?</span> Ewald understands "the cave in which at that time travellers to Sinai commonly rested." It is perhaps worth remembering that a part of the desert, though at some distance from Horeb; boars at this day the name of <span class="accented">Magharah</span>, or cave. But there is a "narrow fret" pointed out by tradition as the abode of Elijah, on the side of Jebol Muss. "There is nothing to confirm, but there is nothing to contradict, the belief that it may have been in that secluded basin, which has long been pointed out as the spot No scene could be more suitable for the vision which follows" (Stanley). There is, however, one formidable difficulty in the way of this identification, viz., that the cave is only just large enough for a man's body, which does not agree with ver. 18], <span class="cmt_word">and lodged</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> means strictly to <span class="accented">pass the night</span>. It is possibly connected radically with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him</span> [Not "in vision as he slept" (Rawlinson). He could not "go forth" in his sleep. That he was to go forth "on the morrow" is equally unlikely see ver. 11, note], <span class="cmt_word">and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> [Many writers, Bahr and Keil among them, will not allow that there is aught of reproof in this question, or that Elijah had in any way erred in his hasty flight. The former asks how it comes to pass that the angel, instead of reproving him, succoured and strengthened him (vers. 6, 7), if he was acting in faithlessness or disobedience. But surely it does not follow that God denies all grace and sustenance to His elect servants even if they do, in a moment of despair, forget or distrust Him. Elijah may have been strengthened for this very journey, Because God would meet with him and teach him the lessons of patience and trust he needed to learn, at the "mount of God" itself. And his answer, especially when contrasted with that of ver. 14 (where see note), certainly betrays, not only irritation and despair, but a "carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the vengeance of the Almighty upon all idolaters" (Keil). The question in itself, it is true, does not necessarily impart censure - it might merely mean, "What wouldst thou learn of me?" But when it is remembered that the prophet had been <span class="accented">sent</span> to every other destination by the "word of the Lord," and that he had left Jezreel without any such word - left it in terror and bitter disappointment and sheer distrust of God - it does look as if the words conveyed a gentle reminder that he had deserted the post of duty, and had no right to be there.
