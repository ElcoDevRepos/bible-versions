The portico, or entrance, was a grand and sacred space, and the pillars were not merely structural but also symbolic. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, pillars often represented stability and strength. These pillars at the temple's entrance signified the enduring covenant between God and Israel. The temple itself was a fulfillment of God's promise to David that his son would build a house for His name (<a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a>).<p><b>The pillar to the south he named Jachin,</b><br>The name "Jachin" means "He will establish" or "He establishes." This name reflects the divine promise of stability and establishment, likely referring to God's establishment of the Davidic line and the kingdom of Israel. The positioning of Jachin on the south side may symbolize the direction of blessing and favor, as the south was often associated with warmth and prosperity in biblical literature.<p><b>and the pillar to the north he named Boaz.</b><br>"Boaz" means "In Him is strength" or "By His strength." This name emphasizes the strength and power of God, which undergirds the temple and the nation of Israel. The north side, often seen as a place of challenge or threat in biblical texts, being associated with strength, suggests God's protection and might against adversaries. The names Jachin and Boaz together encapsulate the themes of divine establishment and strength, pointing to God's sovereign role in the life of Israel. These pillars can also be seen as types of Christ, who is both the foundation and strength of the Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel who commissioned the building of the temple, a central figure in the account of 1 Kings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram_of_tyre.htm">Hiram of Tyre</a></b><br>The skilled craftsman who was responsible for much of the temple's construction, including the pillars.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the Israelites worshiped God, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jachin.htm">Jachin</a></b><br>The name of the southern pillar, meaning "He will establish," signifying stability and God's promise to establish His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>The name of the northern pillar, meaning "In Him is strength," representing the strength and support found in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_pillars.htm">Symbolism of the Pillars</a></b><br>The names Jachin and Boaz remind us of God's promises to establish and strengthen His people.
