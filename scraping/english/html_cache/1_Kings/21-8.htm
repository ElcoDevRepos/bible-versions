Writing letters in Ahab's name indicates a usurpation of royal authority, reflecting the corrupt nature of her character. This act of deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals misuse authority for personal gain, such as the deceit of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>. Jezebel's actions foreshadow the eventual downfall of Ahab's dynasty, as prophesied by Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>.<p><b>sealed them with his seal</b><br>The use of Ahab's seal signifies the authenticity and authority of the letters, as seals were used in the ancient Near East to validate documents. This practice is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>, where the king's seal is used to confirm decrees. The seal represents the king's power, and Jezebel's misuse of it highlights the moral decay within the Israelite monarchy. This act of sealing also prefigures the sealing of believers by the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, contrasting divine authority with human corruption.<p><b>and sent them to the elders and nobles</b><br>The elders and nobles were local leaders responsible for maintaining justice and order within their communities. By sending the letters to these figures, Jezebel exploits the societal structure to achieve her ends. This manipulation of justice is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, where leaders are criticized for acquitting the guilty for a bribe. The involvement of the elders and nobles in Jezebel's scheme underscores the pervasive corruption in Israel, setting the stage for divine judgment.<p><b>who lived with Naboth in his city</b><br>Naboth's city is identified as Jezreel, a significant location in Israel's history. Jezreel was a royal city and the site of many pivotal events, including the future downfall of Jezebel herself (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30-37</a>). The mention of Naboth's city emphasizes the personal nature of Jezebel's plot, as it directly impacts Naboth's community and heritage. This local context highlights the violation of God's law regarding land inheritance, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>, where land was to remain within the family. Naboth's refusal to sell his vineyard is an act of obedience to God's command, contrasting with Jezebel's blatant disregard for divine law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and manipulation.

The sealing (as the modern sense of "signature" implies) was the pledge of authenticity and authority. (See <a href="/genesis/38-18.htm" title="And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.">Genesis 38:18</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-38.htm" title="And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal to it.">Nehemiah 9:38</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a>; <a href="/esther/3-10.htm" title="And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.">Esther 3:10</a>; <a href="/esther/3-12.htm" title="Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.">Esther 3:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>, &c.) The use of the seal--ordinarily worn or carried on the person--implies Ahab's knowledge that something is being done in his name, into which he takes care not to inquire. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So she wrote letters</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">writings</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal</span> [The use of the seal, for the purpose of authentication, is of great antiquity.

Their use in the age of the patriarchs is attested by <a href="/genesis/38-15.htm">Genesis 38:15</a> and Genesis 41:42; their importance is proved by the text, by <a href="/esther/3-10.htm">Esther 3:10</a>; <a href="/esther/8-2.htm">Esther 8:2, 8, 10</a> (cf.
