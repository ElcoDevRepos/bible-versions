These locations were typically chosen for their height, which was believed to bring worshippers closer to the divine. In the context of <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>, the construction of high places indicates a departure from the centralized worship in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>. This act of building high places reflects the Israelites' disobedience and syncretism, as they adopted pagan practices contrary to God's commands.<p><b>sacred pillars</b><br>Sacred pillars, or standing stones, were often erected as memorials or objects of worship. In the ancient Near East, these pillars were associated with Canaanite religious practices and were often dedicated to deities. The use of sacred pillars by the Israelites signifies their assimilation of pagan customs, which was explicitly forbidden in passages like <a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-22.htm">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>. These pillars were a physical representation of idolatry and a violation of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<p><b>and Asherah poles</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, often considered a consort of Baal. The presence of Asherah poles among the Israelites indicates a blending of Canaanite fertility cults with the worship of Yahweh. This syncretism was condemned in the Law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a> and <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to destroy such objects. The poles were a direct affront to the exclusive worship of Yahweh and contributed to the spiritual decline of the nation.<p><b>on every high hill</b><br>The phrase "on every high hill" emphasizes the widespread nature of idolatrous practices among the Israelites. High hills were commonly chosen for worship due to their perceived proximity to the divine realm. This widespread idolatry reflects the pervasive influence of surrounding pagan cultures and the failure of Israel's leaders to uphold the covenant. The repetition of this phrase in prophetic literature, such as <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>, underscores the persistent nature of this sin throughout Israel's history.<p><b>and under every green tree</b><br>The mention of "every green tree" highlights the use of natural settings for idolatrous worship. Green trees, often associated with fertility and life, were used as sites for pagan rituals and ceremonies. This practice is condemned in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>, where the Israelites are warned against adopting the customs of the nations they were to dispossess. The use of green trees for worship signifies a departure from the prescribed worship of Yahweh and a return to nature-based paganism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and king of Judah during this period.

The verse serves as a stark warning: self-made worship, no matter how attractive or convenient, always leads God&#8217;s people away from Him and provokes His righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">High places, and images, and groves.</span>--On the "high places," see <a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm" title="Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.">1Kings 3:2</a>, and Note there. The "images" of this passage seem undoubtedly to have been stone pillars, as the "groves" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the asherahs) were wooden stumps of trees (possibly in both cases surmounted by some rude representation of the deity worshipped). The first mention of such a pillar is in <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm" title="And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.">Genesis 35:14</a>, there applied to the stone which Jacob raises and anoints, in order to mark the scene of the vision at Bethel; next, we find repeated commands to destroy them (with the asherahs also) as erected by the Canaanites (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm" title="You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-13.htm" title="But you shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm" title="And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>), and to suffer neither near the altar of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>). Like the high places, it seems plain that both might be either unauthorised emblems of God's presence or images of false gods; and, indeed, the stone pillar appears in some cases to be associated with the worship of Baal, as the Asherah with that of Ashtoreth. In this passage, from the strength of the language used, and from the notice in <a href="/1_kings/14-24.htm" title="And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.">1Kings 14:24</a>, it seems that the grosser idolatry is referred to. It was practised "on every high hill, and every shady tree"--such trees as were notable for size and shade in the bareness of the hills of Palestine.<span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they also</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they as well as the ten tribes] <span class="cmt_word">built them high places</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, houses of high places.

These were, no doubt, originally memorial pillars or stones, erected to commemorate some Divine manifestation, and with no thought of idolatry (see <a href="/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14, 20</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>). But the Canaanites erected pillars, which were also statues or images, to their god, Baal.

The gradual transition of the memorial pillar into the Baal statue <span class="cmt_word">is</span> hinted at in <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a>.
