This long reign suggests a time of consolidation and reform, as Asa is noted for his efforts to rid Judah of idolatry and restore the worship of Yahweh. Jerusalem, the capital city, was the political and spiritual center of Judah, housing the Temple built by Solomon. Asa's reign in Jerusalem underscores the city's significance as the heart of Judah's religious life. The duration of his reign is significant when compared to the often shorter and more tumultuous reigns of kings in the northern kingdom of Israel, highlighting a contrast between the two kingdoms during this period.<p><b>His grandmother&#8217;s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.</b><br>Maacah, Asa's grandmother, is a notable figure in the royal lineage. She was the wife of Rehoboam and the mother of Abijah, Asa's father. Her mention here emphasizes the dynastic continuity and the influence of royal women in the Davidic line. Maacah's name is associated with idolatry, as she is known for having made an Asherah pole, which Asa later removed as part of his religious reforms. The reference to her father, Abishalom, connects her to the broader narrative of the Davidic dynasty, as Abishalom is often identified with Absalom, the son of David. This connection highlights the complex interplay of familial relationships and political power in the history of Judah. The mention of Maacah serves as a reminder of the challenges Asa faced in purging idolatry from his kingdom, even within his own family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asa.htm">Asa</a></b><br>Asa was the king of Judah who reigned for forty-one years.
