His journey to Shechem is significant as it marks the beginning of his reign. Shechem holds historical importance as a city of refuge and a place where significant covenantal events occurred, such as the renewal of the covenant under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). It is located in the hill country of Ephraim, a central location in Israel, which made it a strategic choice for a gathering of the tribes. Rehoboam's decision to go to Shechem rather than remain in Jerusalem, the established capital, suggests an attempt to gain the favor of the northern tribes, who may have felt marginalized under Solomon's rule.<p><b>for all Israel had gone there</b><br>The phrase "all Israel" indicates the gathering of representatives from the twelve tribes, highlighting the unity of the nation at this point. This assembly was likely a formal occasion, reminiscent of earlier tribal gatherings for significant national decisions. The presence of "all Israel" underscores the importance of the event, as the tribes were coming together to affirm Rehoboam's kingship. This gathering also reflects the political tension and the potential for division, as the northern tribes had grievances against Solomon's administration, particularly regarding forced labor and heavy taxation.<p><b>to make him king</b><br>The act of making Rehoboam king was not merely ceremonial; it involved the acceptance and recognition of his authority by the tribes. This was a customary practice in ancient Israel, where the people played a role in affirming their leader, as seen in the anointing of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the impending division of the kingdom, as the subsequent verses reveal the dissatisfaction of the northern tribes with Rehoboam's response to their demands. This division fulfills the prophecy given to Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>), indicating that the kingdom would be torn from Solomon's line due to his idolatry. The event at Shechem thus becomes a pivotal moment in Israel's history, leading to the establishment of the separate kingdoms of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rehoboam.htm">Rehoboam</a></b><br>The son of Solomon and the grandson of David, Rehoboam is the central figure in this passage.

The northern tribes once crowned Abimelech here (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By traveling to Shechem, Rehoboam meets Israel on their own ground rather than summoning them to the royal city, a gesture that could have fostered unity (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The city&#8217;s associations remind readers that every king stands under God&#8217;s longstanding covenant dealings with His people (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for all Israel had gone there</b><p>&#8226;

Rehoboam king, yet he must rule under God&#8217;s authority, not popular demand (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This coronation scene will become the hinge on which the kingdom splits, fulfilling God&#8217;s earlier word to Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between human intention (&#8220;to make him king&#8221;) and divine sovereignty prepares us for the outcome; God&#8217;s purposes stand even when leaders falter (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1</a> captures a pivotal moment: Solomon&#8217;s son journeys to a covenant-saturated city where the united tribes gather to endorse him.

What begins in national unity at Shechem will soon test Rehoboam&#8217;s heart, proving that every throne is secure only when anchored to God&#8217;s wisdom and covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">All Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</span>--In the case of David, we find that, when he was made king over Israel, "he made a league" with the elders of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2Samuel 5:3</a>), apparently implying a less absolute royalty than that to which he had been anointed, without conditions, over the house of Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm" title="And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.">2Samuel 2:4</a>); and in his restoration after the death of Absalom, there appears to be some recognition of a right of distinct action on the part of the men of Israel in relation to the kingdom (<a href="/context/2_samuel/19-9.htm" title="And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.">2Samuel 19:9-10</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/19-41.htm" title="And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?">2Samuel 19:41-43</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1-2</a>). Even in the coronation of Solomon, we find distinction made between royalty "over all Israel and over Judah." (See <a href="/1_kings/1-35.htm" title="Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.">1Kings 1:35</a>; and comp. <a href="/1_kings/4-1.htm" title="So king Solomon was king over all Israel.">1Kings 4:1</a>.) Accordingly, Rehoboam seems to succeed without question to the throne of Judah, but to need to be "made king" by the rest of Israel, with apparently some right on their part to require conditions before acceptance. It is significant, however, that this ceremonial is fixed, not at Jerusalem, but at Shechem, the chief city of Ephraim, of ancient dignity, even from patriarchal times, as of singular beauty and fertility of position, which became, as a matter of course, the capital of the northern kingdom after the disruption. Perhaps, in this arrangement, which seems to have had no precedent, there was some omen of revolution. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rehoboam</span> [see on 1 Kings 11:26, and compare the name <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.
