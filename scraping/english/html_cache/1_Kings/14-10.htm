This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and was seen as a grave sin against God. Jeroboam's actions were motivated by political expediency rather than faithfulness to God, as he feared losing his kingdom if the people went to Jerusalem to worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-27</a>).<p><b>behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam</b><br>The "disaster" is a divine judgment pronounced by the prophet Ahijah. This judgment is a fulfillment of the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience to God's commandments. The "house of Jeroboam" refers to his dynasty, which God had initially promised to establish if Jeroboam remained faithful (<a href="/1_kings/11-38.htm">1 Kings 11:38</a>). However, due to his unfaithfulness, his house is now subject to destruction.<p><b>I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both slave and free, in Israel</b><br>The phrase "cut off" indicates a complete eradication of Jeroboam's male descendants, a common form of judgment in the ancient Near East to ensure the end of a dynasty. The inclusion of "both slave and free" emphasizes the totality of this judgment, leaving no one to carry on Jeroboam's lineage. This mirrors the judgment against the house of Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-33</a>) and foreshadows the eventual downfall of other unfaithful dynasties in Israel.<p><b>I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns up dung until it is gone!</b><br>The imagery of burning dung signifies utter destruction and disgrace. Dung, considered unclean, was disposed of by burning, symbolizing the complete removal of something detestable. This metaphor highlights the severity of God's judgment against Jeroboam's house, reflecting the seriousness of leading Israel into idolatry. The destruction of Jeroboam's house serves as a warning to future leaders about the consequences of turning away from God. This judgment is later fulfilled when Baasha kills Nadab, Jeroboam's son, and destroys his entire family (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The words following have in the original no conjunction <span class= "ital">and</span> between them. They are in antithesis to each other, signifying in some form two opposite divisions of males. The literal sense seems to be "him who is shut up, or bound, and him who is left loose;" and this phrase has been variously interpreted as "the bond and the free," "the married and the unmarried," "the child" who keeps at home, "and the man" who goes abroad. Perhaps the last of these best suits the context; it is like "the old and young" of <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>, <a href="/esther/3-13.htm" title="And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.">Esther 3:13</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm" title="Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.">Ezekiel 9:6</a>, &c.<p><span class= "bld">As a man taketh away dung.</span>--The same contemptuous tone runs on to the end of the verse. The house of Jeroboam is the filth which pollutes the sacred band of Israel; to its last relics it is to be swept away by the besom of destruction. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/9-37.htm" title="And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.">2Kings 9:37</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-10.htm" title="Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.">Psalm 83:10</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house</span> [The punishment fell on the house (<a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>), not, however, to the exclusion of the prime offender (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-20.htm">2 Chronicles 13:20</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>).

Some, consequently, have been led to suppose that the reference is to the dog, but animals would hardly share in the destruction of the royal house. Gesenius is probably right when he interprets it of <span class="accented">boys</span>. Thus understood, it lends additional meaning to the passages where it occurs.
