Adonijah, fearing for his life after his failed attempt to usurp the throne, clung to the horns of the altar, a practice seen in <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a> as a plea for mercy. Solomon's decision to summon Adonijah from the altar demonstrates his initial willingness to show clemency, reflecting the wisdom and discernment for which Solomon is renowned. This act also underscores the transition of power and the establishment of Solomon's authority as king, fulfilling the promise made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a>.<p><b>and he came and bowed down before King Solomon</b><br>Adonijah's act of bowing signifies submission and acknowledgment of Solomon's rightful kingship. In the cultural context of the time, bowing was a gesture of respect and recognition of authority. This moment is pivotal as it marks Adonijah's acceptance of Solomon's rule, aligning with the biblical principle of submission to God-ordained leadership, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>. The act of bowing also prefigures the ultimate submission of all to Christ, the King of Kings, as prophesied in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>.<p><b>who said to him, &#8220;Go to your home.&#8221;</b><br>Solomon's directive for Adonijah to "Go to your home" is an act of mercy, allowing him to live despite his previous rebellion. This decision reflects Solomon's wisdom and restraint, qualities that are central to his reign and are highlighted in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>. By sending Adonijah home, Solomon avoids immediate bloodshed and potential unrest, maintaining peace in the kingdom. This act of mercy can be seen as a type of Christ's forgiveness and grace, offering redemption and a chance for repentance, as illustrated in <a href="/john/8-11.htm">John 8:11</a>.
