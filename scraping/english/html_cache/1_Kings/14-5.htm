Ahijah was a prophet from Shiloh, known for previously delivering God's message to Jeroboam about becoming king over Israel (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). This highlights the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's word. The phrase also underscores God's omniscience and His involvement in the affairs of Israel.<p><b>Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming</b><br>Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. His wife remains unnamed, which is not uncommon in biblical narratives, focusing instead on her role and actions. Her coming to Ahijah signifies a desperate attempt to seek divine intervention for her son, reflecting the cultural practice of seeking prophets for guidance and healing. This also illustrates the personal impact of Jeroboam's political and religious decisions on his family.<p><b>to ask you about her son, for he is ill</b><br>The illness of Jeroboam's son, Abijah, serves as a catalyst for the narrative. In ancient Israel, illness was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or a test of faith. This context suggests that Jeroboam's household is experiencing the consequences of his idolatry and disobedience to God (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). The request for Ahijah's insight indicates a belief in the power of prophetic intercession and the hope for healing or understanding of God's will.<p><b>You are to say such and such to her</b><br>This phrase implies that God has given Ahijah specific instructions on what to communicate. It highlights the prophet's role in delivering God's predetermined message, which often included both judgment and hope. The phrase suggests that the message is not open to alteration, emphasizing the authority and finality of God's word. This reflects the biblical theme of prophecy as a revelation of God's sovereign plan.<p><b>because when she arrives, she will be disguised</b><br>The disguise of Jeroboam's wife indicates an attempt to conceal her identity, possibly due to fear of political repercussions or shame. This act of deception contrasts with the transparency expected in seeking God's truth. It also underscores God's omniscience, as He reveals her intentions to Ahijah beforehand. The use of disguise can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual state of Israel under Jeroboam's rule, where true worship was masked by idolatry. This theme of hidden motives and divine revelation is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the story of Saul and the witch of Endor (<a href="/1_samuel/28-8.htm">1 Samuel 28:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who communicates His will and knowledge to His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahijah.htm">Ahijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who previously foretold Jeroboam's rise to power and now receives a message from God regarding Jeroboam's wife.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam's_wife.htm">Jeroboam's Wife</a></b><br>The unnamed wife of King Jeroboam, who seeks Ahijah's counsel about her sick son while in disguise.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for leading Israel into idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>The sick child of Jeroboam and his wife, whose illness prompts the visit to Ahijah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows all things, including the intentions and disguises of our hearts.
