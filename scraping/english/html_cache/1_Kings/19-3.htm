This shift highlights the human vulnerability even in great prophets. Elijah's fear was triggered by Jezebel's threat (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>), showing the real danger he faced. His flight reflects a natural human response to life-threatening situations, emphasizing the reality of spiritual warfare and the need for divine strength. Elijah's experience can be compared to other biblical figures who faced fear, such as David fleeing from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>) and Jesus in Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-39</a>), illustrating the theme of seeking God's will amidst fear.<p><b>When he came to Beersheba in Judah,</b><br>Beersheba, located in the southern part of Judah, was a significant biblical site, often marking the southern boundary of Israel (<a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>). It was a place of refuge and covenant, as seen in the lives of Abraham and Isaac. Elijah's journey to Beersheba indicates a strategic retreat to a place of safety, as it was outside the jurisdiction of Ahab and Jezebel, who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel. This move underscores the importance of seeking physical and spiritual refuge in times of distress, akin to the psalmist's cry for God's protection (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>he left his servant there,</b><br>Leaving his servant in Beersheba suggests Elijah's desire for solitude, possibly to reflect and seek God's guidance. This action mirrors moments in Scripture where leaders sought isolation to commune with God, such as Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12-18</a>) and Jesus withdrawing to pray (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). It also indicates Elijah's deep despair, as he may have felt his mission was over, paralleling the loneliness expressed by other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>). Elijah's decision to leave his servant behind highlights the personal nature of his struggle and the need for divine intervention in moments of profound crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who had just experienced a great victory over the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel.

Yet when Jezebel threatened his life (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>), fear gripped him.<p>&#8226; Scripture never hides human weakness; even &#8220;a man with a nature like ours&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>) can stagger after great triumph.<p>&#8226; Fear here is not mere anxiety but an urgent, bodily response&#8212;like David&#8217;s cry, &#8220;When I am afraid, I will trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).

The issue is not the act of escaping but the heart seeking refuge apart from God&#8217;s voice.<p>&#8226; Ironically, the prophet who outran Ahab&#8217;s chariot (<a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>) now flees in weariness. Like Jonah later (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>), Elijah&#8217;s steps reveal the struggle between divine calling and human frailty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he came to Beersheba in Judah</b><p>&#8226; Beersheba marks the southern border of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-28.htm">Joshua 15:28</a>). By crossing from Israel into Judah, Elijah leaves Jezebel&#8217;s immediate reach, though not God&#8217;s.<p>&#8226; Beersheba is a place of covenant history: Abraham called on &#8220;the Eternal God&#8221; there (<a href="/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>). Elijah unconsciously retraces covenant paths, even while feeling abandoned.<p>&#8226; This geography underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over every territory and season (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>). Even a desperate detour rests within the map of God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he left his servant there</b><p>&#8226; Releasing his attendant suggests Elijah&#8217;s intent to journey alone into the wilderness&#8212;perhaps resigning his prophetic office.<p>&#8226; Moses once distanced himself from the camp in similar despair (<a href="/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14&#8211;15</a>). Isolation often signals discouragement, yet God meets His servants in solitary places (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>).<p>&#8226; By leaving the servant, Elijah keeps another from sharing his perceived failure. In God&#8217;s economy, however, our weakness becomes the stage for divine strength (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3</a> records a real moment of fear, flight, and fatigue in Elijah&#8217;s life. The prophet who had just witnessed spectacular victory succumbs to terror, illustrating that faith does not erase human emotion. His journey to Beersheba and dismissal of his servant reveal a heart retreating from calling, yet every mile is bordered by God&#8217;s covenant care. The verse reminds believers that moments of panic never nullify God&#8217;s purposes; He pursues His weary children, ready to renew and recommission them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">He arose, and went for his life.</span>--The sudden reaction of disappointment and despondency, strange as it seems to superficial observation, is eminently characteristic of an impulsive and vehement nature. His blow had been struck, as he thought, triumphantly. Now the power of cool unrelenting antagonism makes itself felt, unshaken and only embittered by all that had passed.

The note that "it belonged to Judah" is, perhaps, significant. Judah was now in half-dependent alliance with Israel; even under Jehoshaphat, Elijah might not be safe there, though his servant--traditionally the son of the widow of Zarephath--might stay without danger. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he saw that</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and he saw and arose</span>, etc. But the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">timuit</span>, and it is to be observed that this meaning, "<span class="accented">and he feared</span>," can be extracted from this word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> without any change of radicals, for the full form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is occasionally abbreviated into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>; see <a href="/1_samuel/18-12.htm">1 Samuel 18:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-28.htm">2 Kings 17:28</a>. A few MSS. have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> and it certainly suits the context better. Bahr, who interprets, "he saw how matters stood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that she meant him to flee, is not justified in asserting that this expression would require an accusative of the person feared. (See, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="/genesis/3-10.htm">Genesis 3:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>.) Both he and Keil furthermore object to this interpretation that it is contrary to actual fact, neither of them being willing to allow that Elijah was afraid. Bahr says it is inconceivable that the man who had that day faced alone king and priests and the entire people should have become all at once afraid of a bad woman, and he explains Elijah's flight as caused by the discovery that he could not carryon his work of reformation, and by the absence of any intimation (like that of <a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>) that he was to stay and hazard his life. But apart from the fact that we are distinctly told that he "went <span class="accented">for his life"</span> (cf. vers. 4, 10), and that his flight seems to have been instant and hurried, history tells of many great souls, hardly less brave than Elijah's, which have succumbed to a sudden panic. Anyhow, it is evident that for the moment Elijah had lost faith in God, otherwise he would certainly have waited for the "word of the Lord," which had hitherto invariably guided his movements (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2, 8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>). No doubt other emotions besides that of fear were struggling in his breast, and prominent among these was the feeling of profound disappointment and mortification. It is clear that he had hoped that the "day of Carmel" would turn the heart of the entire nation back again (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37</a>), and the great shout of ver. 39, and the subsequent execution, at his command, of the men who had deceived and depraved the people, might well justify the most sanguine expectations. We can readily imagine, consequently, how, especially after the excitement and fatigues of that day, the threatening and defiant message of the queen would seem the death blow of his hopes, and how, utterly dispirited and broken down, he lost all trust, all faith, and, while fleeing for his life, "requested for himself that he might die" (ver. 4)], <span class="cmt_word">he arose, and went for his life</span> [Keil is compelled, by his refusal to allow that Elijah was actuated by fear, to render these words, "went to commit his soul to God in the solitude of the desert."

The southern boundary of Palestine (<a href="/joshua/15-28.htm">Joshua 15:28</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>, etc.), allotted to the tribe of Simeon (<a href="/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2</a>), which tribe, we gather from this passage (see also <a href="/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a>), was now absorbed in the southern kingdom. (See note on ch. 11:31.) Wordsworth suggests that "perhaps he resorted to Beer-sheba in order to strengthen his faith with the recollection of the patriarchs who had dwelt there," etc. But if that had been his object, a journey to the place was hardly necessary, and it is clear that he only passed through it on his way to Mount Sinai. "Beer-sheba was about 95 miles from Jezreel" - Rawlinson, who adds that Elijah cannot have reached it till the close of the second day. But we must remember that his pace would be regulated by the powers of his servant, probably a mere lad (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), so that it is hardly likely he could travel day and night without stopping to rest], which belongeth to Judah [It is part of Keil's argument in proof that Elijah did not flee from fear of Jezebel, that, had such been the case, he would have remained in the kingdom of Judah, where he would have enjoyed the protection of Jehoshaphat. But it is by no means certain that this prince, considering his close alliance with Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>; cf. 18:10; <a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>), would have sheltered the prophet. Indeed, it is remarkable, as Blunt has well pointed out (Coincid. pp. 183, 184), that the prophet <span class="accented">never</span> took refuge in the southern kingdom. At one time he found a sanctuary beyond the Jordan; at another in the kingdom of Tyre, but never in the realm of Jehoshaphat. When he does come in haste to Beer-sheba, "it is after a manner which bespeaks his reluctance to set foot within that territory, even more than if he had evaded it altogether." The reason partly was, no doubt, as Wordsworth says, that his mission was to idolatrous Israel. Judah had both priests and prophets of its own], <span class="cmt_word">and left his servant</span> [There is no warrant for the assertion (Stanley) that "one only of that vast assembly remained faithful to him, the Zidonian boy of Zarephath." The identity of this boy with the servant is by no means certain; nor is the defection of the people at all proven] <span class="cmt_word">there</span>. [Probably because he wished to be alone with God; possibly because the boy was then too exhausted to go further, and there was no reason why he should be subjected to the uncertainties and privations of desert life; hardly for the security of both (Blunt). It is perhaps implied, however, that the kingdom of Judah, though not a safe abode for him, would be for his servant. When we remember that this servant never rejoined him, but that presently Elisha took his place, we can scarcely help wondering whether he was afraid to accompany Elijah any longer (cf. <a href="/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a>).] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Elijah was afraid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
