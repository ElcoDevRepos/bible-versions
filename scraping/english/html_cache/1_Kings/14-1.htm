It follows the account of Jeroboam's reign over the northern kingdom of Israel, which was marked by idolatry and disobedience to God. The timing is significant as it occurs during a period of divine judgment against Jeroboam's house, as prophesied by Ahijah the prophet (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-39</a>).<p><b>Abijah son of Jeroboam</b><br>Abijah, whose name means "Yahweh is my father," is the son of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy. Jeroboam's reign was characterized by the establishment of alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan, leading Israel into sin (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). Abijah's mention here highlights the personal impact of Jeroboam's actions on his family, as the consequences of his idolatry extend to his offspring.<p><b>became ill</b><br>The illness of Abijah serves as a catalyst for the unfolding events in the chapter. In the ancient Near Eastern context, illness was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme where physical ailments sometimes reflect spiritual realities or divine intervention (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/12-15.htm">2 Samuel 12:15-18</a>). The illness prompts Jeroboam to seek a prophetic word, indicating a recognition of the need for divine insight, despite his previous rejection of God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abijah.htm">Abijah</a></b><br>The son of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

Yet Jeroboam &#8220;did not turn from his evil way&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals that Abijah&#8217;s sickness is not random; it is tied to the spiritual climate of the kingdom at that very time.

It fixes the timing (&#8220;At that time&#8221;), spotlights a young prince with a tender heart (&#8220;Abijah&#8221;), links him to a wayward heritage (&#8220;son of Jeroboam&#8221;), and introduces a divinely purposed crisis (&#8220;became ill&#8221;). Together these details set up the chapter&#8217;s unfolding judgment and mercy, reminding readers that God rules history, sees individuals, weighs family legacies, and even employs sickness to call people back to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Abijah </span>("whose father is Jehovah").--The coincidence of names in the sons of Jeroboam and Rehoboam is curious. Possibly it may be more than coincidence, if (as seems likely) the births of both took place about the same time, when Jeroboam was in favour with Solomon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span> [or <span class="accented">about</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) <span class="accented">that time</span>. The king is now settled at Tirzah (ver. 17). In <a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a> we left him residing at Shechem. The time referred to is that somewhat indefinite period mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33, 34</a>. These opening words clearly connect the sickness with Jeroboam's impenitence. What led the king to move his Court to Tirzah, Shechem being, as we have already seen, not only the capital of Ephraim, but "the natural capital of Palestine," "its central situation, its accessibility, and its wonderfully fine water supply" giving it "advantages not enjoyed by any other city in the land" (Conder), we are not told; but it is interesting and instructive to find that it has one conspicuous disadvantage as a capital, viz., that it is "commanded by a hill on either side so close to the town, that the old geographer, Marino Sanuto, in the fourteenth century, considers the place to be untenable by any military force, because stones might be rolled clown upon the houses, from either Ebal or Gerizim" (Conder, p. 16. Cf. <a href="/judges/9-36.htm">Judges 9:36</a>). It is very probable that this consideration suggested the transfer, of which Ewald despaired of discovering the cause ("Hist. Israel," 4:23)] <span class="cmt_word">Abijah</span> [Rawlinson sees in the name, which means "Jehovah is his father," an indication that Jeroboam "did not intend to desert the worship of Jehovah." But the name was probably bestowed long before the schism possibly in Egypt. It is more likely that it connects itself, if with anything, with the message of Jehovah to him (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>). But the name was not uncommon - it was borne by a son of Rehoboam (ver. 31; compare <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, below), and inferences from names must necessarily be precarious] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Jeroboam fell sick</span>.
