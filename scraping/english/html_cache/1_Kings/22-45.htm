His reign is noted for religious reforms and efforts to bring the people back to the worship of Yahweh. He is often remembered for his alliance with the northern Kingdom of Israel, particularly with King Ahab, which was controversial due to Israel's idolatry. Jehoshaphat's acts include judicial reforms and the establishment of a system of judges throughout the land, emphasizing justice and adherence to God's laws.<p><b>along with the might he exercised</b><br>Jehoshaphat's might is demonstrated through his military and administrative achievements. He fortified cities and built a strong army, which included hundreds of thousands of troops. His military prowess was not only in numbers but also in strategic alliances, such as his cooperation with Ahab against common enemies. This might also reflects his ability to maintain peace and stability in Judah during his reign, contributing to the prosperity of the kingdom.<p><b>and how he waged war</b><br>Jehoshaphat's military campaigns included battles against Moab, Ammon, and Edom. One notable event was the battle at Ramoth-gilead, where he allied with Ahab. Despite the alliance, Jehoshaphat sought divine guidance, demonstrating his reliance on God even in warfare. His wars were often characterized by seeking prophetic counsel, as seen when he consulted the prophet Micaiah before going to battle with Ahab. This reliance on God in warfare is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, emphasizing faith over mere military strength.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah is a historical record that is referenced multiple times in the Old Testament but is not part of the biblical canon. It is believed to have been a detailed account of the reigns of the kings of Judah, similar to the annals of other ancient Near Eastern kingdoms. This reference underscores the historical nature of the biblical narrative, suggesting that Jehoshaphat's deeds were well-documented and recognized in his time. The mention of this book highlights the importance of historical records in understanding the full scope of a king's reign and the events that shaped the nation of Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and for his military and administrative reforms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, over which Jehoshaphat reigned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_the_chronicles_of_the_kings_of_judah.htm">The Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</a></b><br>A historical record that documented the reigns of the kings of Judah, including their deeds and accomplishments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Importance of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's reign is marked by his commitment to following God's commandments.

His discernment sets an example for testing every word against God&#8217;s revealed truth (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p>- Later, when Judah faced Moab and Ammon, Jehoshaphat led the nation in prayer and fasting (2 Chron 20:3-4), then advanced with singers praising the Lord (20:21-22).
