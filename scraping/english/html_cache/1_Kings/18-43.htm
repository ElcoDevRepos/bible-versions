Mount Carmel is a coastal mountain range in northern Israel, providing a vantage point to view the Mediterranean Sea. The sea often symbolizes vastness and mystery in Scripture, and here it represents the source of anticipated rain. Elijah's instruction to look toward the sea reflects his faith in God's promise to end the drought, as he had previously declared that rain would come (<a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>). This act of looking toward the sea is an expression of hope and expectation, rooted in the prophetic word.<p><b>So the servant went and looked, and he said, &#8220;There is nothing there.&#8221;</b><br>The servant's report of seeing nothing underscores the testing of faith and patience. Despite Elijah's confidence in God's promise, the initial absence of any visible sign of rain challenges human perception and understanding. This moment parallels other biblical instances where faith is tested, such as Abraham waiting for the promised son (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2-6</a>) or the disciples waiting for the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4-5</a>). The servant's report highlights the tension between divine promise and human experience, a common theme in the life of faith.<p><b>Seven times Elijah said, &#8220;Go back.&#8221;</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often signifies completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation week (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>) and the seven churches in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Elijah's insistence on sending his servant back seven times indicates perseverance and unwavering faith in God's word. This persistence is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching on prayer, encouraging believers to pray without ceasing (<a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>). Elijah's repeated command to "go back" reflects a deep trust in God's timing and serves as a model for believers to remain steadfast in prayer and faith, even when immediate results are not visible.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a significant role in demonstrating God's power over the false god Baal.

What begins with &#8220;nothing there&#8221; ends&#8212;just a verse later&#8212;with a small cloud that ushers in torrential blessing. Faith looks, prays, and looks again, confident that God will keep His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">Go again seven times.</span>--From this delay of the answer to prayer Elijah's example became proverbial for intensity and perseverance in supplication (<a href="/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>). The contrast is remarkable between the immediate answer to his earlier prayer (see <a href="/context/1_kings/18-36.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.">1Kings 18:36-37</a>) and the long delay here. The one was for the sake of the people; the other for some lesson--perhaps of humility and patience--to Elijah himself. When the answer does come, it fulfils itself speedily. The "little cloud" becomes all but immediately (for so "in the mean while" should be rendered) a storm blackening the whole heavens, borne by a hurricane from the west.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said to his servant</span> [of whom we now hear for the first time.

Van de Velde writes, "On its west and northwest sides the view of the sea is quite intercepted by an adjacent height. That height may be ascended, however, in a few minutes and a full view of the sea obtained from the top." Similarly the latest authority, Mr. Condor: "The peak is a semi-isolated knoll with a cliff some forty feet high, looking southeast .... The sea is invisible, except from the summit, and thus it was only by climbing to the top of Carmel, from the plateau where the altar may have stood, that the prophet's servant could have seen the little cloud," etc.] <span class="cmt_word">And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</span> [<span class="cmt_word">Cf.</span> <a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15-20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-164.htm">Psalm 119:164</a>. The idea here is that of sufficiency, of completion, rather than, as elsewhere, of covenant. And yet it must be remembered that Elijah was only praying for what God had already promised to grant (ver. 1). This earnest prayer for rain under these circumstances suggests that the former prayer "that it might not rain" (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>) had also been inspired of God. But it is worth considering whether Elijah's attitude was not one of reverent and assured expectation, as much as of prayer. When Rawlinson says that "the faithfulness and patience shown [by the servant] in executing this order without a murmur, imply devotedness of no common kind," he surely forgets that the drought had lasted for three years and a half, and that the servant had that day seen the fires of God descend at Elijah's prayer.
