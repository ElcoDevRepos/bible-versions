Galilee, located in the northern part of Israel, was a fertile and strategically significant region. The giving of towns indicates a form of payment or gratitude for services rendered. This act reflects the broader practice of land grants in ancient Near Eastern diplomacy. Solomon's decision to give towns in Galilee may also suggest the region's lesser importance to his central administration compared to Jerusalem and Judah.<p><b>to Hiram king of Tyre</b><br>Hiram was the king of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city-state known for its maritime trade and skilled craftsmen. The alliance between Solomon and Hiram was mutually beneficial, as Tyre had resources and expertise that Israel lacked. This relationship is further evidenced by Hiram's assistance in building the Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>). The mention of Hiram underscores the interconnectedness of ancient Near Eastern politics and the importance of international alliances.<p><b>who had supplied him with cedar and cypress logs</b><br>Cedar and cypress were highly valued for their durability and aromatic qualities, making them ideal for construction, especially in royal and religious buildings. The cedars of Lebanon, in particular, were renowned throughout the ancient world. This supply of timber was crucial for Solomon's building projects, including the Temple and his palace. The use of these materials signifies the grandeur and splendor of Solomon's reign and his commitment to fulfilling David's vision for the Temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-4.htm">1 Chronicles 22:4</a>).<p><b>and gold for his every desire</b><br>Gold symbolizes wealth, power, and divine favor in biblical literature. Solomon's accumulation of gold reflects his prosperity and the fulfillment of God's promise of wealth (<a href="/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). The phrase "for his every desire" suggests Solomon's extensive building projects and luxurious lifestyle, which later contributed to his downfall (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-13</a>). This abundance of gold also prefigures the wealth of the Messianic kingdom, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-9</a>, where the nations bring their wealth to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiram,_king_of_tyre.htm">Hiram, King of Tyre</a></b><br>A significant ally of King Solomon, Hiram was the ruler of Tyre, a prominent Phoenician city.
