The term "zealous" indicates intense devotion, often associated with the prophets who were called to uphold God's covenant. The "LORD, the God of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. Elijah's zeal can be compared to Phinehas in <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, who was also zealous for God's honor.<p><b>but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant,</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual decline of Israel, as they abandoned the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The covenant was central to Israel's identity, and forsaking it meant turning away from God's laws and promises. This apostasy was a recurring issue, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12</a>, where Israel repeatedly turned to other gods.<p><b>torn down Your altars,</b><br>The destruction of altars signifies a rejection of worship and a direct affront to God. Altars were places of sacrifice and communion with God, and their destruction indicates a deliberate move towards idolatry. This act parallels the actions of King Manasseh, who desecrated the temple (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-5</a>).<p><b>and killed Your prophets with the sword.</b><br>The killing of prophets represents the extreme measures taken to silence God's messengers. Prophets were God's mouthpieces, calling Israel back to faithfulness. The persecution of prophets is a theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen with Zechariah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>) and later with John the Baptist in the New Testament (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-29</a>).<p><b>I am the only one left,</b><br>Elijah's feeling of isolation is profound, reflecting the loneliness of standing for truth in a corrupt society. This sentiment is echoed by other biblical figures, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15-18</a>). However, God later reveals to Elijah that he is not alone, as there are still 7,000 in Israel who have not bowed to Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p><b>and they are seeking my life as well.</b><br>Elijah's life was in danger due to his opposition to the prevailing idolatry led by Ahab and Jezebel. This threat is a reminder of the cost of prophetic ministry and the reality of persecution for righteousness' sake, as Jesus later taught in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>.

His words invite us to share God&#8217;s passion for covenant fidelity, recognize the gravity of idolatry, uphold true worship, honor those who speak God&#8217;s word, trust that we are never alone, and remain steadfast when opposition arises. Though Elijah felt abandoned, the LORD revealed an unseen remnant and re-commissioned him, proving that God&#8217;s sovereign purposes stand firm even when circumstances appear darkest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And he said.</span>--The reply to the implied reproof is one of impatient self-exculpation and even remonstrance. He himself (it says) had been very jealous for the Lord; yet the Lord had not been jealous for Himself, suffering this open rebellion of the people, the slaughter of His prophets, the persecution to death of the one solitary champion left. What use is there in further striving, if he is left unsupported and alone? The complaint is like that of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/64-1.htm" title="Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,">Isaiah 64:1</a>), "O that thou wouldest rend the heavens and come down!" The zeal for God's glory, as imperilled by His long-suffering, is like that of Jonah (<a href="/context/jonah/4-1.htm" title="But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.">Jonah 4:1-3</a>); the impatience of the mysterious permission of evil, like that rebuked in the celebrated story of Abraham and the Fire-worshipper. In the Elias of the New Testament there is something of the same despondent impatience shown in the message from prison to our Lord: "Art Thou He that should come, or look we for another?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I have been very jealous</span> [Cf. <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, which the prophet may have had in his mind.

It is clear that many altars, similar to that on Carmel, had been built, and had been overturned], <span class="cmt_word">and slain thy prophets with the sword</span> [If the "hundred prophets" of <a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> escaped, of which we cannot be certain, others did not]; <span class="cmt_word">and I, even I only, am left</span> [See note on 1 Kings 18:22. It must be confessed that the <span class="accented">prima facie</span> view is that the prophets had been well nigh exterminated. But we must take into account the deep despondency with which Elijah spoke, and remember the correction which his words received (ver. 18)]; <span class="cmt_word">they seek my life, to take it away.</span> [The commentators are hopelessly divided as to the spirit and temper with which these words were spoken. Bahr, as before, is very positive that there is no complaint or murmuring against God on Elijah's part. He contends that the prophet has been led to Sinai simply by the earnest longing for a disclosure concerning the dealings of God, and for instructions as to his future conduct; and this view has the support of other weighty authorities. But it is extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that we have here at the least a "tacit reproof that God had looked on so quietly for such a length of time, and had suffered things to come to such an extremity" (Keil). St. Paul speaks of him as pleading with God <span class="accented">against Israel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. <a href="/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>), said certainly represents the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> he received as a connection. And the idea which this verse, taken in connexion with the prophet's flight (ver. 3) and his prayer (ver. 4), leaves on the unbiassed mind certainly is that in his zeal for God he resented not only the growing corruption of the age, but above all the frustration of his efforts to stay it. What burdened and vexed his righteous soul was that in the very hour of victory, when the people had confessed that Jehovah alone was God, he, the one solitary witness for the truth, should be driven from his post to escape as best he might, and to leave the covenant people to the baneful influence of Jezebel and her army of false prophets. It is the cry which we hear over and over again in the Old Testament, the complaint of the silence and apparent indifference of God, of the persecution of the righteous, and the impunity of evil doers.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have been very zealous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(qan&#183;n&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7065.htm">Strong's 7065: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, zealous, jealous, envious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
