The altar, built by Elijah, was drenched with water, making it humanly impossible for the sacrifice to be consumed by fire. This act was to demonstrate the power of God over the prophets of Baal. The use of water, a precious resource in a time of drought, underscores the faith and boldness of Elijah. The altar itself, made of twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel, signifies the unity and covenant relationship between God and His people. This event foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice, fulfills the law and the prophets, showing that God's power transcends natural limitations.<p><b>and even filled the trench.</b><br>The trench filled with water serves as a further testament to the miraculous nature of God's intervention. In ancient times, trenches were often used in sacrificial rituals to collect blood or other offerings, but here it emphasizes the impossibility of the sacrifice being consumed by natural means. The filling of the trench symbolizes the abundance of God's provision and the overflow of His power. This act can be seen as a type of baptism, representing cleansing and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of living water, symbolizing eternal life and the Holy Spirit's work in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who played a pivotal role in challenging the prophets of Baal and demonstrating the power of the one true God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The location where Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal and called upon God to demonstrate His power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>Pagan prophets who worshiped Baal, a false god, and were challenged by Elijah to prove the power of their deity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The structure built by Elijah to offer a sacrifice to God, which he drenched with water to demonstrate God's power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trench.htm">Trench</a></b><br>Dug around the altar by Elijah, filled with water to emphasize the miraculous nature of God's impending response.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/demonstrating_faith_in_action.htm">Demonstrating Faith in Action</a></b><br>Elijah's actions on Mount Carmel show that faith often requires bold and public demonstrations of trust in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_over_idolatry.htm">God's Power Over Idolatry</a></b><br>The soaking of the altar with water highlights God's supremacy over false gods and the futility of idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_expectation.htm">Prayer and Expectation</a></b><br>Elijah's preparation of the altar and prayer demonstrate the importance of expecting God to act in response to faithful prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_courage.htm">Obedience and Courage</a></b><br>Elijah's willingness to stand alone against the prophets of Baal teaches us about the courage required to obey God in the face of opposition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_miracles.htm">God's Provision and Miracles</a></b><br>The miraculous fire that consumed the water-drenched altar reminds us of God's ability to provide and perform miracles beyond human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_18_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 18:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_18_35_God_s_power_over_nature.htm">How does 1 Kings 18:35 demonstrate God's power over natural elements?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_trench_important_in_Elijah_s_act.htm">What significance does the water-filled trench have in Elijah's faith demonstration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_Exodus_17_6_s_provision.htm">How does this verse connect to God's provision in Exodus 17:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_in_impossible_times_3.htm">How can we trust God to overcome impossible situations in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_strengthen_faith_like_Elijah_s.htm">What steps can we take to strengthen our faith like Elijah's in 1 Kings 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_18_35_God_s_power_over_nature_2.htm">How does 1 Kings 18:35 demonstrate God's power over natural elements?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_water_important_in_1_Kings_18_35.htm">What is the significance of water in 1 Kings 18:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_18_35_Miracle_belief_challenge.htm">How does 1 Kings 18:35 challenge the belief in miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_elijah_prove_god_over_baal.htm">How did Elijah prove God's power over Baal's prophets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_implies_misinterpreting_scripture.htm">Where did Elijah challenge the prophets of Baal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_ahab's_evil_show_his_weakness.htm">How did King Ahab's wickedness reveal his weakness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_solomon's_pagan_altars.htm">1 Kings 11:7 -

The verse invites confidence that God not only meets challenges stacked against Him but triumphs so completely that His reality becomes undeniable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And the water ran round</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the waters went round</span>] about <span class="cmt_word">the</span> altar, <span class="cmt_word">and he filled the trench also</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the trench, which was only partially filled with the water of the twelve <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, he now filled to the brim] <span class="cmt_word">with water</span>. [The object of these repeated drenchings of the victim and altar was to exclude all suspicion of fraud. It would almost seem as if tricks not unlike that practised year by year at the Greek Easter at Jerusalem were familiar to that age. Some of the fathers expressly state that the idolatrous priests of an earlier time were accustomed to set fire to the sacrifice from hollow places concealed beneath the altar, and it was an old tradition (found in Ephrem Syrus, and Chrysostom) that the Baal prophets had concealed a man for that purpose beneath their altar, but that he had died from suffocation (Stanley). Bahr, however, sees in these 3 x 4 vessels of water a symbolical act. The significance of this combination, he says, is unmistakable (cf. "Symbolik" 1. pp. 150, 169, 193, 205), though we cannot be certain as to the precise meaning of the prophetic act. His only suggestion is that it points to abundance of rain as the reward of keeping the covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12, 23</a>). But all this is extremely precarious, and the more so as the pitchers may have been filled any number of times before the trench was full.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/18-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
