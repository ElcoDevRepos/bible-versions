Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division, was once a servant of Solomon and had been promised kingship over ten tribes by the prophet Ahijah (<a href="/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29-31</a>). His internal musings reflect his anxiety and lack of faith in God's promise. This introspection is reminiscent of other biblical figures who pondered in their hearts, such as Mary in <a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>, showing a moment of contemplation and decision-making.<p><b>Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David</b><br>Jeroboam feared the reunification of the kingdom under the Davidic line, which ruled the southern kingdom of Judah. Historically, the house of David was seen as the legitimate royal lineage, with God's covenant promise to David ensuring his descendants would rule (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Jeroboam's concern highlights the political tension and instability following the division of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. This fear led him to establish alternative worship centers in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), which was a direct violation of the central worship in Jerusalem and foreshadowed the spiritual decline of the northern kingdom. Theologically, this reflects a lack of trust in God's sovereignty and a reliance on human strategy over divine promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.

The phrase shows that the man who had just been lifted from overseer (<a href="/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>) to king (12:20) is now talking to himself instead of talking to God.<p>&#8226; God had already spoken clearly through the prophet Ahijah: &#8220;I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires; you shall be king over Israel&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-37.htm">1 Kings 11:37</a>). Jeroboam&#8217;s private words prove he is discounting that promise.<p>&#8226; Like Saul consulting himself rather than the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11&#8211;12</a>) or the rich fool reasoning within (<a href="/luke/12-17.htm">Luke 12:17&#8211;19</a>), Jeroboam relies on his own calculation.

So he resolves to change worship in order to secure the throne&#8212;showing how politics can distort faith when the heart is not anchored in God&#8217;s word.<p>&#8226; Ironically, by fearing the endurance of David&#8217;s house, Jeroboam testifies to the reliability of God&#8217;s promise to David, even while denying the equally reliable promise God had made to him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26</a> captures the precise moment Jeroboam lets unbelief steer his reign. God had promised him a lasting kingdom if he obeyed, yet his heart whispers that God&#8217;s word might not hold and that political strategy is safer than covenant trust. His inward fear of the enduring Davidic line sets him on a path to idolatry and national sin. The verse therefore stands as a literal, accurate snapshot of how a leader&#8217;s private thoughts, when not submitted to God&#8217;s clear promises, can redirect an entire nation away from true worship and into ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David</span> [It needed much less prescience than Jeroboam seems to have possessed to perceive that fortresses and armies would be of no avail for the defence of his realm, so long as Jerusalem remained the one sanctuary of the land. He clearly foresaw that if the people went up thither, as in time past, three times a year, to keep the feasts, the religious sentiment would in time reassert itself and sweep him and his new dynasty away. With one religion, one sanctuary, one priesthood, there could not long be two kingdoms. People who had so much in common would, sooner or later, complete the unity of their national life under a common sovereign. And we find, indeed, that so powerful were the attractions of the temple, and the religious system of which it was the centre, that "the priests and Levites that were in all Israel," together with the more devout laity, fell away to Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13, 16</a>), while the speech of Abijah on Mount Zemaraim (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>), proves that others as well as Jeroboam were well aware that the old religion and the new kingdom could hardly coexist.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/12-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jeroboam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3379.htm">Strong's 3379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeroboam -- 'the people increase', the name of two Israelites kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
