The bottom floor being five cubits wide reflects the architectural design and function of the temple. A cubit, approximately 18 inches, was a common unit of measurement in ancient times. The use of specific measurements indicates the precision and care in the temple's construction, emphasizing its sacredness. The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, suggesting the foundation of God's grace in the temple's structure.<p><b>The middle floor six cubits</b><br>The middle floor being six cubits wide shows a progression in the temple's design, with each level increasing in width. The number six is often associated with humanity, as man was created on the sixth day. This could symbolize the temple's role as a place where God and man meet. The increasing width may also reflect the temple's growing capacity to accommodate the needs of worship and service, highlighting the temple's function as a center of spiritual life for Israel.<p><b>And the third floor seven cubits</b><br>The third floor's width of seven cubits is significant, as the number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible. This could symbolize the temple's role in completing the spiritual journey of worshippers, bringing them closer to God. The progression from five to seven cubits may also reflect the journey from grace to spiritual perfection, aligning with the temple's purpose as a place of divine encounter and transformation.<p><b>He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple</b><br>The offset ledges were an architectural feature designed to support the upper floors without penetrating the temple walls. This design choice reflects a respect for the sanctity of the temple's structure, ensuring that the integrity of the walls was maintained. It also demonstrates the advanced engineering skills of the builders, who were able to create a stable and functional design that honored the temple's sacred purpose.<p><b>So that nothing would be inserted into its walls</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the holiness and inviolability of the temple's walls. By ensuring that nothing was inserted into the walls, the builders maintained the purity and sanctity of the temple. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual purity required of those who worship God, aligning with the biblical theme of holiness. The temple's construction without intrusion into its walls may also symbolize the unchanging and eternal nature of God's presence and covenant with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

According to Bahr, it was in order to preserve the great and costly stones of the temple intact; but others, with greater probability, hold that it was because it appeared unseemly to have the side chambers, which were for semi-secular purposes (cubicles, perhaps), made an actual part of the sacred edifice. Anyhow, it is clear that the beams rested on ledges made in the walls; but whether in the temple wall only, or in the outer wall of the side structure also, is uncertain. The preceding sketch will not only illustrate the difference, but will help the reader to understand the description preceding. In drawing (1) rebatements are showed only in the temple or inner wall, In (2) they are showed in both walls. In (1) the edifice is represented with a fiat; in (2) with a span roof. Keil decides in favour of the first arrangement (1), and Bahr says somewhat positively, "The outer wall of the structure had no rests." In fact, he suggests that the whole of this side building may have been of wood. It must be admitted that we do know that there were rebatements in the wall A, whereas nothing is said as to the outer wall B. It may also be reasonably alleged that the considerations of fitness and sacredness which forbade the insertion of the beams into the sanctuary wall would not apply to the outer wall, which was a part of the side structure only. Against this view, however, may be urged the extreme thickness of wall which this method of building would necessitate. For unless we suppose that the floor of the ground story rested on the rock, and so was quite detached from the building, we must suppose four rebatements, so that if the wall at the top were two cubits wide, it would be no less than six cubits (or nine feet) at the bottom. It is true that the walls of ancient buildings were of extraordinary thickness, but it must also be remembered that the temple was not fifty feet high. However, <a href="/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a> suggests that the outside wall (B) may have been five cubits in thickness, and, if so, the inner wall would hardly be less. Fergusson, therefore, has some justification for putting each wall down as five cubits wide; but on the whole, perhaps, the plan represented in (1) appears the more probable. The historian here digresses for a moment to speak of the remarkable and, indeed, unprecedented way in which the temple was built, The stories were shaped and prepared beforehand in the quarry, so that there was nothing to do on their arrival in the temple area but to fit them into their place in the building.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The bottom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;ta&#7717;&#183;t&#333;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
