The setting of night in this narrative highlights the unexpected and tragic nature of the event. Biblically, night can symbolize a time of trial or testing, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/91-5.htm">Psalm 91:5</a>, which speaks of the terror of night.<p><b>this woman&#8217;s son died</b><br>The death of a child is a profound tragedy, and in the context of <a href="/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a>, it sets the stage for Solomon's wise judgment. The death of the son is central to the narrative, illustrating the fragility of life and the deep sorrow that accompanies such loss. This event also serves as a catalyst for the demonstration of Solomon's God-given wisdom, as he discerns the truth between the two women claiming to be the mother of the living child.<p><b>because she rolled over on him</b><br>This phrase indicates an accidental death, a common concern in ancient times when families often shared sleeping spaces. The cultural practice of co-sleeping with infants was widespread, and the risk of such accidents was well-known. This detail adds authenticity to the narrative, as it reflects a realistic scenario of the time. Theologically, it underscores human fallibility and the unforeseen consequences of everyday actions, reminding readers of the need for divine wisdom and guidance in all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The king of Israel known for his wisdom, who is approached by two women with a dispute over a living child.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_women.htm">Two Women</a></b><br>Both are described as harlots living in the same house, each claiming to be the mother of the living child.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_child.htm">The Child</a></b><br>The living child is the subject of the dispute between the two women.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead_child.htm">The Dead Child</a></b><br>The child who died during the night, leading to the conflict.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_court.htm">The Royal Court</a></b><br>The setting where King Solomon hears the case and makes his wise judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_life.htm">The Value of Life</a></b><br>The tragic death of the child reminds us of the preciousness of life and the importance of protecting it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_carelessness.htm">The Consequences of Carelessness</a></b><br>The incident serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of negligence and carelessness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_divine_wisdom.htm">Seeking Divine Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon's role in this account underscores the importance of seeking God's wisdom in difficult situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_human_relationships.htm">The Complexity of Human Relationships</a></b><br>The account highlights the complexities and challenges in human relationships, especially when trust is broken.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The account points to the need for justice tempered with mercy, as demonstrated by Solomon's wise judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_3_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_3_19_Sin_s_deceitful_outcome.htm">How does 1 Kings 3:19 illustrate the consequences of sin and deception?
