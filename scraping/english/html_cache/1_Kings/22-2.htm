The "third year" refers to the third year of Jehoshaphat's reign, which began around 873 BC. This time marker is significant as it sets the stage for the events that follow, highlighting a moment of political maneuvering and alliance-building.<p><b>Jehoshaphat king of Judah</b><br>Jehoshaphat was the fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, known for his efforts to strengthen the kingdom spiritually and militarily. He is often remembered for his reforms and his commitment to the worship of Yahweh, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>. His reign is marked by a desire for peace and cooperation with the northern kingdom, Israel, despite their historical tensions and differing religious practices.<p><b>went down to visit</b><br>The phrase "went down" is a geographical reference, as Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, is situated on higher ground compared to Samaria, the capital of Israel. This journey signifies a diplomatic mission, reflecting Jehoshaphat's willingness to engage with Ahab, the king of Israel, despite the latter's reputation for idolatry and apostasy. This visit is a precursor to the alliance that would later lead to military cooperation.<p><b>the king of Israel</b><br>At this time, the king of Israel was Ahab, known for his marriage to Jezebel and the promotion of Baal worship, which led to significant religious and moral decline in Israel. Ahab's reign is characterized by conflict with the prophets of Yahweh, most notably Elijah. The interaction between Jehoshaphat and Ahab is significant, as it represents a complex relationship between the two kingdoms, balancing political alliances with religious convictions. This meeting foreshadows the events of the battle at Ramoth-gilead, where the consequences of their alliance become evident.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his efforts to follow the ways of the Lord and for his reforms to strengthen the spiritual and military state of Judah.

Counting from the cessation of hostilities with Aram, three full campaigning seasons have passed (compare <a href="/1_kings/22-1.htm">1 Kings 22:1</a> with 22:2).<p>&#8226; Three years is long enough for uneasy peace to grow stale&#8212;setting the stage for fresh political maneuvering, as seen again in <a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1&#8211;5</a> when Moab rebels after Ahab&#8217;s death.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over time is underscored; He appoints specific seasons for every purpose (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehoshaphat king of Judah</b><p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat, a godly reformer (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3&#8211;6</a>), now enters Israel&#8217;s narrative.<p>&#8226; His presence ties the southern kingdom to the north, echoing earlier royal encounters like the summit between Asa and Ben-hadad (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Though sincere in faith, Jehoshaphat sometimes aligned with questionable partners (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>), reminding us that even devoted believers must guard their alliances (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went down</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Went down&#8221; is geographic, not spiritual: Jerusalem sits higher than Samaria, so any journey northward descends in elevation (cf. <a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at movement toward potential compromise; whenever Judah &#8220;went down&#8221; to Israel, danger of syncretism lurked (see <a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The step illustrates how small decisions can lead to weighty consequences&#8212;soon Jehoshaphat will be entangled in Ahab&#8217;s war plans (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to visit the king of Israel,</b><p>&#8226; The unnamed king is Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3</a>), notorious for idolatry and injustice (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; A visit implies cordial diplomacy&#8212;likely cemented by the marriage of Jehoshaphat&#8217;s son to Ahab&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Such fellowship foreshadows later disaster at Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29&#8211;37</a>), illustrating <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>&#8217;s wisdom about the company we keep.<p>&#8226; Yet God will redeem the moment by sending prophetic truth through Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-13.htm">1 Kings 22:13&#8211;18</a>), proving that divine counsel accompanies His people even in risky contexts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; The single sentence of <a href="/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2</a> marks a dramatic hinge between peace and war.<p>&#8226; It shows God&#8217;s meticulous oversight of timelines, rulers, and even travel routes.<p>&#8226; Jehoshaphat&#8217;s descent to Samaria warns that godly intentions can drift when yoked with ungodly partners.<p>&#8226; The verse prepares us for the larger lesson of the chapter: listen to God&#8217;s Word above political convenience, for His counsel alone leads to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down.</span>--The fuller account of the Chronicles (2 Chronicles 17) notices that the early part of his reign had been marked by a continuance or increase of the prosperity of Asa; but (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.">1Kings 18:1</a>) adds, in significant connection, he " had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab," so that this prosperity was, at any rate in part, dependent on a change of policy from enmity to alliance, with apparently some measure of dependence, dangerous alike spiritually and politically, but probably thought to be a necessity.
