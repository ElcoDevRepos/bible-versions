The term "zealous" indicates fervent devotion, reminiscent of Phinehas in <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, who acted passionately for God's honor. "The LORD, the God of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, underscoring His power and authority. Elijah's zeal is a model for believers to remain steadfast in faith, even when surrounded by opposition.<p><b>but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant,</b><br>This phrase highlights the Israelites' breach of their covenant relationship with God, which was established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). Forsaking the covenant implies a deliberate turning away from God's laws and commands, leading to spiritual and moral decline. This apostasy is a recurring theme in Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12</a>, where the people repeatedly abandon God for idols.<p><b>torn down Your altars,</b><br>The destruction of altars signifies a rejection of true worship and a turn towards idolatry. Altars were central to Israelite worship, serving as places for sacrifices and offerings to God. The tearing down of these altars indicates a systematic effort to erase the worship of Yahweh, paralleling the actions of King Manasseh in <a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>, who erected altars to Baal.<p><b>and killed Your prophets with the sword.</b><br>The killing of prophets represents a violent rejection of God's messengers and their messages. Prophets were God's spokespeople, calling the nation back to faithfulness. The persecution of prophets is a theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the martyrdom of Zechariah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>). This hostility foreshadows the treatment of Jesus and His followers, as Jesus Himself notes in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>.<p><b>I am the only one left,</b><br>Elijah's sense of isolation reflects his despair and the perceived total apostasy of Israel. This feeling of being alone in faith is echoed by other biblical figures, such as Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15-18</a>). However, God later reveals to Elijah that he is not alone, as there are still 7,000 in Israel who have not bowed to Baal (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>), reminding believers that God always preserves a remnant.<p><b>and they are seeking my life as well.</b><br>Elijah's life is in danger due to his prophetic ministry, specifically from Queen Jezebel, who sought to kill him (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>). This threat underscores the cost of discipleship and the reality of persecution for those who stand for God's truth. Elijah's experience prefigures the suffering of Christ, who was also pursued and ultimately crucified for His mission (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is experiencing deep discouragement and fear after a great victory over the prophets of Baal.

Now he mourns the wider corporate guilt.<p>&#8226; Covenant unfaithfulness is always personal to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-20.htm">Jeremiah 3:20</a>).

That solitary act spotlighted how rare genuine worship had become.<p>&#8226; Throughout Judges, idolatry and altar-tearing went hand in hand (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-32</a>). The pattern repeats in Elijah&#8217;s day, showing that neglect of worship quickly erodes national morality.<p>&#8226; God values physical reminders of His covenant; their removal invites His discipline (<a href="/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and killed Your prophets with the sword</b><p>The hostility isn&#8217;t merely ideological; it&#8217;s violent.<p>&#8226; Obadiah earlier hid one hundred prophets to spare them from Jezebel&#8217;s purge (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>).

Paul experienced similar loneliness in Corinth until the Lord assured him, &#8220;I have many people in this city&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment teaches that faithfulness isn&#8217;t measured by visible majority but by quiet obedience (<a href="/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they are seeking my life as well</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s crisis is existential.<p>&#8226; Jezebel&#8217;s threat in <a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a> sets the immediate context. Elijah is not exaggerating; royal power stands behind the assassination order.<p>&#8226; David voiced comparable fears when Saul hunted him: &#8220;They seek my life&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/63-9.htm">Psalm 63:9</a>). Such laments are not complaints against God but appeals for protection.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s response&#8212;gentle whisper, renewed commission, and strategic alliances with Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15-17</a>)&#8212;shows He answers fear with purpose and provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s statement in <a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a> is both a confession of unwavering zeal and a cry of exhaustion. He contrasts his fidelity with Israel&#8217;s covenant breach, altar desecration, prophetic killings, and the personal threat he faces. The verse reveals a servant who feels alone yet speaks to the Almighty who commands angel armies. God does not rebuke Elijah for honesty; instead He meets him with presence, corrects his perspective, and recommissions him. The passage reassures every believer that the Lord acknowledges our zeal, notes our trials, preserves a faithful remnant, and empowers us to keep serving even when the culture seems overwhelmingly hostile.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</span> [Verbatim as in ver. 10. What are we to understand from this repetition of the former answer? Has the lesson of this theophany been lost upon him? Has he failed to grasp its significance? It is probable that he only partially understood its meaning, and it certainly looks as if he still felt himself an injured and disappointed man; as if the recollection of the way in which his work had been frustrated still rankled in his soul. But though the words are the same, it <span class="cmt_word">is</span> possible, and indeed probable, that the <span class="accented">tone</span> was entirely different; that instead of speaking, as he had spoken before, querulously and almost defiantly, he now, catching his inspiration from the still small voice, speaks with bated breath and profound self humiliation. The facts are the same. He repeats them, because they and they alone explain why he is there, and because he cannot see as yet how they are to be remedied. But he is now conscious of a misgiving as to the wisdom and piety of his course. He feels he has acted hastily and faithlessly, and has wanted to do God's work in his own rough way. He will go back, if it be God's will; he will be content to wait God's time, and to follow His leading. The commission which is straightway given him almost proves that he had experienced a change. It implies that he is now fitted for his high ministry.] <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_kings/19-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have been very zealous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(qan&#183;n&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7065.htm">Strong's 7065: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, zealous, jealous, envious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;
