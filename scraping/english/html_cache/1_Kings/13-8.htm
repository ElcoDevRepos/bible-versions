In this context, it refers to a prophet sent from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against King Jeroboam's idolatrous altar. This phrase emphasizes the authority and divine commission of the prophet, highlighting his role as a messenger of God's will.<p><b>If you were to give me half your possessions</b><br>This phrase underscores the prophet's commitment to God's command over any material gain. It reflects a common biblical theme where true servants of God prioritize obedience over wealth, reminiscent of Balaam's declaration in <a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>, where he refuses to curse Israel for any amount of money. It also foreshadows Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> about serving God rather than money.<p><b>I still would not go with you</b><br>The prophet's refusal to accompany the king or his emissaries signifies his adherence to God's specific instructions. This steadfastness is a testament to his integrity and dedication to God's word, similar to the resolve shown by Daniel and his friends in <a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>, who refused to defile themselves with the king's food and drink.<p><b>nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place</b><br>Eating and drinking in the ancient Near Eastern culture often symbolized fellowship and agreement. By refusing to partake in a meal, the prophet distances himself from the idolatrous practices of Bethel, maintaining his purity and separation from sin. This act of abstinence is akin to the Nazarite vow of separation and dedication to God, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. It also prefigures Jesus' own separation from sin and His call for His followers to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God from Judah to Bethel to deliver a message against the altar King Jeroboam had set up.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jeroboam.htm">King Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who led Israel into idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant religious site in the northern kingdom where Jeroboam established one of his golden calves, leading Israel into sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The altar at Bethel, which was a focal point of idolatrous worship established by Jeroboam.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_command.htm">The Divine Command</a></b><br>The instruction given by God to the man of God not to eat bread or drink water in Bethel, symbolizing separation from idolatry and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>The man of God's refusal to eat or drink in Bethel underscores the importance of adhering strictly to God's instructions, even when faced with tempting offers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/separation_from_idolatry.htm">Separation from Idolatry</a></b><br>By not partaking in the king's hospitality, the man of God demonstrates the need for believers to separate themselves from practices and environments that lead to idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_the_face_of_temptation.htm">Integrity in the Face of Temptation</a></b><br>The man of God's steadfastness serves as a model for maintaining integrity and faithfulness to God's word, even when pressured by authority figures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>The passage illustrates that following God's commands may require personal sacrifice and the rejection of worldly benefits.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>The account warns against compromising one's faith and obedience to God for the sake of comfort or acceptance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Kings_13_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Kings 13:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_prophet_reject_king_s_offer.htm">Why does the prophet refuse the king's offer in 1 Kings 13:8?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_8_Obedience_to_God.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:8 demonstrate obedience to God's commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Bible_stories_reject_world_for_God_s_truth.htm">What other Bible stories emphasize rejecting worldly rewards for God's truth?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_prophet_s_integrity_today.htm">How can we apply the prophet's example of integrity in our lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_8_God_s_will_vs_personal_gain.htm">What does 1 Kings 13:8 teach about prioritizing God's will over personal gain?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_he_reject_the_king_s_offer.htm">Why did the man of God refuse the king's offer in 1 Kings 13:8?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_8_on_obeying_God_s_commands.htm">What does 1 Kings 13:8 teach about obedience to God's commands?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Kings_13_8_Divine_vs_human_authority.htm">How does 1 Kings 13:8 illustrate the theme of divine authority versus human authority?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_kings_13.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Kings 13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_allow_concubines_in_the_bible.htm">Why did God permit concubines in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_happens_if_you_abandon_faith.htm">What does it profit to gain the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_lying_prophet_story_teach.htm">What lessons does the lying prophet story teach us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_god_in_temples_(1_kings_8_13_acts_7_48).htm">Does God dwell in temples?
