The use of oil in anointing signifies setting apart for a holy purpose, as seen in the anointing of kings and priests throughout the Old Testament. The blood on the altar symbolizes atonement and purification, essential for approaching God. The combination of oil and blood highlights the dual necessity of spiritual empowerment and cleansing from sin for service to God.<p><b>and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments,</b><br>Sprinkling the mixture on Aaron and his garments signifies the consecration of the high priest. Aaron, as the first high priest, serves as a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who is both anointed by the Spirit and offers His own blood for atonement.

Hence the remark of the apostle, "almost all things were by the law purged with blood" (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm" title="And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The sprinkling with oil and blood completes the ceremony of anointing, and suffices of itself for the sons of Aaron, in addition to their virtual participation in the anointing of their father (verse 12). "In the mingling of the blood and oil for the anointing seems to be taught that not sacrifice for sin alone suffices; but that with this must be joined the unction of the Holy Spirit" (Gardiner). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses next</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
