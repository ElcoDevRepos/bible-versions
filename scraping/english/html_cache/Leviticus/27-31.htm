This system was part of the Mosaic Law, serving both religious and practical purposes, supporting the Levitical priesthood and the community. The option to redeem, or buy back, part of the tithe indicates flexibility within the law, allowing individuals to retain some of their produce or goods if necessary. This reflects God's understanding of human needs and circumstances, providing a way for individuals to manage their resources while still fulfilling their obligations to God.<p><b>he must add a fifth to its value</b><br>The requirement to add a fifth (20%) to the value of the tithe being redeemed underscores the seriousness of the commitment to God. This additional cost served as a deterrent against casually redeeming tithes and ensured that the sanctity of the tithe was maintained. It also reflects the principle of restitution found elsewhere in the Law, where additional compensation is required when something dedicated to God is reclaimed (see <a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a>). This principle can be seen as a type of Christ, who paid the ultimate price for humanity's redemption, going beyond what was required to restore the relationship between God and man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.
