The bull is specifically chosen for the sin offering, symbolizing the need for purification and atonement. The high priest's actions are crucial as he represents the people before God. The bull, a valuable animal, signifies the seriousness of sin and the cost of atonement. This act prefigures Christ, who offered Himself as the ultimate sin offering (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12-14</a>).<p><b>and makes atonement for himself and his household</b><br>Before Aaron can intercede for the people, he must first be cleansed, emphasizing the holiness required to approach God. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders must be spiritually pure to lead others (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2-5</a>). The inclusion of his household underscores the communal aspect of sin and atonement, recognizing that the priest's family also needs purification. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that Christ, our High Priest, was without sin and needed no atonement for Himself (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>).<p><b>he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering</b><br>The act of slaughtering the bull is a vivid reminder of the cost of sin, requiring the shedding of blood for forgiveness (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). This ritual underscores the gravity of sin and the necessity of a substitute to bear the penalty. The personal nature of this offering for Aaron himself highlights the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood, contrasting with Jesus, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The slaughtering of the bull also points to the sacrificial system's temporary nature, fulfilled and completed in Christ's sacrifice on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
