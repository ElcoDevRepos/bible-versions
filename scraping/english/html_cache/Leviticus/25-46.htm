The concept of inheritance was crucial in maintaining family wealth and continuity. In the context of Leviticus, this regulation applied to non-Israelite slaves, distinguishing them from Hebrew servants who were to be released in the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's covenant people being set apart and treated differently from those outside the covenant community.<p><b>you can make them slaves for life.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the distinction between foreign slaves and Hebrew servants. While Hebrew servants were to be released after six years or during the Jubilee, foreign slaves could be held permanently. This reflects the socio-economic realities of the time, where slavery was a widespread institution. The Bible's regulations aimed to mitigate the harshness of slavery, ensuring humane treatment. This also foreshadows the New Testament's spiritual liberation through Christ, where all believers, regardless of background, are freed from the bondage of sin (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>But as for your brothers, the Israelites,</b><br>Here, the text emphasizes the familial and covenantal relationship among the Israelites. The term "brothers" underscores the unity and equality expected within the covenant community. This principle is rooted in the idea that all Israelites are descendants of Abraham and part of God's chosen people. This familial bond is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of the church as a family of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><b>no man may rule harshly over his brother.</b><br>This command prohibits oppressive leadership among the Israelites, promoting justice and compassion. The Hebrew word for "harshly" implies severity and cruelty, which God forbids among His people. This reflects God's character as just and merciful and His desire for His people to emulate these attributes. The principle of fair and kind treatment is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who calls His followers to love one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>) and to lead with servanthood rather than domination (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who are the primary audience of the Levitical laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where these laws were to be practiced.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who could be bought as slaves.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50 years, emphasizing freedom and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_cultural_context.htm">Understanding Cultural Context</a></b><br>Recognize the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, where slavery was a common practice.

They are co-religionists, who have been reduced to temporary servitude, but who are, nevertheless, fellow-heirs with them in the land of their possession. Hence the greatest consideration was to be shown to them in these adverse circumstances. The authorities during the second Temple have therefore enacted that there must be no difference between the daily food, raiment, and dwelling of the master and his Hebrew slave, and that the master and the servant are alike in these respects.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You may leave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1448;&#1501;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;l&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
