Canaan was a region known for its fertility and strategic location, which made it a desirable possession. The entry into Canaan marks a significant transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled existence, requiring new laws and practices.<p><b>which I am giving you as your possession</b><br>This emphasizes God's sovereignty and the divine gift of the land to the Israelites. It underscores the idea that the land is not earned by the Israelites but is a gracious gift from God, fulfilling His promises.

In the ancient Near East, mildew was a common problem due to the climate, and its presence in a house could render it unclean. This contamination serves as a test of obedience and faith, as the Israelites must follow specific purification rituals.

The verse calls God&#8217;s people then&#8212;and now&#8212;to steward His gifts responsibly, to recognize His hand even in affliction, and to submit every corner of life to His cleansing authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">When ye be come into the land of Canaan.</span>--We have here the first of four instances in Leviticus of a law being given prospectively, having no immediate bearing on the condition of the people of Israel (see <a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm" title="And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.">Leviticus 19:23</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.">Leviticus 25:2</a>). This may be the reason why it is separated from the law of leprous men and garments, which we should naturally expect it would follow, instead of being preceded by the law of cleansing, and why it occupies the position of an appendix. Because it is here said "the land of Canaan," the authorities during the second Temple maintained that this supernatural plague of leprous houses was peculiar to Palestine, and was unknown in any other country. They moreover adduce the words "in a house of the land of your possession" to account for the fact that houses in Palestine not in the possession of the Israelites,--i.e., houses of Gentiles--were exempt from this distemper, that the synagogues throughout the country which had no official dwelling-houses attached to them were never visited by this loathsome disease, and that none of the houses in Jerusalem were ever afflicted with it, because the holy city was never divided among the tribes. Whatever we may think of their interpretation, the testimony of these eye-witnesses who had to administer the laws of leprosy, that out of Palestine, that in certain houses in Palestine, and that in the whole of Jerusalem, this kind of distemper was unknown, remains unshaken.<p><span class= "bld">And I put the plague of leprosy.</span>--The plague is here described as a supernatural one, proceeding from the immediate hand of God. Ordinary leprosy, as we are told by the authorities in the time of Christ, comes upon man for the following sins: "for idolatry, for profaning the name of the Lord, unchastity, theft, slander, false witness, false judgment, perjury, infringing the borders of a neighbour, devising malicious plans, or creating discord between brothers." House leprosy is sent by God if the owner of a plot of land on the sacred soil builds his house with materials unlawfully acquired. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version of Jonathan renders the first part of this verse by, "And if there be a man who buildeth his house with stolen goods, then I will put the plague," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession.</span> This is the first instance of a law being given which has no bearing on the present condition of the Israelites. but is to regulate their conduct when they had come into the promised land. From the time of Abraham downwards, the assurance of their entrance into that land had been possessed by the people of Israel (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>), and the expectation of the speedy fulfillment of that promise had been quickened by their exodus from Egypt, and the preparations made to march through the wilderness. There would, therefore, be nothing surprising to them in receiving instructions to guide their conduct when the entrance should have been effected. As the question is one of leprosy, it is natural that it should be treated of with the leprosy of the human subject and the leprosy of garments; but as it is not of immediate application, it is placed at the end, and dealt with after the rest of the subject has been discussed, being appended to the law of cleansing the leper, instead of preceding it. <span class="cmt_word">And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession.</span> This expression has led to the idea that the leprosy of houses was a special infliction at God's hand in a manner different flora other inflictions or diseases; but the words do not mean that. All that is done is in a sense done by God, inasmuch as his providence rules over all; and, therefore, by whatever secondary cause a thing may be brought about, it is he that does it. It is God that feeds the birds (<a href="/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>), God that clothes the grass (<a href="/luke/12-28.htm">Luke 12:28</a>), nor does one sparrow fall to the ground without him (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). It is he, therefore, that <span class="accented">puts the plague in a house</span>, as the Lord of all things (cf. <a href="/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6, 7</a>, "I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things").
