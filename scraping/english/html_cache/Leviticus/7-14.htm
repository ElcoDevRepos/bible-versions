These were part of the grain offerings that accompanied sacrifices. The use of unleavened bread is significant, as leaven often symbolizes sin or corruption in biblical texts (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). The cakes were a tangible expression of gratitude and dedication to God, reflecting the purity and holiness required in offerings.<p><b>he must present one portion of each offering</b><br>This phrase indicates the requirement for a portion of the offering to be set aside specifically for the Lord. The act of presenting a portion signifies acknowledgment of God's provision and sovereignty. It also reflects the principle of giving God the first and best of what one has, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>). This practice underscores the communal and covenantal relationship between God and His people, where offerings are a means of maintaining fellowship and obedience.<p><b>as a contribution to the LORD</b><br>The term "contribution" here is often translated as "heave offering," which involves lifting or waving the offering before the Lord as a symbolic gesture of presenting it to Him. This act of dedication is a reminder of God's ownership over all things and the worshiper's role as a steward. It also prefigures the ultimate contribution of Christ, who offered Himself as a sacrifice for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>It belongs to the priest</b><br>The portion given to the priest highlights the provision for those who serve in the tabernacle. Priests, who mediated between God and the people, were sustained by the offerings brought by the Israelites. This system ensured that those dedicated to spiritual service were supported by the community, a principle echoed in the New Testament regarding the support of church leaders (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering</b><br>The priest's role in sprinkling the blood is crucial, as it signifies the atonement and reconciliation between God and the offerer. The peace offering, or fellowship offering, was unique in that it symbolized communion with God, often culminating in a shared meal. The sprinkling of blood is a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrificial death, where His blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins and the establishment of peace between God and humanity (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, to whom the offering is presented.

alongside the main peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13</a>).<p>- These baked goods echoed earlier grain-offering instructions (<a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4-11</a>) and reminded Israel that everyday food could become sacred when offered to God.<p>- Similar accompaniment appears in <a href="/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a> when breads are paired with consecration sacrifices, underscoring that fellowship with God includes ordinary provisions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must present one portion of each offering</b><p>- Out of every variety of cake, the worshiper lifted a single piece.<p>- This &#8220;one portion&#8221; honored God&#8217;s ownership of the whole batch&#8212;an ancient visual of <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, &#8220;Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your harvest.&#8221;<p>- By giving up a representative share, the worshiper acknowledged that every blessing, large or small, came from the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As a contribution to the LORD</b><p>- The word &#8220;contribution&#8221; signals a devoted gift, comparable to the &#8220;heave offering&#8221; in <a href="/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19-21</a>, where first dough was raised before God.<p>- Lifting the portion not only set it apart but declared it was wholly His, reinforcing the principle seen in <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a> that God deserves the best, not leftovers.<p>- The act deepened fellowship: peace offerings culminated in a shared meal (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>), so giving God His portion first affirmed His place at the head of the table.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It belongs to the priest</b><p>- Although offered to God, the portion was then assigned to His servant. God provided materially for those who served at the altar (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-11</a>).<p>- This provision illustrated <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul notes that &#8220;those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar.&#8221;<p>- The arrangement taught the community to value and support their spiritual leaders, just as today churches meet their pastors&#8217; needs so they may minister unhindered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering</b><p>- The priest who handled the life-blood, mediating between God and the worshiper (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), received the bread portion.<p>- This pairing of blood and bread prefigures the fuller communion found in Christ, whose blood reconciles and whose body feeds (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-12</a>; <a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>).<p>- The distribution emphasized that access to fellowship with God requires an atoning mediator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a> teaches that fellowship offerings included daily food&#8212;cakes&#8212;of which a representative piece was lifted to God, then given to the priest who had mediated with sacrificial blood.
