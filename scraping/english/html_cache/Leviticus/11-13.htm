The use of "detest" indicates a strong prohibition, reflecting the importance of maintaining ritual purity. In the broader context of Leviticus, these dietary laws are part of the Holiness Code, which sets Israel apart from other nations. The emphasis on detesting these birds underscores the need for the Israelites to adhere strictly to God's commands.<p><b>and they must not be eaten because they are detestable:</b><br>The repetition of "detestable" highlights the severity of the prohibition. In ancient Israel, dietary laws were not only about health but also about obedience and identity. By avoiding these birds, the Israelites demonstrated their commitment to God's covenant. This concept of detestability is echoed in other parts of the Old Testament, where certain practices and items are deemed abominable due to their association with pagan rituals or impurity.<p><b>the eagle,</b><br>The eagle is often seen as a symbol of strength and power in the Bible, yet it is listed here as unclean. This may be due to its nature as a bird of prey, which feeds on carrion. The eagle's inclusion in this list serves as a reminder that God's standards of holiness are distinct from human perceptions of majesty or power. In prophetic literature, the eagle is sometimes used metaphorically to describe nations or divine judgment, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/17.htm">Ezekiel 17</a> and <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>.<p><b>the bearded vulture,</b><br>The bearded vulture, also known as the lammergeier, is a scavenger that feeds primarily on bones. Its inclusion in the list of unclean birds is likely due to its diet, which involves consuming dead animals, a practice that is ritually impure. The bearded vulture's presence in the list emphasizes the importance of avoiding contact with death and decay, which are contrary to the life and purity that God desires for His people.<p><b>the black vulture,</b><br>Similar to the bearded vulture, the black vulture is a scavenger. Its role in the ecosystem as a consumer of carrion makes it unclean according to Levitical law. The black vulture's mention reinforces the theme of separation from death and impurity. In a broader biblical context, vultures are often associated with desolation and judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-15.htm">Isaiah 34:15</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>, where they symbolize the aftermath of divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including dietary laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/eagle,_vulture,_black_vulture.htm">Eagle, Vulture, Black Vulture</a></b><br>Specific birds mentioned in this verse that are considered detestable and unclean for consumption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The dietary laws in Leviticus, including the prohibition of certain birds, were part of God's call for Israel to be holy and set apart.

It will be seen that, whilst in the case of the two preceding divisions of the animal kingdom certain signs are given by which to distinguish the clean from the unclean animals, in the division before us a list is simply given of the birds which are unclean and prohibited. This absence of all criteria is all the more remarkable, since after some of the birds mentioned it is added "after his kind," or "after her kind" (see <a href="/context/leviticus/11-14.htm" title="And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;">Leviticus 11:14-16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-19.htm" title="And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.">Leviticus 11:19</a>), thus showing that kindred species were included in the prohibition, and that it was left to those who had to administer this law, to lay down some general signs by which the proscribed species are to be known. Hence the following rules obtained during the second Temple. Those birds are unclean (1) which snatch their food in the air, and devour it without first dropping it on the ground; (2) which strike with their talons and press down with their foot the prey to the ground, and then tear off pieces with their beak for consumption; (3) which "divide their feet" when standing on an extended rope or branch, placing two toes on the one side and two on the other, and not three in front and one behind; and (4) whose eggs are equally narrow or equally round at both ends, and have the white in the middle and the yolk around it.<p><span class= "bld">The eagle.</span>--As the king of the birds, the eagle stands first in the list. It denotes here all the species of the eagle proper. Arabian writers, scientific travellers, and the most distinguished naturalists, concur in their testimony that the eagle eats carrion when it is still fresh, thus harmonizing with the description in <a href="/job/39-10.htm" title="Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you?">Job 39:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm" title="The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.">Proverbs 30:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm" title="For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.">Matthew 24:28</a>, &c. The assertion, therefore, that the bird here meant is the Egyptian vulture, because the eagle disdains dead bodies and feeds only on what it kills itself, is erroneous. Besides the kindred dialects, all the ancient versions and the best Hebrew scholars place it beyond a doubt that <span class= "ital">Nesher </span>here denotes eagle. Afterwards, however, the carrion-kite and the golden vulture were also reckoned among the different species of eagles. Hence the allusion in <a href="/micah/1-16.htm" title="Make you bald, and poll you for your delicate children; enlarge your baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you.">Micah 1:16</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-19.</span> - The unclean birds are those which are gross feeders, devourers of flesh or offal, and therefore offensive to the taste, beginning with the eagle and vulture tribe. It is probable that the words translated owl (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">night hawk</span> (verse 16), <span class="cmt_word">cuckow</span> (verse 16) should be rendered, <span class="accented">ostrich, owl, gull</span>, and perhaps for <span class="cmt_word">swan</span> (verse 18), <span class="cmt_word">heron</span> (verse 19), <span class="cmt_word">lapwing</span> (verse 19), should be substituted <span class="accented">ibis, great plover, hoopoe.</span> In the case of the bat, we have again phenomenal language used.
