This was a regulated institution within the Mosaic Law, which provided specific guidelines on how servants were to be treated (<a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21:1-11</a>). The concept of servitude in Israel was distinct from the harsh slavery practices of other ancient cultures, as it included provisions for humane treatment and eventual release (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>).<p><b>shall come from the nations around you</b><br>The Israelites were instructed to acquire servants from the surrounding nations, which included groups such as the Canaanites, Moabites, and Edomites. This reflects the historical context of the ancient Near East, where nations often engaged in trade, including the exchange of labor. The Israelites were to remain distinct from these nations, yet they were permitted to engage in certain economic transactions with them. This distinction underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing their unique identity as His chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>).<p><b>from whom you may purchase them</b><br>The act of purchasing servants from other nations was a legal transaction in the ancient world. This phrase indicates that servitude was not based on race or ethnicity but was an economic arrangement. The purchase of servants from foreign nations was allowed, contrasting with the treatment of fellow Israelites, who could not be permanently enslaved (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-42</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and freedom, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, which serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_nations.htm">Foreign Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations from which the Israelites were permitted to purchase slaves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where these laws were to be observed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, emphasizing freedom and restoration, contrasting with the allowance of foreign servitude.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_context.htm">Understanding Context</a></b><br>Recognize the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, where servitude was a common practice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_and_ethical_considerations.htm">Moral and Ethical Considerations</a></b><br>Reflect on the ethical implications of servitude and how it contrasts with modern values of freedom and equality.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_freedom_in_christ.htm">Spiritual Freedom in Christ</a></b><br>Emphasize the spiritual freedom offered through Christ, which transcends earthly social structures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_and_justice.htm">Compassion and Justice</a></b><br>Encourage believers to practice compassion and justice in all relationships, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity.htm">Cultural Sensitivity</a></b><br>Approach ancient texts with cultural sensitivity, understanding the difference between descriptive and prescriptive passages.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_25_44_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 25:44?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_44_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Leviticus 25:44 align with God's justice and mercy principles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Leviticus_25_44_s_guidelines.htm">What cultural context influenced the instructions in Leviticus 25:44?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_44_vs_NT_slavery_teachings.htm">How does Leviticus 25:44 relate to New Testament teachings on slavery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Lev_25_44_to_modern_employment.htm">How can we apply Leviticus 25:44's principles in today's employment practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_44_on_God_s_covenant.htm">What does Leviticus 25:44 reveal about God's covenant with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_44_and_Christian_equality.htm">How does Leviticus 25:44 align with the concept of human equality in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Lev_25_44_allow_foreign_slaves.htm">Why does Leviticus 25:44 permit owning slaves from surrounding nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Lev_25_44_rights.htm">How should modern Christians interpret Leviticus 25:44 in light of contemporary human rights?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_lev_25_39-46_differ_on_servitude.htm">Why does the command to release servants (Lev 25:39&#8211;46) appear inconsistent with other biblical passages endorsing servitude?

Scripture distinguishes between Israelite &#8220;brothers,&#8221; who could only be indentured for up to six years before release (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>), and non-Israelites, addressed here.<p>&#8226; Servitude, while real, was regulated so that masters remembered they themselves had once been slaves in Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). This perspective guarded against cruelty (<a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) and pointed to the greater redemption God provides.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall come from the nations around you</b><p>&#8226; The covenant community was to remain distinct (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). Allowing foreign servants underscored that distinction while protecting fellow Israelites from permanent bondage.<p>&#8226; Even foreign servants could share in covenant blessings&#8212;joining in circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12-13</a>) and the Passover if they identified with Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44, 49</a>). God&#8217;s heart for the outsider appears repeatedly (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from whom you may purchase them</b><p>&#8226; Purchase acknowledged ownership, yet God set limits: killing a servant carried punishment (<a href="/exodus/21-20.htm">Exodus 21:20</a>); permanent maiming demanded freedom for the injured servant (<a href="/exodus/21-26.htm">Exodus 21:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Foreign servants were considered family property that could be inherited (<a href="/leviticus/25-46.htm">Leviticus 25:46</a>), but masters still had to rule &#8220;without harshness&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament light deepens the ethic: masters are to treat servants &#8220;with justice and fairness&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>) and remember their own Master in heaven (<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>).

While affirming the institution, God simultaneously regulates it, requires humane treatment, and invites even foreign servants into covenant privileges. The verse safeguards Israel&#8217;s distinct identity yet anticipates the greater freedom realized in Christ, where every believer&#8212;slave or free&#8212;receives full dignity and hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">As for thy bondmen and bondmaids which thou must have of the heathen, </span>&c. As the Law forbids the Israelites to have their brethren as bondmen, or employ them in menial work which belongs to the slaves, the Lawgiver anticipates a difficulty which the Hebrews might raise against these enactments. If they are not to be engaged in this work, who then is to do it? Hence the reply in the verse before us.<p><span class= "bld">Of the heathen that are round about you.</span>--These are to be purchased to do the necessary work.
