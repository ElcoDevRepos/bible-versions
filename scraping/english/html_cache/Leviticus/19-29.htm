The prohibition against prostitution is rooted in the understanding of sexual purity and the sanctity of family. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, temple prostitution was sometimes practiced as part of pagan worship, but Israel was called to be distinct and separate from such practices. The act of making one's daughter a prostitute would not only degrade her but also violate the covenantal relationship with God, who called His people to holiness. This command underscores the importance of protecting the dignity and purity of individuals, especially within the family unit.<p><b>or the land will be prostituted</b><br>The land of Israel was seen as a gift from God, a place where His presence dwelled among His people. The concept of the land being "prostituted" suggests that moral corruption and idolatry defile not just individuals but the entire community and the land itself. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has communal consequences, affecting the spiritual and physical well-being of the nation. The land was to remain holy, as it was the inheritance of God's people, and any defilement would jeopardize their covenantal blessings.<p><b>and filled with depravity</b><br>Depravity here refers to moral corruption and wickedness. The warning is that allowing such practices would lead to a society overwhelmed by sin, moving further away from God's standards. This phrase highlights the ripple effect of sin, where individual actions contribute to the moral decay of the entire community. The call to holiness in Leviticus is a call to resist such depravity and to live in a way that reflects God's character. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to live pure and blameless lives, shining as lights in a dark world (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was known for its pagan practices, including ritual prostitution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who desires holiness and purity among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter.htm">Daughter</a></b><br>Represents the family unit and the importance of protecting and valuing women within the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_purity.htm">Value of Purity</a></b><br>God calls His people to live in purity, both physically and spiritually.
