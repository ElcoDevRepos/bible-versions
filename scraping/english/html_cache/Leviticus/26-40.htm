In the context of Leviticus, confession is a necessary step for the Israelites to restore their covenant relationship with God. This concept is echoed in 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>, where confession leads to forgiveness and cleansing. The Hebrew word for "confess" implies a public admission, indicating the seriousness of the act.<p><b>and that of their fathers</b><br>This phrase highlights the generational aspect of sin and its consequences. The Israelites are called to recognize not only their own sins but also those of their ancestors. This reflects the biblical principle of corporate responsibility, seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the iniquity of the fathers affects subsequent generations. It underscores the importance of breaking the cycle of sin through confession and repentance.<p><b>in the unfaithfulness that they practiced against Me</b><br>Unfaithfulness here refers to the Israelites' breach of their covenant with God, often through idolatry and disobedience. This mirrors the spiritual adultery described in the prophets, such as Hosea, where Israel's relationship with God is likened to a marriage. The term "practiced" suggests a habitual pattern of behavior, emphasizing the need for a sincere return to faithfulness.<p><b>by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me&#8212;</b><br>Walking in hostility indicates a deliberate and ongoing opposition to God's will. This phrase suggests a lifestyle characterized by rebellion, akin to the "walking" imagery used in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> to describe one's life path. Hostility towards God is a serious charge, as it implies enmity with the Creator, a theme also found in <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>, where friendship with the world is equated with enmity against God. This underscores the need for reconciliation through confession and repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, the Israelites are God's chosen people, who are given laws and commandments to follow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivers His laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who establishes a relationship with the Israelites and sets forth conditions for blessings and curses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites receive the laws, including Leviticus, during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/confession_and_repentance.htm">Confession and Repentance</a></b><br>The act of acknowledging sin and turning back to God, which is central to the restoration process described in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_confession.htm">The Importance of Confession</a></b><br>Confession is a crucial step in restoring our relationship with God.

They must recognize not only that they have sinned, but that their sufferings have been a punishment for those sins at God's hand. This will work in them humble acquiescence in God's doings, and then he will remember his covenant with Jacob, and also his covenant with Isaac, and also his covenant with Abraham, and for the sake of the covenant of their ancestors, he will not east them away, neither will he abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break his covenant with them. Whether Jewish repentance has been or ever will be so full as to obtain this blessing, cannot be decided now. Perhaps it may be the case that all the blessings promised by Moses and by future prophets to repentant and restored Israel are to find their accomplishment in the spiritual Israel, the children of Abraham who is "the father of all them that believe" (<a href="/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>), seeing that "God is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham" (<a href="/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/26-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if they will confess</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;wad&#183;d&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
