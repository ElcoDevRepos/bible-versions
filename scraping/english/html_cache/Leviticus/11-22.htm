The dietary laws in Leviticus were part of the covenant between God and Israel, setting them apart as a holy nation. The permission to eat certain insects highlights the detailed nature of these laws and God's concern for the daily lives of His people. It also reflects the practical aspects of survival in the wilderness, where protein sources were limited.<p><b>any kind of locust,</b><br>Locusts were a common food source in the ancient Near East, especially in arid regions where other food might be scarce. They are rich in protein and were considered a delicacy in some cultures. The allowance to eat locusts is significant because it shows a distinction between clean and unclean insects, emphasizing God's provision and care for His people. In the New Testament, John the Baptist is noted for eating locusts and wild honey, which connects to this provision and highlights his ascetic lifestyle.<p><b>katydid,</b><br>The katydid, like the locust, is a type of grasshopper. Its inclusion in the list of permissible insects underscores the broader category of clean insects that hop on the ground. This reflects the importance of distinguishing between different types of creatures, a theme prevalent in Leviticus. The katydid's mention also points to the diversity of God's creation and His sovereignty over it.<p><b>cricket,</b><br>Crickets, another type of hopping insect, were also considered clean. This inclusion further illustrates the detailed nature of the dietary laws. The cricket's mention may also serve as a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God's guidance for their sustenance. The emphasis on specific insects highlights the broader principle of obedience to God's commands, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>or grasshopper.</b><br>Grasshoppers, like locusts, were a familiar and accessible food source. Their inclusion in the list of clean insects reinforces the idea of God's provision and the practical aspects of the dietary laws. Grasshoppers are often associated with abundance and provision in the Bible, as seen in the story of the plagues in Egypt, where locusts were used as a tool of judgment. This connection underscores the dual nature of God's creation as both a source of sustenance and a means of discipline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the dietary laws, who were called to be a holy nation set apart for God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including dietary regulations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts,_katydids,_crickets,_grasshoppers.htm">Locusts, Katydids, Crickets, Grasshoppers</a></b><br>Specific insects mentioned as permissible for consumption under the dietary laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The dietary laws were part of God's call for Israel to be holy and distinct.

It occurs no less than twenty-four times, and is in four instances wrongly rendered in the Authorised Version by "grasshopper" (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="/job/39-20.htm" title="Can you make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). It is the locust which constituted the eighth plague of Egypt (<a href="/context/exodus/10-4.htm" title="Else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into your coast:">Exodus 10:4-19</a>); which is described as committing the terrible ravages (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm" title="You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="/joel/1-4.htm" title="That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.">Joel 1:4</a>; <a href="/joel/2-25.htm" title="And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-7.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that all they that look on you shall flee from you, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? from where shall I seek comforters for you?">Nahum 3:7</a>); and which swarmed in such innumerable quantities that it became a proverb in the Bible, "like the locusts in multitude" (<a href="/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a>). From these characteristics the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>is supposed to be the flying migratory locust. The administrators of the law in the time of Christ described the <span class= "ital">arbe </span>by the name <span class= "ital">gubai, </span>which is the species most commonly eaten, and ordained the following benediction to be recited before eating it: "Blessed be He by whose word everything was created." The locusts which are still eaten by the Jews and other Eastern nations are prepared in different ways. Generally they are thrown alive into a pot of boiling water mixed with salt, and taken out after a few minutes, when the heads, feet, and wings are plucked off, and the trunks are dried in an oven or in the sun on the roofs of houses, and are kept in bags for winter use. They are also broiled or stewed, or fried in butter; or they are mixed with butter and spread on thin cakes of bread. In taste they resemble shrimps or prawns. There are shops in some Eastern towns where they only sell locusts, strung upon cords or by measure. The locusts thus form an antidote to the famine they create by the devastation which they commit.
