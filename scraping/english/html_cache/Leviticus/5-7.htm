The law makes allowances for those who cannot afford the standard offering, demonstrating God's understanding and compassion. This reflects the principle that God desires obedience and repentance over material wealth, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<p><b>he may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin</b><br>The concept of restitution emphasizes the need for atonement and reconciliation with God. Sin disrupts the relationship between humanity and the divine, and offerings serve as a means to restore that relationship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of atonement, which is ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who provides the ultimate restitution for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><b>two turtledoves or two young pigeons</b><br>These birds were more affordable than a lamb, making the sacrificial system accessible to all. Turtledoves and pigeons were common in the region, and their use in sacrifices is also seen in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>, where Mary and Joseph offer birds at the temple, indicating their humble status. This provision underscores the inclusivity of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>one as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was specifically for atonement of unintentional sins, highlighting the seriousness with which God views sin and the need for purification. This offering points to the need for cleansing from sin, a theme that is central to the message of the Gospel, where Jesus is described as the ultimate sin offering (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>and the other as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a symbol of complete surrender and dedication to God. It was entirely consumed by fire, representing the worshiper's total commitment. This offering prefigures the complete sacrifice of Jesus, who gave Himself wholly for humanity's redemption (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).

The poor man who was unable to bring a sheep or she-goat, might bring two turtle-doves, as these were plentiful and cheap in Palestine. (See <a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm" title="And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.">Leviticus 1:14</a>.) We have seen in the preceding verse that in the case of the trespass offering, as in that of the sin offering, the fat parts, or the choicest portion, had to be consumed on the altar, being "the bread of Jehovah," and that the residue was the perquisite of the priests. As the fat parts of the dove, or the portion for the altar, could not be separated from the bird, and as the burning of it wholly would destroy the character of the trespass offering, and make it into a whole burnt offering, two doves were brought. One represented the portion for the Lord, and hence was burnt on the altar, whilst the flesh of the other became the perquisite of the officiating priest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If he be not able to bring a lamb.</span> Sin offerings being not voluntary sacrifices but required of all that were guilty, and the four last-named cases being of common occurrence amongst the poor and ignorant, two concessions are made to poverty: two birds (one to be offered with the ritual of the sin offering, the other with that of the burnt offering), or even some flour (either three pints and a half or three quarts and a half, according as we adopt the larger or smaller estimate of the amount of the ephah), are allowed when the offerer cannot provide a lamb or a kid. There is thus typically set forth the freedom with which acceptance through the great propitiation is offered to all without respect of persons. The non-bloody substitute, being permitted only as an exception for the benefit of the very poor and only in the four cases above specified, does not invalidate the general rule that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. <p> CHAPTER 5:14-19 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
