Cannibalism is presented as the ultimate curse, a reversal of natural order and a sign of extreme desperation. In the ancient Near East, such acts were considered abhorrent and were often associated with divine judgment. This warning serves as a stark reminder of the severity of turning away from God's commands.<p><b>of your own sons and daughters.</b><br>The mention of "sons and daughters" emphasizes the personal and familial devastation that would result from disobedience. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, children were seen as a blessing and a continuation of one's lineage. The loss of children, especially in such a horrific manner, would be the ultimate tragedy. This phrase also connects to other biblical instances where disobedience leads to severe consequences, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a> and <a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a>, where similar situations are described during times of siege and famine.

It is not idle hyperbole but the sober climax of escalating curses that follow persistent rebellion.<p>- Cross references show the same prediction: &#8220;You will eat the fruit of your womb&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>); &#8220;Then mothers will eat their children&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>).<p>- History records literal fulfillment during sieges: see the desperate exchange in <a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a> and the lament in <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>.<p>- The thought jolts us. God is saying, &#8220;If you refuse My provision, you will be driven to do the unthinkable.&#8221; Persistent sin turns the blessings of the covenant table into a table of starvation (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the flesh</b><p>- &#8220;Flesh&#8221; underscores physical reality.

When every outward support collapses, even the most basic human bond is consumed.<p>- The flesh originally given by God to nourish life (<a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>) becomes the final object of hunger. Sin flips creation&#8217;s order on its head.<p>- The warning exposes how far a heart hardened against God can fall: the people who once ate the Passover lamb in hope (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8-11</a>) may end up eating their own children in despair.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of your own</b><p>- &#8220;Your own&#8221; personalizes the judgment; this is not strangers but family.<p>- God often stresses ownership to highlight accountability: &#8220;Your own way has brought these things upon you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-18.htm">Jeremiah 4:18</a>). Likewise, the suffering here is self-inflicted through covenant breach.<p>- There is also a bitter reversal: the children were meant to inherit blessing (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).

Refusing the LORD&#8217;s covenant leads to judgments so severe that parents in besieged cities will eat their children. The verse spotlights the depths of human depravity when God&#8217;s protective hand is withdrawn, confirms the trustworthiness of Scripture through its later fulfillment, and ultimately drives us to the cross&#8212;where another Parent gave His beloved Son so that repentant rebels might never face such horrors but instead share in the feast of everlasting life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons.</span>--The harrowing scene here described is also depicted in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/28-53.htm" title="And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the narrow place, with which your enemies shall distress you:">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>.
