The number seven in the Bible often represents completeness or perfection, reflecting God's creation week. This ritual signifies the complete consecration of the altar for holy use. The altar, central to Israelite worship, was where sacrifices were made, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The repeated action emphasizes the thoroughness required in dedicating something to God.<p><b>anointing the altar and all its utensils</b><br>Anointing with oil in the Old Testament signifies setting apart for a sacred purpose. The altar and its utensils were essential for the sacrificial system, which foreshadowed Christ's atoning work. The utensils, used in various offerings, highlight the detailed care God required in worship, pointing to the holiness and orderliness expected in approaching Him. This act of anointing underscores the importance of purity and dedication in worship practices.<p><b>and the basin with its stand</b><br>The basin, or laver, was used for ceremonial washing by the priests, symbolizing the need for cleansing before approaching God. This cleansing ritual prefigures the spiritual cleansing believers receive through Christ. The stand indicates the basin's stability and readiness for use, reflecting the constant need for purification in the priestly service. This element of the tabernacle service highlights the ongoing requirement for holiness and preparation in serving God.<p><b>to consecrate them</b><br>Consecration involves setting apart something as holy and dedicated to God's service. This act of consecration for the altar, utensils, and basin signifies their exclusive use for worship and sacrifice. It reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people to be set apart for His purposes. This consecration process points to the ultimate consecration of believers through Christ, who makes them holy and acceptable to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who performs the anointing and consecration of the altar and its utensils as instructed by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where offerings and sacrifices are made to God, symbolizing His presence and the people's devotion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_basin_and_stand.htm">The Basin and Stand</a></b><br>Used for ceremonial washing, representing purification and readiness to serve God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/anointing_oil.htm">Anointing Oil</a></b><br>A special blend used for consecration, symbolizing the Holy Spirit and God's sanctifying power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_ceremony.htm">Consecration Ceremony</a></b><br>A significant event where the tabernacle and its furnishings are set apart for holy use, emphasizing the importance of holiness in worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holiness.htm">The Importance of Holiness</a></b><br>The act of consecration underscores the need for holiness in worship and service to God.

Moses&#8217; sevenfold sprinkling marked completeness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). Similar sevenfold acts appear with blood in <a href="/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6</a> and with water in <a href="/numbers/19-4.htm">Numbers 19:4</a>, underscoring that nothing short of perfect holiness can stand before the LORD. <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21-22</a> recalls that &#8220;Moses sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle itself and all the vessels of the ministry&#8221;, foreshadowing the once-for-all cleansing accomplished by Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>anointing the altar</b><p>The bronze altar was the meeting place between sin and atonement. By anointing it, Moses affirmed that every sacrifice offered there belonged wholly to God (<a href="/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36-37</a>). Centuries later, believers draw comfort from Calvary&#8217;s altar, where &#8220;we have an altar from which those who serve at the tabernacle have no right to eat&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).

The detail reminds us that God values not only the headline moments but also the humble implements of service (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-24</a>). In New-Covenant worship, every gift&#8212;public or unseen&#8212;is sanctified when offered through Christ (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the basin with its stand</b><p>The laver provided water for priests to wash hands and feet before ministry (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>).

For believers, the laver anticipates the &#8220;washing of water with the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>) and the daily confession that keeps fellowship unbroken (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to consecrate them</b><p>Consecration means being set apart exclusively for God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/exodus/29-44.htm">Exodus 29:44</a>).

The act points forward to the perfect sanctification found in Christ, calling today&#8217;s believers&#8212;cleansed by His blood and indwelt by His Spirit&#8212;to live as fully consecrated people in every detail of life and service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times.</span>--That is, the altar of burnt offering.
