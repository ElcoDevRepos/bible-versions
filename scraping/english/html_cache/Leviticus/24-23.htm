This phrase highlights his role as a prophet and lawgiver. The Israelites were a covenant community, bound by the laws given at Sinai, and Moses was their guide in understanding and implementing these laws.<p><b>and they took the blasphemer outside the camp</b><br>The act of taking the blasphemer outside the camp signifies the removal of sin and impurity from the community. In ancient Israel, the camp represented the dwelling place of God's people, and maintaining its holiness was crucial. This practice is consistent with other instances in the Torah where those who were unclean or had committed serious offenses were taken outside the camp (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of Jesus being crucified outside the city (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>), symbolizing the bearing of sin and separation from the community.<p><b>and stoned him</b><br>Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, prescribed for various offenses, including blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). This method of execution involved the community, emphasizing collective responsibility in upholding God's law. The severity of the punishment underscores the seriousness of blasphemy, which was seen as a direct affront to God's holiness and authority.<p><b>So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase indicates the obedience of the Israelites to God's commands, as relayed by Moses. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where blessings were contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The Israelites' compliance also serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to divine instructions, a theme that runs throughout the Bible.

He does not invent a penalty; he relays what he has already received from the Lord moments earlier (<a href="/leviticus/24-13.htm">Leviticus 24:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, the pattern is clear: God speaks, His servant conveys the message, and the people are held accountable (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God still chooses to communicate His will through His revealed Word. Just as Israel had to listen to Moses, believers today must give attentive obedience to the whole counsel of Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they took the blasphemer outside the camp</b><p>&#8226; Removing the offender preserves the holiness of the community. &#8220;Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>) echoes earlier instructions on dealing with serious uncleanness (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Outside the camp&#8221; prefigures the greater sacrifice of Christ, who &#8220;also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people by His own blood&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>). Holiness demands separation from sin, yet grace ultimately answers that demand in Christ.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s action underscores the communal responsibility to guard God&#8217;s honor. Holiness is not an individual option but a corporate mandate (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stoned him</b><p>&#8226; Stoning is the divinely prescribed penalty for blasphemy (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>). It is swift, public, and carried out by the congregation, emphasizing that every Israelite stands against contempt for God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35-36</a>).<p>&#8226; Blasphemy is more than a careless word; it is a direct assault on the character and authority of God (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The severity of the sentence highlights the infinite worth of God&#8217;s name.<p>&#8226; This judgment foreshadows the sobering truth that &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Only in the cross, where Jesus bore the curse for us (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>), do we find deliverance from such rightful condemnation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><p>&#8226; Obedience is immediate and complete. No committee, no delay&#8212;just prompt submission (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-54.htm">Numbers 1:54</a>).<p>&#8226; Their compliance safeguards the covenant relationship. Blessing follows obedience; judgment follows disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse closes the account by affirming that God&#8217;s law, not human sentiment, sets the standard. The incident becomes a living lesson that reverence for God&#8217;s name is non-negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/24-23.htm">Leviticus 24:23</a> records Israel&#8217;s faithful execution of God&#8217;s explicit command regarding blasphemy. Moses conveys the Lord&#8217;s directive, the people separate the offender to preserve holiness, they carry out the prescribed judgment, and they finish in full obedience. The passage showcases God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness, the seriousness of sin, and the necessity of wholehearted submission to His Word&#8212;truths that still instruct and sober us today, while pointing us to the only hope of sinners: the saving work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And Moses spake to the children of Israel.</span>--Having recited the laws which were promulgated in consequence of the appeal made to God, Moses now calls upon the people to execute the sentence which the Lord pronounced against the blasphemer.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The penalty is inflicted on the offender solemnly as an act of the Law, not of mob fury. So it was by a judicial or semi-judicial proceeding that St. Stephen was stoned: "They brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law" (<a href="/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12, 13</a>). And in spite of the violence exhibited, there was still some form of law, according to Jewish practice, observed in his stoning (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). In the case of our Lord, on the other hand. when they regarded him as guilty of blasphemy on his saying, "Before Abraham was, I am" (<a href="/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>), and "I and my Father are one" (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>), the Jews "took up stones to cast at him," not waiting for a judicial condemnation, but, as they supposed, taking the law into their own hands. Had his death been by Jewish hands, it would at the last have been by stoning under this law. But the power of life and death had been taken away from the Jews by the Romans, "that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die" (<a href="/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/24-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
