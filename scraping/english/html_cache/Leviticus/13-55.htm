This reflects the importance of cleanliness and ritual purity in ancient Israelite society. Washing symbolizes an attempt to remove impurity, paralleling spiritual cleansing seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, where David asks God to wash away his iniquity.<p><b>the priest is to reexamine it</b><br>The role of the priest as an examiner underscores the priestly duty to maintain holiness within the community. Priests acted as mediators between God and the people, ensuring that the community adhered to God's laws. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual oversight and accountability, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>.<p><b>and if the mildewed article has not changed in appearance</b><br>The unchanged appearance of mildew signifies persistent impurity. In biblical symbolism, mildew and leprosy often represent sin and corruption. The unchanged state after washing suggests the need for deeper intervention, akin to the need for repentance and transformation in the believer's life (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>it is unclean</b><br>Declaring an item unclean meant it was not fit for use in worship or daily life. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God is holy and requires His people to be separate from impurity (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). The concept of uncleanness also points to the need for redemption and purification through Christ.<p><b>Even though the mildew has not spread</b><br>The lack of spread indicates that the issue is not one of contagion but of inherent impurity. This can be seen as a metaphor for sin, which may not always manifest outwardly but still requires cleansing. It highlights the need for vigilance in spiritual matters, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, where a little leaven leavens the whole lump.<p><b>you must burn it</b><br>Burning the unclean item signifies total destruction, a common biblical method for dealing with impurity (<a href="/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>). This act of destruction serves as a warning against tolerating sin and impurity. It foreshadows the ultimate judgment and purification that Christ brings, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>.<p><b>whether the rot is on the front or back</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the thoroughness required in dealing with impurity. It suggests that no part of the item is exempt from examination and potential destruction. This thoroughness is mirrored in the call for believers to examine their lives fully and remove all sin, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as the mediator and examiner, responsible for determining the cleanliness of the article.

God allowed for a first-round effort to rescue the garment, showing His mercy and desire that what can be saved, be saved (cf. <a href="/leviticus/13-58.htm">Leviticus 13:58</a>).<p>&#8226; The washing represents every possible human effort to deal with contamination before a final verdict is rendered, much as Israel was told to &#8220;wash yourselves, cleanse yourselves&#8221; of sin (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the effectiveness of that washing is determined by God&#8217;s appointed standard, not by human opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest is to reexamine it</b><p>The priest&#8212;a mediator appointed by God&#8212;must inspect the garment again. This re-inspection echoes <a href="/leviticus/13-13.htm">Leviticus 13:13</a> and <a href="/leviticus/14-48.htm">Leviticus 14:48</a>, where the priest&#8217;s verdict carries divine authority.<p>&#8226; No self-diagnosis is allowed; holiness is assessed by the measure God gives through His ordained servants (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle continues today: shepherds of the church are commanded to guard the flock from corrupting influences (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if the mildewed article has not changed in appearance</b><p>Stagnant appearance after washing shows that the mildew is deeper than the surface. It has resisted the prescribed cleansing (<a href="/leviticus/13-6.htm">Leviticus 13:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Outward scrubbing cannot reach what is rooted within; sin that clings beneath the surface requires more than cosmetic change (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p>&#8226; True repentance manifests visible change (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). Lack of change exposes a deeper problem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is unclean</b><p>The declaration &#8220;it is unclean&#8221; labels the garment unfit for use among God&#8217;s people (<a href="/leviticus/11-47.htm">Leviticus 11:47</a>).<p>&#8226; Uncleanness is not merely ceremonial; it pictures moral defilement that separates from God (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The verdict is final unless God Himself provides a new means of cleansing&#8212;foreshadowing the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ that truly purifies (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even though the mildew has not spread</b><p>God&#8217;s standard is not limited to outward progression. If stubborn contamination remains, judgment falls even without visible spread (<a href="/leviticus/13-53.htm">Leviticus 13:53</a>).<p>&#8226; A little leaven still leavens the whole lump (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Tolerating any entrenched defilement invites future corruption; therefore God requires decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you must burn it</b><p>The only remedy left is complete destruction by fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Fire ensures that the impurity cannot return, symbolizing God&#8217;s consuming holiness (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers mirror this by removing and destroying anything that fosters sin&#8212;illustrated when new believers in Ephesus burned their occult books (<a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whether the rot is on the front or back</b><p>No part of the garment is exempt; any location of rot demands the same response. God&#8217;s holiness is impartial (2 Chron 19:7; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Hidden areas matter as much as visible ones. Secret sin must be treated with the same seriousness as public failure.<p>&#8226; Total integrity is God&#8217;s expectation; partial purity is not enough (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a> teaches that when contamination resists God-ordained cleansing, decisive judgment follows. A washed but unchanged garment illustrates a life that goes through external motions without inward transformation. God&#8217;s appointed overseers must declare it unclean, and complete removal&#8212;symbolized by burning&#8212;protects the community and honors God&#8217;s holiness.
