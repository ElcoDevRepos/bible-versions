The concept of redemption is central to the biblical narrative, symbolizing God's deliverance of His people. The inability to be redeemed by human means highlights the need for divine intervention, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ.<p><b>he and his children shall be released</b><br>The release of the servant and his children emphasizes the restoration of family and property, reflecting God's justice and mercy. This provision ensures that servitude is not permanent, aligning with the biblical theme of liberation. It also underscores the importance of family continuity and inheritance in Israelite society, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>in the Year of Jubilee.</b><br>The Year of Jubilee, occurring every 50th year, was a time of liberation and restoration, where debts were forgiven, and land was returned to original owners. This practice is unique to Israel and reflects God's sovereignty over the land and His desire for social equality.
