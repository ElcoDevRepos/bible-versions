The burning of the memorial portion signifies the offering being set apart for God. This act of burning is a symbolic gesture of dedication and remembrance, highlighting the importance of offering the first and best to God. The memorial portion represents a token of the whole, acknowledging God's provision and sovereignty.<p><b>of the crushed grain and the oil</b><br>Crushed grain, often barley or wheat, was a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizing sustenance and life. The inclusion of oil, a valuable commodity, signifies richness and blessing. Together, they represent the basic elements of life and God's provision. This offering is a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God for their daily needs, echoing the prayer for "daily bread" in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><b>together with all its frankincense</b><br>Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was used in worship and symbolized prayer and praise ascending to God. Its inclusion in the offering elevates the act of giving, transforming a simple grain offering into a fragrant sacrifice pleasing to the Lord. This mirrors the New Testament concept of believers' prayers being like incense before God (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>).<p><b>as a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The term "food offering" underscores the idea of fellowship and communion with God. While God does not need physical sustenance, the offering represents the worshiper's desire to honor and please Him. This act of offering is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), fulfilling the spiritual nourishment symbolized by the grain offering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the people and God, performing the ritual duties required by the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/memorial_portion.htm">Memorial Portion</a></b><br>This refers to a part of the grain offering that is burned on the altar as a remembrance before God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crushed_grain.htm">Crushed Grain</a></b><br>Represents the offering of the firstfruits of the harvest, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oil.htm">Oil</a></b><br>Used in offerings to signify richness and the presence of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/frankincense.htm">Frankincense</a></b><br>A fragrant resin used in offerings, symbolizing prayer and worship ascending to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_offerings.htm">Symbolism of Offerings</a></b><br>The grain offering symbolizes dedication and thanksgiving.
