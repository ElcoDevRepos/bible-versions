The preparation of the second bird as a burnt offering signifies complete dedication to God, as burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire. This reflects the principle of total surrender and devotion. The use of birds, often turtledoves or pigeons, indicates provision for those who could not afford larger animals, highlighting God's inclusivity and provision for all economic classes. The ordinance refers to the specific instructions given by God, emphasizing the importance of obedience and the detailed nature of worship in the Old Testament. This sacrificial system foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers Himself as the perfect atonement for sin.<p><b>In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed,</b><br>Atonement in the Old Testament involves covering or cleansing from sin, restoring the relationship between the sinner and God. The priest's role in making atonement underscores the necessity of an intermediary, pointing to the future role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest. The phrase "for the sin he has committed" acknowledges personal responsibility and the need for confession and repentance. This process of atonement is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, who provides a once-for-all atonement for sin.<p><b>and he will be forgiven.</b><br>Forgiveness is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments, representing God's grace and mercy. In the context of Leviticus, forgiveness is granted through the sacrificial system, which temporarily covers sin. This anticipates the complete and eternal forgiveness offered through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The assurance of forgiveness in this passage provides hope and peace to the believer, reflecting God's desire for reconciliation and relationship with His people. The concept of forgiveness is further expanded in the New Testament, where it is available to all who believe in Christ, emphasizing the universality and sufficiency of His atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the people and God, performing the sacrificial rituals necessary for atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who are given the laws and instructions for maintaining a right relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice required for atonement of unintentional sins, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering that is completely consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices are made, representing God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The concept of atonement in Leviticus underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for a mediator.

The first bird is a sin offering; the &#8220;second bird&#8221; is now offered as a burnt offering, completely consumed on the altar (see <a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;According to the ordinance&#8221; signals that God&#8212;not the worshiper&#8212;sets the terms of acceptable worship (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>). Every detail points to His holiness and to the need for substitution.<p>&#8226; The total burning of the sacrifice pictures wholehearted surrender (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). It also foreshadows the once-for-all offering of Christ, who gave Himself entirely for us (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In this way the priest will make atonement for him</b><p>&#8226; Atonement means &#8220;covering.&#8221; By God&#8217;s design, innocent blood covers guilty sin (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest serves as mediator, applying the sacrifice on behalf of the sinner (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in this way&#8221; shows there is no atonement by personal merit or creativity&#8212;only by the divinely prescribed sacrifice (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the sin he has committed</b><p>&#8226; Sin is not an abstract problem; it is personal and specific. The worshiper openly owns his offense, bringing it to God&#8217;s remedy (<a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly underlines individual accountability: &#8220;all have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), and even &#8220;one point&#8221; of violation makes a person guilty (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This clears the fog of self-justification; we stand exposed yet invited to cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he will be forgiven</b><p>&#8226; Forgiveness is God&#8217;s emphatic final word when His terms are met. &#8220;The priest will make atonement&#8230; and he will be forgiven&#8221; (compare <a href="/leviticus/4-35.htm">Leviticus 4:35</a>; 6:7).<p>&#8226; The promise is immediate and complete&#8212;no probationary period, no lingering debt (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ, the pattern finds its ultimate fulfillment: &#8220;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a> reveals a God who lovingly provides a way for anyone&#8212;rich or poor&#8212;to receive full forgiveness. A prescribed, wholehearted burnt offering follows the sin offering, showing that cleansing leads to consecration. The priest&#8217;s mediation, the atoning blood, the acknowledgment of personal sin, and the assured pardon all foreshadow the perfect, once-for-all work of Jesus Christ.
