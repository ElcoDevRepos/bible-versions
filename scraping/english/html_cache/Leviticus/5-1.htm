In ancient Israel, the legal system relied heavily on the testimony of witnesses. The failure to testify when one has relevant information is considered a sin, highlighting the importance of truth and justice in the community. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/19-5.htm">Proverbs 19:5</a>, which warns against false witnesses and underscores the moral obligation to uphold truth.<p><b>when he hears a public charge about something he has witnessed</b><br>The context here involves a public charge, indicating a formal accusation or legal proceeding. Witnesses were crucial in establishing facts, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires the testimony of two or three witnesses to establish a matter. The communal aspect of justice is emphasized, as the integrity of the legal process depends on the willingness of individuals to come forward with the truth.<p><b>whether he has seen it or learned of it</b><br>This phrase expands the responsibility to testify beyond direct observation to include information learned indirectly. It underscores the comprehensive nature of the obligation to truth, as both firsthand and reliable secondhand knowledge are relevant. This reflects the broader biblical principle of accountability for one's knowledge and actions, as seen in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, which states that knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it is sin.<p><b>he shall bear the iniquity</b><br>The consequence of failing to testify is bearing the iniquity, indicating personal responsibility for the sin. This reflects the biblical theme of individual accountability before God, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, which states that the soul who sins shall die. The concept of bearing iniquity also points to the need for atonement, a central theme in Leviticus, ultimately fulfilled in the New Testament by Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/witness.htm">Witness</a></b><br>An individual who has seen or learned of an event or fact and is called upon to testify.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/public_adjuration.htm">Public Adjuration</a></b><br>A formal and solemn command or request made publicly, often in a legal or religious context, requiring individuals to testify truthfully.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin.htm">Sin</a></b><br>The act of failing to testify when required, which is considered a transgression against God's law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The guilt or moral wrongdoing that one bears as a result of failing to fulfill the obligation to testify.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which these laws were given, emphasizing communal responsibility and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_witnesses.htm">The Responsibility of Witnesses</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to uphold truth and justice.

The first instance adduced is that of failing to come forward as witness after the judicial adjuration has been uttered. It was the duty of every member of the community to aid the authorities in maintaining the integrity of the Divine law. Hence, when an offence was committed which the constituted tribunals were unable to bring home to the offender for want of evidence, a solemn adjuration was addressed by the judge to individual members, to a district, or to the whole community. If after such an adjuration, anyone who was cognizant of the offence failed to come forward to testify what he knew, he was considered in the sight of God as participating in the transgression which he had thus concealed. It is with reference to this law that we are told, "whoso is partner with a thief, hateth his own soul, he heareth cursing and betrayeth it not," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he hears the adjuration of the judges, and yet stifles his evidence, and thus becomes a partner with the culprit. An instance of this adjuration is recorded in <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>, where the high priest said to Jesus, "I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the son of God," and it was in recognition of the solemn obligation of this adjuration that Jesus answered the question.<p><span class= "bld">Then he shall bear his iniquity.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and he beareth his iniquity; </span>that is, he is sensible that he bears the load of this guilt, he has become conscious of his sin, without which he could not bring the sacrifice here prescribed. The phrase, "and he beareth his guilt," has the same meaning as and "he," or "they are guilty" in <a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm" title="And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;">Leviticus 4:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-22.htm" title="When a ruler has sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;">Leviticus 4:22</a>, &c. Unlike the sins committed inadvertently, spoken of in the preceding chapter, where the sin offering is prescribed, the guilt here described is that of designed and culpable silence, and of deliberately concealing a crime.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The case of a witness on oath. If a man <span class="cmt_word">hear the voice of swearing</span>, that is, if he was one of a number of persons adjured to speak according to the manner in which oaths were administered in Jewish courts of justice (see <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-15.htm">2 Chronicles 18:15</a>), and he did not give evidence of what he had seen or heard, he had to <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, he was regarded as guilty; and as this was an offense which could be atoned for by a sacrifice, he was to offer as a sin offering a ewe lamb, or a female kid, or two turtle-doves, or two pigeons, or the tenth part of an ephah of flour. This injunction is a direct condemnation of the approved teaching of Italian moral theologians of paramount authority throughout the Roman Church, who maintain that, in case a crime is not known to others, a witness in a court of justice "may, nay, he is bound to, say that the accused has not committed it" (St. Alfonso de' Liguori, 'Theol. Mor.,' 4:154). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">someone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1443;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ne&#183;p&#772;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
