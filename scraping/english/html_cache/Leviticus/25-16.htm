The Jubilee, occurring every 50 years, was a time when land was returned to its original family owners (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). This system ensured that the price of land was fair and just, reflecting the potential productivity of the land until the Jubilee. The principle underscores the importance of fairness and justice in economic transactions, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>). It also highlights the temporary stewardship of land, reminding the Israelites that the land ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p><b>or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the inverse relationship between the number of years until the Jubilee and the price of the land. As the Jubilee approached, the value of the land decreased because the buyer would have fewer harvests before the land reverted to its original owner. This system prevented exploitation and ensured that the poor could regain their ancestral land, reflecting God's concern for social justice and care for the marginalized (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption and restoration found in Christ, who restores what is lost and brings freedom to captives (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><b>for he is selling you a given number of harvests</b><br>This phrase clarifies that the transaction is not about the land itself but the number of harvests it can produce before the Jubilee. The focus on harvests ties the economic value directly to the land's productivity, which was crucial in an agrarian society. This perspective aligns with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>) and the understanding that God is the provider of all resources (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>).

The land itself never truly changed ownership; God declared, &#8220;The land is Mine, for you are strangers and sojourners with Me&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). So when someone &#8220;sold&#8221; land, he was really leasing its produce until the next Jubilee.<p>&#8226; The command prevents taking advantage of a neighbor. It aligns with &#8220;You are not to oppress one another&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/25-17.htm">Leviticus 25:17</a>) and echoes the broader call to honesty in commerce seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13&#8211;15</a>.<p>&#8226; By tying price to time, God protected both parties: the seller received fair value, and the buyer avoided overpaying for what would eventually revert.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In proportion to a greater number of years</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in proportion to a greater number of years&#8230;&#8221; clarifies how to calculate that fair value. The longer the span until the Jubilee, the more harvests the buyer will enjoy, so the higher the cost.<p>&#8226; This built-in sliding scale reflects justice similar to the daily-wage principle in <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-15</a>: compensation matches opportunity.<p>&#8226; It also teaches stewardship&#8212;recognizing future yield, planning ahead (<a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>), and honoring God&#8217;s timetable rather than personal gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or decrease it in proportion to a lesser number of years&#8230;&#8221; balances the previous statement. As Jubilee approaches, fewer harvests remain, so the price must drop.<p>&#8226; This mirrors God&#8217;s concern for the poor; a seller under financial strain would not be further burdened by an inflated price (see <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>).<p>&#8226; It embodies the &#8220;love your neighbor as yourself&#8221; ethic established in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and reaffirmed by Jesus in <a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he is selling you a given number of harvests</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for he is selling you a given number of harvests.&#8221; Here God explains the rationale: what is changing hands is not permanent land ownership but the right to reap its produce until Jubilee.<p>&#8226; The phrase keeps the arrangement agricultural and practical, tying worth to tangible yields (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-3</a> on debt release cycles).<p>&#8226; It underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over creation. Just as manna fell daily (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>), harvests belong to Him, and people manage them temporarily (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-16.htm">Leviticus 25:16</a> anchors land deals to Jubilee, ensuring righteous transactions. Price rises with more years and drops with fewer because only the upcoming harvests&#8212;not the land itself&#8212;are being transferred. The verse blends fairness, compassion, and acknowledgment that ultimate ownership rests with God, guiding His people to reflect His justice in every economic decision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">According to the multitude of years . . . and according to.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in proportion to the multitude of years </span>. . . <span class= "ital">and in proportion to, </span>as the words in the original here are not the same which are used in <a href="/leviticus/25-15.htm" title="According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:">Leviticus 25:15</a> and at the end of this verse, which are translated "according" in the Authorised Version.
