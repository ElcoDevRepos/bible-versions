This requirement underscores the necessity of approaching God through His appointed means. The priesthood, established through Aaron and his descendants, was integral to maintaining the covenant relationship. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who mediates the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion</b><br>The memorial portion signifies a representative part of the whole offering, symbolizing the entire sacrifice being presented to God. This act of taking a portion is reminiscent of the grain offerings, where a portion was burned, and the rest was consumed by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>). It highlights the importance of remembrance in worship, pointing to the need for continual acknowledgment of sin and reliance on God's provision.<p><b>and burn it on the altar</b><br>Burning on the altar signifies the complete dedication of the offering to God. The altar, central to the tabernacle and later the temple, was the place where sacrifices were made, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation with God. This act of burning represents purification and the transformation of the offering into a pleasing aroma to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p><b>atop the food offerings to the LORD</b><br>The placement atop the food offerings indicates the sin offering's connection to other sacrifices, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of worship and atonement. The food offerings, often associated with thanksgiving and fellowship, remind the worshiper of the need for a holistic approach to God, combining repentance with gratitude and communion.<p><b>it is a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was specifically for unintentional sins or acts of impurity, highlighting the pervasive nature of sin and the need for atonement. This offering points to the seriousness with which God views sin and the necessity of a sacrificial system to maintain holiness. Ultimately, it prefigures Christ's sacrifice, the perfect sin offering, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Leviticus 5:12 Mean</div><b>He is to bring it to the priest</b><p>When a worshiper realized he had sinned, God didn&#8217;t allow him to stay where he was&#8212;he had to move toward the tabernacle and personally hand his offering to the priest (<a href="/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5-6</a>; 1:3).<p>&#8226; The action underscored responsibility: sin can&#8217;t be managed from a distance.<p>&#8226; It also highlighted mediation: only a priest could lay the offering on the altar, prefiguring our Lord Jesus, &#8220;since we have a great High Priest&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming forward brought assurance that forgiveness was not guesswork; it was anchored in an ordained ritual (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion</b><p>The priest lifted a single handful&#8212;no more, no

does not forget the offering or the sinner who brings it (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The remainder was eaten by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16-18</a>), picturing fellowship restored.<p>&#8226; In Christ, the entire atonement is remembered at the Lord&#8217;s Table: &#8220;Do this in remembrance of Me&#8221; (<a

that consumed the daily burnt offering (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>; 9:24).<p>&#8226; Stacking the sin offering &#8220;atop&#8221; the ongoing sacrifices showed that all offerings shared one altar and one flame&#8212;pointing to one Savior (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The ascending smoke signaled acceptance: &#8220;It is a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The worshiper watched his sin symbolically rise and vanish, picturing <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm

turtledoves (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7, 11</a>), could find full atonement through this simple measure of flour.<p>&#8226; The category mattered more than the cost; forgiveness was accessible, yet still required shed blood at the altar that carried the burnt offerings (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, God &#8220;made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), the once-for-all sin offering that renders every other sacrifice unnecessary (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews
