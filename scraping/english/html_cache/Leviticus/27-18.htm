During this year, land that had been sold was to be returned to its original family owners. The act of consecrating a field refers to dedicating it to the Lord, often as a vow or offering. This phrase indicates a situation where the field is consecrated not during the Jubilee but afterward, which affects its valuation. The Jubilee concept underscores themes of redemption and rest, reflecting God's provision and sovereignty over the land.<p><b>the priest is to calculate the price</b><br>The priest's role in calculating the price highlights the religious and judicial authority vested in the priesthood. This calculation was necessary to determine the monetary equivalent of the field's value, which would be based on its potential yield until the next Jubilee. The involvement of the priest ensures that the process is fair and in accordance with divine law, emphasizing the integration of spiritual oversight in economic matters.<p><b>in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee</b><br>This phrase indicates that the valuation of the field is directly related to the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee. The fewer the years, the lower the valuation, as the field would soon revert to its original owner. This system ensured that the economic transactions were just and prevented the permanent loss of family inheritance. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and the temporary nature of earthly possessions.<p><b>so that your valuation will be reduced</b><br>The reduction in valuation serves as a practical application of the Jubilee's principles, ensuring that the consecration of the field is fair and equitable. This reduction acknowledges the diminishing time the consecrated field would be in the possession of the one who consecrated it. It also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of material wealth and the importance of aligning economic practices with God's laws. This principle can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers redemption and restoration, emphasizing the spiritual over the material.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in evaluating and determining the value of the field based on the years remaining until the next Jubilee.

Thus, for instance, if he vowed the field at the estimated value of fifty shekels twenty years after the jubile, the priest is only to reckon the thirty years which have to run to the next jubile, and is to deduct twenty shekels for the twenty years which have elapsed since the last jubile. Accordingly, the vower would only have to pay thirty shekels, exclusive of the fifth part above the estimated value.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/27-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
