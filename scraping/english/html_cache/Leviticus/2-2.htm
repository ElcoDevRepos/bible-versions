This phrase emphasizes the role of the priesthood in the sacrificial system, highlighting their responsibility to perform the rituals correctly. The priesthood was established in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>, where Aaron and his sons were consecrated for this sacred duty. This lineage underscores the importance of maintaining a holy and set-apart priesthood, which is a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil,</b><br>The act of taking a handful signifies the portion of the offering that is dedicated to God. Flour and oil were common elements in ancient Near Eastern offerings, symbolizing sustenance and the richness of life. The use of these elements in offerings reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where such produce was a staple. This act of taking a portion also foreshadows the concept of firstfruits, where the best of what one has is given to God.<p><b>together with all the frankincense,</b><br>Frankincense, a valuable resin, was used in worship for its fragrance and as a symbol of prayer rising to God. Its inclusion in the offering signifies the importance of a pleasing aroma, which is a recurring theme in sacrificial language. Frankincense was also one of the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>), symbolizing His priestly role and the sweet savor of His life and sacrifice.<p><b>and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar,</b><br>The burning of the offering on the altar serves as a memorial before God, a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The altar, central to the tabernacle and later the temple, was the place where sacrifices were made, symbolizing atonement and reconciliation. This act of burning signifies the transformation of the offering into something that ascends to God, akin to prayers and intercessions.<p><b>a food offering,</b><br>The term "food offering" indicates that the sacrifice is seen as a meal shared with God, symbolizing fellowship and communion. This concept is foundational in understanding the sacrificial system as a means of maintaining a relationship with God. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who referred to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering Himself for the sustenance of humanity.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD.</b><br>The idea of a "pleasing aroma" signifies God's acceptance of the offering. This phrase is used throughout the Old Testament to describe sacrifices that are offered with the right heart and intention. It points to the necessity of sincerity in worship and obedience. In the New Testament, Christ's sacrifice is described as a "fragrant offering" (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), fulfilling the typology of the Old Testament sacrifices and demonstrating the ultimate act of love and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons (Priests)</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, who were appointed as priests to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, performing sacrifices and rituals as mediators between God and the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where offerings and sacrifices were made to God.

The priest&#8217;s handful, mingled with all the frankincense and consumed by holy fire, rises as a pleasing aroma, assuring us that humble obedience and heartfelt worship are accepted&#8212;and ultimately fulfilled&#8212;in the perfect offering of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And he shall take.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the priest shall take from it a handful of its flour and of its oil with all its frankincense, and this shall he burn as its memorial upon the altar, </span>&c.<p><span class= "bld">Memorial.</span>--So called because it was designed to bring the worshipper into the grateful remembrance of God, and to remind him, as it were, of His promise to accept the service of His people rendered to Him in accordance with his command. Hence the declaration of the Psalmist, "the Lord <span class= "ital">remember </span>all thine offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice" (<a href="/psalms/20-4.htm" title="Grant you according to your own heart, and fulfill all your counsel.">Psalm 20:4</a>), and of the angel to Cornelius, "thy prayers and thy alms are come up for a memorial before God" (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm" title="And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God.">Acts 10:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - He shall take there out his handful. This was the task of the priest. The handful that he took and burnt upon the altar has the technical and significative name of the memorial. It acted as a memorial before God, in the same way as Cornelius's prayers and alms - "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God" (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>) - being something which should cause God to think graciously of the offerer. The frankincense is not mixed with the flour and the oil and the salt, as a constituent element of the offering, but is placed upon them, and is all of it burnt in "the memorial," symbolizing the need of adding prayer to sacrifice, that the latter may be acceptable to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1462;&#1492;&#1457;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(we&#183;h&#277;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
