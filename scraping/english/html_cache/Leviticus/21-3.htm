The mention of an "unmarried sister" highlights the familial responsibilities of a priest. In ancient Israel, family ties were crucial, and the priest had a duty to care for his immediate family. The unmarried sister, being without a husband, would rely on her brother for support and protection. This reflects the broader biblical principle of caring for widows and orphans, as seen in <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, emphasizing the importance of family and community support.<p><b>who is near to him</b><br>The phrase "near to him" indicates both physical proximity and relational closeness. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, family members often lived in close quarters, and the priest's responsibility extended to those within his immediate household. This nearness also implies a deeper emotional bond, underscoring the priest's obligation to his sister. The concept of being "near" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), highlighting the importance of close relationships within the faith community.<p><b>since she has no husband</b><br>The absence of a husband for the sister places her in a vulnerable position, as women in ancient Israelite society typically relied on male relatives for economic and social security. This provision in the law ensures that the priest can fulfill his familial duty without compromising his ritual purity. The protection of vulnerable family members is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting God's concern for justice and care for the marginalized. This can be seen in the laws regarding the protection of widows and orphans (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>) and is a type of Christ's care for His church, as He is described as the bridegroom who provides and cares for His bride, the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>, priests were set apart for service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

Verse 3 adds one more category&#8212;an unmarried sister&#8212;using the simple connector &#8220;or,&#8221; showing she belongs on the same short list of immediate family for whom mourning is permitted.<p>&#8226; This exception balances the priest&#8217;s call to ceremonial holiness with the fifth-commandment call to honor family (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/44-25.htm">Ezekiel 44:25</a> echoes the same list for future priests, underscoring that God consistently makes room for family care within priestly purity.<p>&#8226; By contrast, a Nazirite could not defile himself even for close kin (<a href="/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6-7</a>). The priestly allowance highlights God&#8217;s compassion toward those under a priest&#8217;s roof.<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers are likewise told to meet family obligations: &#8220;If anyone does not provide for his relatives&#8230; he has denied the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is near to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Near&#8221; points to physical proximity and covenant responsibility. The sister still lives in her father&#8217;s or brother&#8217;s household, so her death directly touches the priest&#8217;s daily life.<p>&#8226; Old Testament law often links nearness with duty of care. Boaz acted as a &#8220;near kinsman&#8221; for Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-12.htm">Ruth 3:12-13</a>), illustrating the same principle.<p>&#8226; Mourning for someone &#8220;near&#8221; maintains family solidarity while reminding Israel that holiness never cancels compassion (see <a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also prefigures Paul&#8217;s command that families first care for dependent widows so the church is not burdened (<a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since she has no husband</b><p>&#8226; The clause explains why this sister remains under her brother&#8217;s protection: without a husband she has no other legal provider.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly safeguards women in this situation (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Allowing the priest to mourn her death reinforces God&#8217;s heart for the vulnerable.<p>&#8226; Her singleness clarifies the limit: once she marries, care passes to her husband&#8217;s household, so a priest would no longer be permitted to defile himself for her (compare <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; In every age, God&#8217;s people are called to protect those who lack family covering (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/21-3.htm">Leviticus 21:3</a> widens the priestly mourning allowance to include an unmarried sister who still depends on her brother because she has no husband. God balances ceremonial purity with family duty, ensuring that holiness never hardens into indifference. The verse upholds care for the vulnerable, underscores household responsibility, and foreshadows New Testament commands to honor and support needy relatives&#8212;all while maintaining the priest&#8217;s unique call to represent a holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him</span>--That is, his maiden sister who still remains in sole relationship with him.
