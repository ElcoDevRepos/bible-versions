The priest's role in reexamination underscores the importance of spiritual oversight and discernment in matters of purity and impurity. This reflects the priestly duty to maintain holiness within the community, as seen in other priestly functions throughout Leviticus.<p><b>and if the mildew has spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather</b><br>Mildew, a form of mold, symbolizes corruption and decay, which can spread if not checked. The mention of various materials like fabric, weave, knit, or leather indicates the comprehensive nature of the law, covering all aspects of daily life. This reflects the thoroughness of God's law in addressing both spiritual and physical cleanliness. The spread of mildew can be seen as a metaphor for sin, which, if not addressed, can permeate and corrupt.<p><b>then regardless of how it is used</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the function or value of the item does not exempt it from the laws of purity. It highlights the principle that holiness and cleanliness are not contingent on utility or status but are absolute standards. This can be related to the New Testament teaching that all are equal before God, regardless of their role or function.<p><b>it is a harmful mildew</b><br>The term "harmful" indicates the potential danger and destructiveness of unchecked impurity. In a spiritual sense, this can be likened to sin, which is inherently harmful and separates individuals from God. The recognition of mildew as harmful underscores the need for vigilance and proactive measures to maintain purity.<p><b>the article is unclean</b><br>Declaring the article unclean signifies its separation from use within the community, reflecting the broader biblical theme of separation between the holy and the profane. This concept is foundational in Leviticus and is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be separate from sin. The idea of uncleanness also points to the need for redemption and cleansing, ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who cleanses from all sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>, the priest plays a crucial role as the one who examines and diagnoses skin diseases and other forms of uncleanness.
