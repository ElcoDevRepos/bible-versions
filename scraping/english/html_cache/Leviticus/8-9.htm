The turban, or mitre, was an essential part of the priestly garments described in <a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, serving as a symbol of holiness and authority. This act underscores the role of Moses as a mediator between God and the people, as he follows God's instructions to establish the priesthood. The turban represents the covering of the mind, indicating that the high priest's thoughts and actions should be aligned with God's will.<p><b>and set the gold plate, the holy diadem, on the front of the turban</b><br>The gold plate, also known as the holy diadem or the plate of pure gold, was inscribed with the words "Holy to the LORD" (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). This inscription served as a constant reminder of the high priest's dedication to God and the need for holiness in his service. The placement of the diadem on the front of the turban signifies the visibility and prominence of this dedication. The gold plate symbolizes purity and divine authority, reflecting the glory and majesty of God. It also prefigures the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect holiness and mediates between God and humanity.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands in the consecration process. Moses' adherence to God's instructions highlights the necessity of following divine guidance in worship and service. The phrase underscores the theme of obedience found throughout Leviticus, where the Israelites are called to live according to God's statutes. This obedience is a precursor to the New Testament teachings, where Jesus fulfills the law and calls His followers to live in accordance with His commandments (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The meticulous observance of God's commands in the consecration of Aaron and his sons sets a precedent for the priesthood and the worship practices of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
