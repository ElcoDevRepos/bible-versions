Fat was considered the best part of the animal, symbolizing richness and abundance. In the context of Leviticus, the fat was reserved for God, indicating that the best portions were to be given to Him. This act of removing the fat can be seen as a type of Christ, who offered Himself wholly and completely to God, holding nothing back. The removal of fat also signifies the separation of what is holy from what is common, a recurring theme in Leviticus. This practice underscores the importance of purity and dedication in worship.<p><b>and burn it on the altar</b><br>Burning the fat on the altar was an act of consecration and a pleasing aroma to the Lord, as described in other parts of Leviticus. The altar, located in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple, was the central place of sacrifice and worship for the Israelites. This act of burning symbolizes the complete surrender and dedication of the offering to God. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was wholly consumed in His obedience and love for the Father.
