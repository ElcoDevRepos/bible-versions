This presentation is a formal act of dedication and consecration, signifying the offering of the animal to God. The act of presenting the goat is a solemn ritual, emphasizing the seriousness of atonement and the need for a mediator between God and the people. The high priest, acting as the mediator, foreshadows the ultimate mediator, Jesus Christ, who presents Himself as the perfect sacrifice.<p><b>chosen by lot for the LORD</b><br>The use of lots to determine which goat is for the LORD underscores the belief in divine sovereignty and guidance. Casting lots was a common practice in ancient Israel to discern God's will, as seen in other biblical instances such as the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-24</a>) and the division of the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>). This method removes human bias, ensuring that the choice is divinely ordained. The chosen goat represents the substitutionary atonement, a type of Christ who was chosen by God to bear the sins of humanity.<p><b>and sacrifice it as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering is a critical component of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and purify the people and the sanctuary. The sacrifice of the goat signifies the transfer of sin from the people to the animal, which then bears the penalty of death. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, as the Lamb of God, takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The shedding of blood is necessary for atonement, as reiterated in <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the cost of reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, responsible for performing the rituals of atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_goat.htm">The Goat</a></b><br>One of two goats used in the Day of Atonement ritual; this goat is chosen by lot to be sacrificed as a sin offering to the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, to whom the sin offering is made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>An annual event in the Jewish calendar where the high priest makes atonement for the sins of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the rituals were performed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The sacrificial system underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.

(See <a href="/leviticus/16-15.htm" title="Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:">Leviticus 16:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - These verses might be translated as follows: - <span class="accented">And Aaron shall bring in the goat upon which the lot for the Lord fell, and shall offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, upon which fell the lot for a remover of sins, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to send him away for a remover of sins into the wilderness.</span> We are justified in inserting the words, "of sins," after "a remover," because "the use of the word <span class="accented">azal</span>, from which the word rendered by 'remover' is derived, is confined in the Hebrew dialect to the single purpose or institution which is here under consideration; so that this particular word must have conveyed to the mind of a Hebrew hearer or reader this notion of a removal of <span class="accented">sins</span>, and none other" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). The goat is both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord,</span> and subsequently (verse 20) offered to him, the priest laying his hands upon him and making a confession of the sins of the people. After he has thus become the Lord's, how could he be given up to Satan? The purpose of his being set apart <span class="cmt_word">is to make an atonement with him</span> (not <span class="accented">for him</span>, as some commentators explain it wrongly). As atonement was made by the blood of the sacrificed goat ceremonially covering sin, so it was also made by the live goat symbolically removing sin. But the atonement in both cases has reference to God. How could an atonement be made by an offering to Satan, unless Satan, not God, was the being whose wrath was to be propitiated, and with whom reconciliation was sought? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shall present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hiq&#183;r&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
