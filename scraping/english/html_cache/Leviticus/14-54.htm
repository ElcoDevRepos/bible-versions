It underscores the importance of following God's instructions precisely. In the context of Leviticus, the law serves as a guide for maintaining holiness and purity among God's people. The laws in Leviticus are part of the Mosaic Covenant, which was given to Moses on Mount Sinai. These laws were not only religious but also served practical purposes for health and community living.<p><b>for any infectious skin disease</b><br>Infectious skin diseases, often referred to as "leprosy" in biblical terms, were a significant concern in ancient Israel. The term covers a range of skin conditions, not just Hansen's disease (modern leprosy). The law provided a means to diagnose and manage these conditions to prevent the spread of disease and maintain ritual purity. The priests acted as health inspectors, which highlights the integration of spiritual and physical health in Israelite society. This reflects God's care for the holistic well-being of His people.<p><b>for a scaly outbreak</b><br>A "scaly outbreak" refers to specific symptoms that might indicate a contagious condition. The detailed descriptions in <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13 and 14</a> show the thoroughness required in examining such conditions. This attention to detail ensured that the community remained clean and that individuals were treated fairly. The process of examination and purification can be seen as a type of Christ's work in cleansing believers from sin, as He is the ultimate High Priest who purifies us from all unrighteousness (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites on how to live holy lives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the laws, who were to follow these instructions to maintain purity and holiness in their community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The individuals responsible for diagnosing and declaring someone clean or unclean, playing a crucial role in maintaining the community's spiritual and physical health.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/infectious_skin_disease.htm">Infectious Skin Disease</a></b><br>Refers to various skin conditions that could render a person ceremonially unclean, requiring examination and purification.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mildew.htm">Mildew</a></b><br>A type of mold or fungus that could affect clothing, houses, or other items, also requiring priestly inspection and cleansing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus emphasize the importance of holiness and purity in the life of God's people.

Earlier in the chapter the same wording appears (&#8220;This is the law of the one afflicted with a skin disease,&#8221; <a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>), reminding Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that every detail of life falls under God&#8217;s authority.<p>&#8226; The Lord consistently frames His statutes in this way (<a href="/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1&#8211;2</a>), reinforcing that obedience brings life and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; By stating &#8220;This is the law,&#8221; Scripture assures us these instructions are not cultural relics; they reveal God&#8217;s holy character, just as Jesus later affirmed that &#8220;not the smallest letter&#8221; of the Law will pass away until all is accomplished (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for any infectious skin disease</b><p>The verse immediately specifies the scope: it addresses &#8220;any infectious skin disease.&#8221; Earlier chapters describe how priests examined swelling, scabs, or discoloration to determine ritual status (<a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; These regulations provided public health safeguards long before modern medicine, yet they also carried a spiritual lesson: sin spreads like infection and must be dealt with thoroughly (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; When Jesus cleansed lepers (<a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12&#8211;19</a>), He fulfilled the mercy foreshadowed here, sending the healed men to the priest &#8220;as a testimony to them,&#8221; linking His work to the Law&#8217;s provision (<a href="/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The detailed inspections underscore God&#8217;s concern for every individual. Just as no lesion escaped priestly notice, no spiritual wound escapes the Lord&#8217;s eye (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a scaly outbreak</b><p>The phrase zooms in further: not only overt sores but even a &#8220;scaly outbreak&#8221; fell under the same law.<p>&#8226; Scripture already mentioned eruptions or &#8220;flaking of the skin&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/13-29.htm">Leviticus 13:29&#8211;37</a>). By repeating it here, God shows He cares about what seems minor as much as what is severe, a theme echoed when Jesus spoke of counting every hair (<a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest&#8217;s role was to distinguish between temporary irritation and serious uncleanness, reflecting God&#8217;s desire that His people discern between clean and unclean in all of life (<a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, even slight symptoms pointed forward to the far deeper cleansing provided by Christ, who &#8220;loved us and washed us from our sins in His blood&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-54.htm">Leviticus 14:54</a> may appear to be a simple concluding line, yet it carries weighty truth. &#8220;This is the law&#8221; grounds the instructions in God&#8217;s unchanging authority; &#8220;for any infectious skin disease&#8221; shows His comprehensive care for His people&#8217;s health and holiness; &#8220;for a scaly outbreak&#8221; reminds us that nothing is too small for His notice. Each clause affirms that God provides a way of diagnosis, separation, and ultimately restoration&#8212;beautifully fulfilled in the cleansing work of our Great High Priest, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54-56) <span class= "bld">This is the law for all manner of plague.</span>--These verses sum up the laws of leprosy given in Leviticus 13, 14.
