This act reflects the importance of cleanliness and holiness in worship, as seen in <a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>, where priests were required to wash before entering the tent of meeting. The washing signifies the need for internal purity, paralleling the New Testament call for believers to be cleansed from sin (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><b>and burned the entire ram on the altar</b><br>The burning of the entire ram signifies total consecration to God. Unlike other offerings where only parts were burned, the whole burnt offering represents complete surrender and dedication. This foreshadows Christ's total sacrifice on the cross, as He offered Himself wholly for humanity's redemption (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was one of the most common sacrifices, symbolizing atonement and devotion. It was a voluntary act of worship, expressing submission to God's will. This offering is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate burnt offering, fully consumed by the fire of God's judgment for our sins (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>a pleasing aroma</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice. It is a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>, <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>) and signifies divine satisfaction. In the New Testament, Christ's sacrifice is described similarly, as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), highlighting the fulfillment of the sacrificial system in Him.<p><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The term "food offering" emphasizes the idea of fellowship and communion with God. While God does not need physical sustenance, the offering symbolizes the spiritual nourishment and relationship between God and His people. This concept is fulfilled in the Lord's Supper, where believers partake in communion with Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>).<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's instructions. Moses' adherence to God's commands reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings were contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). It also points to Christ's perfect obedience to the Father, fulfilling the law on our behalf (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to deliver His laws.

That may sound like mere hygiene, yet it carries rich symbolism. In a burnt offering nothing can be offered to God while still defiled, even parts hidden from human eyes. <a href="/exodus/29-17.htm">Exodus 29:17</a> repeats the same step: &#8220;You are to cut the ram into pieces, wash the entrails and legs, and place them with its pieces and its head.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It highlights God&#8217;s insistence on inward as well as outward purity&#8212;<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> links &#8220;clean hands and a pure heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The priests who present the sacrifice will soon lay hands on it, so the washing reinforces that they must themselves be clean (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today the picture points to the cleansing Christ provides (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>) before we can serve Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and burned the entire ram on the altar as a burnt offering</b><p>A burnt offering (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>) is wholly consumed; nothing is retained for priest or worshiper.<p>&#8226; It speaks of total consecration&#8212;everything given to God with no part held back.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/1-13.htm">Leviticus 1:13</a>, &#8220;The priest shall then burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The ram&#8217;s skin is the only portion later assigned to the priest (<a href="/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>), underscoring how complete the surrender is.<p>&#8226; This foreshadows Christ&#8217;s self-giving on the cross, and <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> invites us to respond: &#8220;present your bodies as living sacrifices.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a pleasing aroma</b><p>Scripture repeatedly uses this phrase to note God&#8217;s acceptance&#8212;<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a> records, &#8220;When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The scent rising from the altar is a human way of expressing divine approval; God is Spirit, yet He chooses this image to assure worshipers their gift is received.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a> applies the language to Jesus: &#8220;Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God,&#8221; showing the ultimate fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><p>The burnt offering is classified as &#8220;food.&#8221; God, of course, needs no nourishment; the wording stresses that the altar is His table and the sacrifice belongs wholly to Him (<a href="/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a> calls the peace offering &#8220;food&#8221; too&#8212;various offerings together maintain God&#8217;s fellowship with His people.<p>&#8226; Jesus alludes to this idea when He says, &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>), showing that obedience itself satisfies God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><p>The verse ends by underscoring strict obedience. True worship is never freelance; it follows God&#8217;s revealed pattern.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a> notes, &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> reminds us, &#8220;To obey is better than sacrifice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes the principle: &#8220;If you love Me, keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). When Moses follows every detail, the people learn that God&#8217;s presence and blessing rest on submission to His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-21.htm">Leviticus 8:21</a> pictures complete, clean, and obedient surrender to God. The entrails and legs are washed, showing that nothing unclean may approach Him. The whole ram is laid on the altar, illustrating total devotion. Its rising aroma signals divine acceptance, and the designation &#8220;food&#8221; reminds us the offering belongs entirely to the LORD. Finally, the climactic note&#8212;Moses does it exactly as commanded&#8212;teaches that acceptable worship flows from humble obedience. In Christ the meaning is magnified: He is the once-for-all perfect burnt offering, calling us to live wholly consecrated lives in glad conformity to God&#8217;s word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He washed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#7717;a&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7364.htm">Strong's 7364: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wash, wash off or away, bathe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the entrails</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;qe&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
