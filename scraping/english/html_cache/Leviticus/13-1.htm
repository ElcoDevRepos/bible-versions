In the context of Leviticus, God is establishing a covenant relationship with Israel, providing them with guidelines for holiness and purity. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the covenant name of God, reminding the Israelites of His eternal presence and faithfulness.<p><b>said to Moses and Aaron</b><br>Moses and Aaron are central figures in the leadership of Israel. Moses, as the prophet and lawgiver, receives God's instructions, while Aaron, as the high priest, is responsible for implementing these laws, particularly those related to worship and ritual purity. This partnership underscores the importance of both prophetic and priestly roles in guiding the people.

The leprosy discussed in this and the following chapters consists of three general classes: viz., (1) leprosy of man (<a href="/context/leviticus/13-2.htm" title="When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:">Leviticus 13:2-46</a>); (2) leprosy of garments (<a href="/context/leviticus/13-47.htm" title="The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment;">Leviticus 13:47-59</a>); and (3) leprosy of houses (<a href="/context/leviticus/14-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 14:33-57</a>).<p><span class= "bld">When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh.</span>--In discussing the leprosy of man, the lawgiver enumerates six different circumstances under which it may develop itself. The first circumstance adduced in <a href="/context/leviticus/13-2.htm" title="When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:">Leviticus 13:2-6</a> is of its developing itself without an apparent cause. Hence it was enjoined that if anyone should notice in the skin of his flesh a rising or swelling, he should be taken to the priest. As the description of these symptoms is very concise, and requires to be specified more minutely for practical purposes, the spiritual guides of Israel, who had <span class= "ital">to </span>explain the law to the priests during the second Temple, and who came in personal contact with this distemper, defined them as follows :--<p><span class= "bld">A rising.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">a swelling, </span>or <span class= "ital">swollen spot.</span> . . . UNCLEANNESS DERIVED FROM LEPROSY OR CONTACT WITH LEPERS AND LEPROUS THINGS (chapters 13, 14). A third cause of uncleanness is found in a third class of offensive or repulsive objects. There is no disease which produces so foul an appearance in the human form as leprosy. There was, therefore, no disease so suitable for creating ceremonial, because representing spiritual, uncleanness. The name leprosy has been made to cover a number of diseases similar but not identical in character. There are many spurious forms of leprosy, and many diseases akin to leprosy which do not now come under discussion. The disease here dealt with is elephantiasis, especially in its anesthetic form, which is otherwise called white leprosy. The two varieties of elephantiasis - the tuberculated and the anesthetic - are, however, so closely connected together that they cannot be separated, the one. often running into the other. The first symptom of the malady is a painless spot, which covers an indolent ulcer. This ulcer may continue unprogressive for months or for years, during which the person affected is able to do his ordinary business; but at the end of these periods, whether longer or shorter, it produces a more repulsive and foul disfigurement of the human face and frame than any known disease, the features of the face changing their character, and part of the body occasionally mortifying and dropping off. Death at last comes suddenly, when a vital part of the body has been affected. The home of leprosy has in all ages been Syria and Egypt and the countries adjacent to them, but Europe has not escaped the scourge. In the Middle Ages, no European country was free from it; London had at one time six leper houses; cases were found not unfrequently in Scotland till the middle of the last century; and there was a death certified by medical science to have resulted from leprosy in the city of Norwich in the year 1880. The object of the regulations relating to leprosy is no more sanitary than of those relating to unclean meats. Like the latter, they may have served a sanitary purpose, for leprosy is, according to the prevailing medical opinion, slightly, though only slightly, contagious. Because leprosy was hideous and foul, it therefore made the man affected by it unclean, and before he could be restored to communion with God and his people, he must be certified by God's priest to be delivered from the disease. As in the previous cases, physical ugliness and defilement represent spiritual depravity and viciousness. "The Levitical law concerning leprosy reveals to us the true nature of sin. It shows its hideousness and its foulness, and fills us with shame, hatred, and loathing for it. And it reveals to us the inestimable benefit which we have received from the incarnation of the Son of God, 'the Sun of Righteousness, with healing in his wings' (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>); and fills us with joy, thankfulness, and love to him for his infinite goodness to us" (Wordsworth). Leprosy, the most loathsome of all common diseases, is the type and symbol of sin, and the ceremonial uncleanness attaching to it is a parable of the moral foulness of sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/13-1.htm">Leviticus 13:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 13:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 12:8"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 12:8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/13-2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 13:2"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 13:2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
