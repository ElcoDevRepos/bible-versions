It reflects the universal nature of God's holiness and the expectation that all within the community adhere to His standards. This inclusivity foreshadows the New Testament teaching that salvation through Christ is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>who eats anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts</b><br>The consumption of animals that died naturally or were killed by other animals was prohibited due to health concerns and ritual impurity. Such animals were not slaughtered according to the prescribed methods, making them unfit for consumption. This law underscores the importance of maintaining purity and avoiding defilement, which is a recurring theme in Leviticus. It also highlights the need for discernment in what is consumed, a principle echoed in the New Testament regarding spiritual and moral discernment (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9-10</a>).<p><b>must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><br>The requirement to wash clothes and bathe signifies a ritual cleansing process necessary to restore purity. Water is a symbol of purification throughout Scripture, pointing to the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>). This act of washing prefigures the baptismal rite in Christianity, symbolizing the washing away of sin and the believer's new life in Christ (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>).<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The state of uncleanness until evening indicates a temporary condition that can be remedied through prescribed actions. This reflects the concept of time-bound impurity, which contrasts with the eternal cleansing offered through Jesus' atonement. The evening marks a new day in the Jewish calendar, symbolizing renewal and the hope of restoration, akin to the new life believers have in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>then he will be clean</b><br>The transition from unclean to clean signifies restoration and acceptance back into the community. It illustrates God's provision for reconciliation and the importance of obedience to His commands. This cleansing process is a type of the ultimate cleansing from sin provided by Jesus, who makes believers clean through His blood (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).

As the body of the animal which either died a natural death, or has been torn by a wild beast, retains a great portion of its blood, it is forbidden to be eaten. The carcases, in which the blood has thus been coagulated in the veins and arteries, were given to the dogs (<a href="/exodus/22-31.htm" title="And you shall be holy men to me: neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.">Exodus 22:31</a>). The rigour with which this law was enforced may be seen from <a href="/context/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32-35</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/4-14.htm" title="Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.">Ezekiel 4:14</a>, Ezek. 46:36. According to the canonical law which obtained during the second Temple, the carcase was forbidden when the animal died a natural death, or met with an accident, or was strangled to death, or was torn by a wild beast. This explains the apostolic decision, in the council at Jerusalem, about "things strangled" (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm" title="But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.">Acts 15:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Whether it be one of your own country.</span>--The law was not only binding upon the native Israelite, but upon the proselyte. The mere stranger, in the strict sense of the word, who had not joined the Jewish community, was allowed to eat such carcases. (See <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm" title="You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - There is still another possible case. The blood of an animal may not have been shed, or not shed in such a way as to make it flow abundantly, as when the animal has died a natural death, or been killed by wild beasts. In this case, as the blood still remains in the body, the flesh may not be eaten without defilement. The defilement may be cleansed by the unclean man <span class="cmt_word">washing his clothes and bathing,</span> but if he neglect to do this, <span class="cmt_word">he shall bear his iniquity,</span> that is, undergo the consequence of his transgression, which he would not have undergone had he been ceremonially cleansed (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>; chapter Leviticus 11:39; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>). The prohibition of the eating of blood was continued by the Council of Jerusalem, but the observance of the regulation was no longer commanded as a duty binding on all men, but as a concession to Jewish feelings, enabling Jewish and Gentile converts to live together in comfort (see <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>;
