These birds were more affordable than larger animals like lambs or bulls, ensuring that even those with limited means could participate in the sacrificial system. This reflects God's inclusivity and compassion, allowing all Israelites to maintain a relationship with Him through atonement. The choice between turtledoves and pigeons also indicates flexibility in the law, accommodating the economic status of the individual. This principle of provision for the poor is echoed in the New Testament, where Mary and Joseph offer two turtledoves at Jesus' presentation in the temple (<a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>), underscoring their humble status.<p><b>one to be a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, designed to atone for unintentional sins and cleanse the individual from impurity. In <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>, this offering is part of the purification process for a person healed of a skin disease, symbolizing the removal of sin and restoration to the community. The sin offering points to the need for atonement and foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of bloodshed for forgiveness, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>and the other a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing the worshiper's total dedication and surrender to God. It was completely consumed by fire, representing the complete devotion and commitment of the individual to the Lord. In the context of <a href="/leviticus/14.htm">Leviticus 14</a>, the burnt offering follows the sin offering, signifying the worshiper's renewed relationship with God after being cleansed from impurity. This offering also prefigures Christ's complete and perfect sacrifice, as He offered Himself wholly to God on behalf of humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The burnt offering serves as a reminder of the call to live a life fully devoted to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in the purification process, acting as a mediator between the individual and God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cleansed_person.htm">The Cleansed Person</a></b><br>This refers to the individual who has been healed from a skin disease and is undergoing the purification process.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship where sacrifices and offerings are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/turtledoves_and_pigeons.htm">Turtledoves and Pigeons</a></b><br>These birds are used as offerings, representing the individual's repentance and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_offering_and_burnt_offering.htm">The Sin Offering and Burnt Offering</a></b><br>These offerings symbolize atonement for sin and complete surrender to God, respectively.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_all.htm">God's Provision for All</a></b><br>The allowance for turtledoves or pigeons shows God's understanding and provision for those of lesser means.

By allowing either turtledoves or young pigeons, the Lord shows compassionate accommodation for different economic situations (<a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>; <a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>). Both species were readily available in Israel, simple to handle, and already recognized in earlier sacrificial instructions (<a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14-17</a>). The choice underscores God&#8217;s consistent provision: no one is excluded from worship because of poverty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whichever he can afford</b><p>The phrase highlights God&#8217;s sensitivity to personal means. In the larger context (<a href="/leviticus/14-21.htm">Leviticus 14:21-22</a>), a three-tiered provision exists:<p>&#8226; If the healed leper is wealthy, he brings lambs (14:10-13).<p>&#8226; If moderately resourced, he brings one lamb plus two birds (14:21).<p>&#8226; If poor, he brings only birds (14:22).<p>This graded scale mirrors the earlier sin-offering options in <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7-13</a>. Scripture affirms that cleansing and fellowship with God are accessible to all, fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17-18</a>&#8217;s declaration that the Lord &#8220;shows no partiality.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one to be a sin offering</b><p>The sin offering (Hebrew, &#7717;a&#7789;&#7789;&#257;&#8217;&#7791;) dealt with impurity and guilt before God (<a href="/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20</a>). For the healed leper, it signified that the spiritual consequences of the disease were fully atoned. <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a> echoes the same principle: &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.&#8221; The bird&#8217;s blood was sprinkled on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/5-9.htm">Leviticus 5:9</a>), foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s shed blood that cleanses believers completely (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the other a burnt offering</b><p>The burnt offering (Hebrew, &#703;&#333;l&#257;h) symbolized total consecration; the entire bird was consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15-17</a>). After forgiveness, the worshiper devoted himself wholly to God&#8217;s service (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The sequence matters: first sin is addressed, then a life of dedication follows. In the New Testament, this order appears again&#8212;justification precedes sanctification (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>; 6:13).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-22.htm">Leviticus 14:22</a> shows God&#8217;s gracious provision for the poorest Israelite: two humble birds could secure both forgiveness (sin offering) and renewed devotion (burnt offering).
