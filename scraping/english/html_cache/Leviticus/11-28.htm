This law is part of the broader Levitical code, which outlines various purity laws for the Israelites. The emphasis on avoiding contact with dead animals underscores the importance of ritual purity and separation from death, which is seen as a result of sin. This reflects the holiness required by God and the need for the Israelites to be distinct from surrounding nations. The act of picking up a carcass could be necessary for practical reasons, such as removing it from a living area, but it still required purification.<p><b>must wash his clothes</b><br>Washing clothes was a common purification ritual in ancient Israel, symbolizing the removal of impurity. This act of washing is not just about physical cleanliness but also represents a spiritual cleansing. The requirement to wash clothes after touching a carcass highlights the seriousness of maintaining ritual purity. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament emphasis on inner purity and the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice, which washes away sin.<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The period of uncleanness lasting until evening reflects the daily cycle in Jewish thought, where a new day begins at sunset. This temporary state of uncleanness indicates that the impurity is not permanent but requires a period of separation and reflection. It also points to the grace of God, allowing for restoration and reintegration into the community after the appropriate purification steps are taken. This concept of temporary uncleanness can be seen as a type of the temporary nature of sin's hold on humanity, which is ultimately overcome through Christ.<p><b>They are unclean for you.</b><br>The phrase "They are unclean for you" emphasizes the specific covenant relationship between God and the Israelites. The dietary and purity laws set Israel apart as God's chosen people, distinct from other nations. This distinction is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is called to be holy as God is holy. The unclean animals and their carcasses serve as a constant reminder of the need for holiness and the separation from sin. In the New Testament, this separation is fulfilled in Christ, who makes believers holy and clean through His sacrifice, transcending the old covenant's ritual laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The primary human author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of cleanliness and uncleanliness were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>- The setting where the Israelites received the law, emphasizing their journey and dependence on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>- The focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, detailing which animals are permissible to eat and which are not.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>- The time by which a person who has become unclean is considered clean again, symbolizing a new beginning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus highlight the holiness of God and the need for His people to be set apart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_washing.htm">Symbolism of Washing</a></b><br>Washing clothes symbolizes the need for spiritual cleansing, pointing to the deeper need for purification from sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/temporary_vs._permanent_cleansing.htm">Temporary vs. Permanent Cleansing</a></b><br>The temporary nature of being unclean until evening foreshadows the permanent cleansing available through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_daily_life.htm">Holiness in Daily Life</a></b><br>The call to avoid uncleanliness reminds believers to pursue holiness in all aspects of life, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_christ.htm">Transformation through Christ</a></b><br>The fulfillment of the law in Christ invites believers to live in the freedom of grace, while still honoring the principles of holiness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_11_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 11:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_11_28_Clean_vs_Unclean_Guide.htm">How does Leviticus 11:28 guide us in distinguishing clean and unclean practices?

Touching the carcass creates ceremonial impurity (see <a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24</a> &#8211; 25; also compare <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a> for a similar principle with human remains). The focus is not on physical dirtiness alone but on maintaining a clear boundary between what the Lord declares clean and unclean (<a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25</a>). By highlighting the act of merely picking up the carcass, God underscores that uncleanliness can spread through contact, reminding Israel of His holiness and their need for constant vigilance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes</b><p>Cleansing was immediate and practical: wash the garments that had touched the carcass (<a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a> mirrors this requirement). Washing symbolized the removal of defilement, a visible step of obedience. It reinforced that holiness affected every part of life&#8212;even laundry. Other situations requiring the same action include bodily discharges (<a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>) and contact with a plague-house (<a href="/leviticus/14-47.htm">Leviticus 14:47</a>). The repeated pattern shows that God expected prompt responses to impurity, teaching Israel to value inner purity as much as outward cleanliness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><p>God set a specific, limited duration for the impurity: until the next sunset. This timeframe appears many times (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/15-7.htm">Leviticus 15:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>). The period allowed for reflection and reset, driving home that sin and defilement have consequences yet also pointing to God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;uncleanness was not permanent when handled His way. The evening marker placed the rhythm of cleansing into the daily cycle, weaving holiness into ordinary life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are unclean for you</b><p>By saying &#8220;for you,&#8221; God distinguishes Israel from surrounding nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>). He chose certain animals to symbolize moral and spiritual truths, teaching His people to discern (<a href="/leviticus/11-47.htm">Leviticus 11:47</a>). The statement also hints at a broader narrative fulfilled later: in <a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a> Peter initially calls unclean what God later declares clean, showing that these laws pointed forward to Christ&#8217;s ultimate purification (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>). Still, at the time of Leviticus, Israel&#8217;s obedience to these dietary boundaries demonstrated their covenant loyalty and testified to God&#8217;s holiness among the nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/11-28.htm">Leviticus 11:28</a> instructs Israel that even indirect contact with an unclean animal&#8217;s carcass spreads ceremonial impurity. The person must (1) acknowledge defilement by handling, (2) wash his clothes as an outward sign of cleansing, and (3) recognize a temporary state of uncleanness lasting until evening. All of this underscores God&#8217;s call for His people to be separate, holy, and attentive to His precise commands, anticipating the deeper cleansing later provided through Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">And he that beareth.</span>--This is simply <span class= "bld">a </span>resumption of <a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and anyone who picks up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;han&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#347;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
