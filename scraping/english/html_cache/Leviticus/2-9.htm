The "memorial portion" refers to a handful of the grain offering, which included fine flour, oil, and frankincense. This act of removing a portion signifies the offering's dedication to God. The grain offering, or "minchah," was a voluntary act of worship, expressing gratitude and devotion. It was distinct from animal sacrifices, emphasizing the fruits of human labor. This offering foreshadows Christ, who is the Bread of Life, symbolizing sustenance and provision.<p><b>and burn it on the altar</b><br>Burning the offering on the altar signifies complete dedication and surrender to God. The altar, central to Israelite worship, was a place of sacrifice and atonement. The act of burning represents purification and transformation, turning the offering into smoke that ascends to God. This process reflects the idea of offerings being consumed by divine fire, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the sacrifices of Elijah on Mount Carmel.<p><b>as a food offering</b><br>The term "food offering" indicates that the sacrifice is seen as a meal for God, symbolizing fellowship and communion. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, sharing a meal was a sign of peace and relationship. This offering underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God provides for His people, and they, in turn, offer back to Him. This concept is echoed in the New Testament through the Lord's Supper, where believers partake in communion with Christ.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a recurring motif in the sacrificial system, indicating God's acceptance of the offering. It suggests that the sacrifice, when offered with a sincere heart, is delightful to God. This imagery is used in the New Testament to describe Christ's sacrifice on the cross, which is described as a "fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The pleasing aroma signifies reconciliation and peace with God, achieved through obedience and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as prescribed in the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain_offering.htm">Grain Offering</a></b><br>A type of offering made to God, consisting of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices and offerings are made to God, representing His presence and the means of atonement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/memorial_portion.htm">Memorial Portion</a></b><br>A part of the grain offering that is burned on the altar, signifying remembrance and dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pleasing_aroma.htm">Pleasing Aroma</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating that the offering is acceptable and pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role as a mediator foreshadows Christ's ultimate priesthood, reminding us of the importance of intercession and mediation in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_grain_offering.htm">Symbolism of the Grain Offering</a></b><br>The grain offering represents dedication and thanksgiving.
