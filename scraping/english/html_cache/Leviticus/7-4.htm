The fat was seen as the best portion, reserved for God, indicating the offering of the best to the Lord. The kidneys, located near the loins, were thought to be the seat of emotion and moral decision-making in ancient Hebrew culture. This reflects the idea that God desires the deepest parts of our being, our innermost thoughts and intentions, to be dedicated to Him. The emphasis on the fat also points to the richness and abundance of God's provision and the need for the Israelites to acknowledge His sovereignty by offering the best parts back to Him.<p><b>and the lobe of the liver</b><br>The liver, particularly the lobe, was another significant part of the sacrificial animal. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the liver was often associated with divination and was considered a vital organ for life. Its inclusion in the sacrifice underscores the comprehensive nature of the offering, symbolizing the totality of life and the surrender of one's entire being to God. The removal of the liver's lobe for sacrifice may also signify the removal of sin and impurity, as the liver was thought to filter impurities from the blood. This act of offering the liver's lobe can be seen as a type of Christ, who offered Himself wholly and without blemish, purifying believers from sin.<p><b>which is to be removed with the kidneys</b><br>The removal of these specific parts for the sacrifice highlights the meticulous nature of the Levitical laws and the importance of obedience to God's commands. This detailed instruction reflects the holiness and perfection required in worship and sacrifice, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law perfectly. The act of removing these parts can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the separation of sin from the believer, as Christ's sacrifice removes the penalty and power of sin. The precision in these instructions emphasizes the need for careful adherence to God's word and the seriousness of approaching Him with reverence and purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>- The priests who were given specific instructions on how to perform sacrifices and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God who were given the laws to follow as part of their covenant with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence of God among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>- A type of sacrifice made to God, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrificial_details.htm">Understanding Sacrificial Details</a></b><br><a href="/leviticus/7-4.htm">Leviticus 7:4</a> emphasizes the importance of following God's instructions precisely.
