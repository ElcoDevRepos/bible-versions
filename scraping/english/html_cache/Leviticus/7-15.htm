The peace offering, also known as the fellowship offering, was a voluntary act of worship, expressing gratitude and thanksgiving to God. It was distinct from sin and guilt offerings, which were mandatory. The peace offering symbolized reconciliation and communion with God, and it was often shared between the offerer, the priests, and God. This communal aspect foreshadows the fellowship believers have with God through Jesus Christ, who is our peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>must be eaten on the day he offers it;</b><br>The requirement to eat the meat on the same day underscores the immediacy and sincerity of thanksgiving. It reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where preservation methods were limited, and freshness was valued. This immediacy also highlights the urgency of maintaining a right relationship with God, emphasizing that gratitude should be expressed promptly. In a broader theological sense, it points to the immediacy of God's provision and the need to respond to His blessings without delay.<p><b>none of it may be left until morning.</b><br>This command ensures that the offering remains a fresh and sincere act of worship, preventing any decay or corruption. It also signifies the completeness and sufficiency of God's provision, as there is no need to store leftovers for future use. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate and complete sacrifice, sufficient for all time (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The prohibition against leaving any until morning parallels the instructions for the Passover lamb (<a href="/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>), further connecting the peace offering to themes of deliverance and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and instructions for sacrifices were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offerings.htm">Peace Offerings</a></b><br>- A type of sacrifice in the Levitical system, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving.htm">Thanksgiving</a></b><br>- A specific type of peace offering expressing gratitude to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/immediate_gratitude.htm">Immediate Gratitude</a></b><br>The requirement to eat the offering on the same day underscores the importance of expressing gratitude promptly.

By laying a portion on the altar and sharing the rest as a meal, the offerer, the priests, and the Lord all participate together, portraying communion with God.<p>&#8226; Thanksgiving is at the heart of worship: &#8220;Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>). <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a> carries the principle forward: &#8220;Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because Christ is our ultimate peace offering (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>), every act of thanks now flows from His completed work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must be eaten on the day he offers it</b><p>&#8226; Immediate consumption underscores urgency and freshness. The fellowship meal is meant to be enjoyed in the same joyful moment the worshiper brings the sacrifice.<p>&#8226; The same principle appears in the Passover: &#8220;Do not leave any of it until morning&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-10.htm">Exodus 12:10</a>). God invites His people to experience deliverance and gratitude without delay.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, delaying gratitude dulls our sense of dependence. Second Corinthians 6:2 reminds us, &#8220;Now is the acceptable time.&#8221; We respond promptly to God&#8217;s grace and enjoy His presence today, not later.<p>&#8226; Practically, fresh meat guards against corruption in the ancient climate. God&#8217;s commands protect both worship and health.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>none of it may be left until morning</b><p>&#8226; Nothing left over means nothing withheld. The entire portion assigned to the worshiper must be enjoyed or disposed of that day&#8212;no hoarding, no profiting, no casual leftovers.<p>&#8226; This keeps the act purely worshipful. The offering cannot slide into a commercial resource or a mundane meal the next day (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-4.htm">1 Samuel 1:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The rule points ahead to Christ, whose body &#8220;did not see decay&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>). His sacrifice was complete&#8212;fully given, never diminished, never reused for lesser purposes.<p>&#8226; For believers, it urges wholehearted response. God invites us to consume the grace He supplies, rather than saving it for a more convenient moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a> teaches that a thanksgiving peace offering is a shared meal of grateful fellowship. Its meat must be eaten the same day&#8212;no delay, no leftovers&#8212;emphasizing immediacy, purity, and wholehearted response to God&#8217;s goodness. The regulation protects reverence, fosters joyful communion, and foreshadows the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, who calls us to receive and celebrate His grace without hesitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And the flesh of the sacrifice.</span>--That is, after the priest had the breast and the shoulder, the share of the victim which belongs to the offerer, together with the remaining loaves, he with his family and poor guests (see <a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11-18</a>) are to eat up before the morning, which at the time of the second Temple was limited to midnight.
