This could be a house, land, or other possessions. The act of consecrating a house indicates a dedication to God, often for religious purposes or as a vow. Redemption here implies the owner wishes to reclaim the house for personal use. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where something set apart or lost is restored. The concept of redemption is central to the Bible, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ.<p><b>he must add a fifth to the assessed value,</b><br>The requirement to add a fifth (20%) to the assessed value when redeeming a consecrated house underscores the seriousness of vows and dedications to God. This additional cost serves as a deterrent against making rash vows and emphasizes the sanctity of commitments made to God. The principle of adding a fifth is consistent with other Levitical laws concerning redemption, such as in <a href="/leviticus/25-27.htm">Leviticus 25:27</a>, where land redemption also requires an additional payment. This reflects God's justice and the importance of integrity in dealings with Him.<p><b>and it will belong to him.</b><br>Once the redemption process is completed, the house returns to the original owner. This provision ensures that while vows and dedications are taken seriously, there is also a path for restoration and return. This mirrors the biblical theme of restoration, where God provides a way for His people to return to Him despite their failings. The concept of belonging is significant, as it denotes ownership and responsibility, reminding believers of their ultimate belonging to God and His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as they were forming a covenant community under God's guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The central place of worship for the Israelites, where offerings and vows were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>- The mediators between God and the Israelites, responsible for overseeing the fulfillment of vows and offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows.htm">Vows</a></b><br>- Commitments made by individuals to dedicate something to God, which could include property, animals, or personal service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_vows.htm">The Sanctity of Vows</a></b><br>Vows made to God are sacred and should be taken seriously.
