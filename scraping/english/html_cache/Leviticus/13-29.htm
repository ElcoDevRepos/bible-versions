In ancient Israel, both men and women were subject to the same religious and ceremonial laws, emphasizing the communal responsibility to maintain purity and holiness. This equality before the law is consistent with the creation narrative in Genesis, where both male and female are made in the image of God.<p><b>has an infection</b><br>The term "infection" here refers to a skin disease, which in the context of Leviticus, often pertains to conditions that could render a person ceremonially unclean. The Hebrew word used can encompass a variety of skin ailments, not limited to what modern medicine would classify as leprosy. The concern was not only for physical health but also for maintaining ritual purity within the community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>, which uses physical ailments as a metaphor for spiritual corruption.<p><b>on the head or chin</b><br>The specific mention of the head or chin suggests a visible and potentially more severe form of skin disease, as these areas are prominent and difficult to conceal. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the head was often associated with leadership and authority, while the chin could symbolize speech and communication. An infection in these areas might symbolize a disruption in one's ability to lead or communicate effectively. This can be connected to the New Testament, where Jesus heals various diseases, demonstrating His authority over both physical and spiritual ailments (<a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>). The healing of such conditions by Jesus can be seen as a fulfillment of the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, where the Messiah is described as bearing our infirmities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests in ancient Israel were responsible for diagnosing and managing skin diseases, including infections on the head or chin, as part of their duties to maintain ritual purity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, to whom the laws of Leviticus were given, were expected to follow these guidelines to ensure community health and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the priests served and where the presence of God dwelled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_law.htm">Levitical Law</a></b><br>The body of laws given to the Israelites, including those concerning cleanliness and health, which are detailed in the book of Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_health.htm">Holiness and Health</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus highlight the connection between physical health and spiritual holiness.

The symptoms of leprosy are the same as before, except that the hairs in this case are of a reddish-yellow colour instead of white. The treatment is also the same, with the addition of shaving the head or beard except at the place where the suspicious spot has appeared. In verse 31 the priest is ordered to shut up (or bandage) the patient, if <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the spot be only in the upper cuticle, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is no black hair in it. <p>We should have expected rather from the second condition <span class="accented">if there be black hair in it</span>, or <span class="accented">if there be no yellow hair in it</span>; and Keil accordingly proposes to omit the negative or to change the word "black" for "yellow," the two words in the original being easily interchangeable. The present reading is. however. defensible. The fact of the spot being not below the cuticle was a very favorable symptom; there being no black hair was a very unfavourable symptom. Under these circumstances, the priest delays his judgment in the ordinary way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
