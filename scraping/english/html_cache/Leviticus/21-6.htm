Holiness here implies being set apart for divine service, reflecting God's own holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>). The priests, as mediators between God and the people, were to embody this holiness in their conduct and service. This requirement underscores the importance of purity and dedication in those who serve God, a principle echoed in the New Testament for all believers (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>and not profane the name of their God.</b><br>To profane means to treat something sacred with irreverence or disrespect. The priests were warned against actions that would dishonor God's name, as they represented Him to the people. This reflects the Third Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>) and highlights the seriousness of maintaining God's reputation. The concept of God's name being profaned is also addressed by the prophets, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a>, where Israel's actions among the nations brought dishonor to God's name.<p><b>Because they present to the LORD the food offerings,</b><br>The priests were responsible for offering sacrifices, which were central to Israel's worship and covenant relationship with God. These offerings, described in Leviticus chapters 1-7, included burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. Each had specific purposes and regulations, symbolizing atonement, thanksgiving, and fellowship with God. The priests' role in these offerings required them to be ritually pure and spiritually prepared.<p><b>the food of their God,</b><br>The term "food of their God" refers to the offerings made by fire, which were considered God's portion. While God does not need physical sustenance, these offerings symbolized the people's devotion and reliance on Him. The imagery of food highlights the relational aspect of the covenant, where God "consumes" the offerings as a sign of acceptance and favor. This concept is fulfilled in Christ, who is the ultimate offering and sustenance for believers (<a href="/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>).<p><b>they must be holy.</b><br>The repetition of the call to holiness emphasizes its critical importance. The priests' holiness was not only for their own sake but for the sake of the entire community, as they facilitated the people's access to God. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that all believers are a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), called to live holy lives as representatives of Christ in the world. The ultimate fulfillment of holiness is found in Jesus, the perfect High Priest, who sanctifies His people (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of this verse is on the priests, who are called to maintain a standard of holiness due to their role in presenting offerings to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the relationship between the priests and God, highlighting the need for holiness in service to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>These are the sacrifices that the priests present to God, which are considered sacred and require the priests to be holy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>While not mentioned directly in this verse, the Tabernacle is the place where these offerings are made, representing God's dwelling among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holiness.htm">Holiness</a></b><br>A central theme in this verse, holiness is the state of being set apart for God, which the priests must embody.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_holiness.htm">The Call to Holiness</a></b><br>Just as the priests were called to be holy, all believers are called to live lives set apart for God.

It touches everything from their marriages to their mourning (<a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-5</a>).
