Unlike other tribes, they were not given a large contiguous territory but were instead allocated specific cities throughout Israel (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). These cities served as their dwelling places and centers for their priestly functions. The distribution of these cities ensured that the Levites were spread throughout the land, facilitating their role as spiritual leaders and teachers of the Law.<p><b>the Levites always have the right to redeem</b><br>The concept of redemption in the Old Testament often involves the reclaiming or buying back of property or persons. For the Levites, who did not have a large inheritance of land, the ability to redeem their houses was crucial for maintaining their presence and function within their cities. This provision underscores the importance of the Levites' role and ensures their stability and continuity in serving the community. The right of redemption reflects God's provision and care for those dedicated to His service.<p><b>their houses in the cities they possess</b><br>The houses in the Levitical cities were not just residences but also places where the Levites could perform their duties, including teaching the Law and offering counsel. The possession of these houses was vital for the Levites to fulfill their God-given responsibilities. This provision highlights the unique status of the Levites, who, unlike other Israelites, did not possess agricultural land but were instead supported by the tithes and offerings of the people (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). The ability to redeem their houses ensured that the Levites could maintain their homes and continue their ministry without disruption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

These cities formed spiritual way-stations, ensuring worship and instruction were never far away (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). By beginning the verse with &#8220;As for the cities of the Levites,&#8221; Scripture reminds us that these towns were not an afterthought but a deliberate gift, anchoring the nation&#8217;s worship to everyday life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Levites always have the right</b><p>Unlike other Israelites&#8212;whose houses in walled cities could be bought back only within one year (<a href="/leviticus/25-29.htm">Leviticus 25:29-30</a>)&#8212;the Levites had a perpetual right of redemption. The word &#8220;always&#8221; underscores a standing promise, reflecting God&#8217;s unchanging faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>). Their ministry was continual (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>), so their ability to reclaim property had to be continual as well. This safeguard protected their calling from the pressures of debt or misfortune and mirrored the redeeming character of the Lord Himself (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to redeem their houses</b><p>Redeeming a house meant paying the price to recover what had been lost. In the Levites&#8217; case, it prevented any permanent alienation from their dwellings.<p>&#8226; It kept their families near the sanctuary duties (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>).<p>&#8226; It preserved God&#8217;s provision for those who &#8220;have no inheritance among the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadowed the ultimate Redeemer who would buy back His people forever (<a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<p>Thus every time a Levite exercised this right, Israel saw a living illustration of divine redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the cities they possess</b><p>Though the Levites owned no broad territory, these cities were legally theirs (<a href="/joshua/21-41.htm">Joshua 21:41-42</a>). &#8220;Possess&#8221; highlights genuine ownership, not a temporary loan. The arrangement balanced two truths:<p>&#8226; God owns the whole land (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God still provides tangible security for His servants (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>).<p>Because the Levites&#8217; homes were secure, they could serve without distraction, and the surrounding tribes benefited from accessible priests and teachers (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm">Leviticus 25:32</a> safeguards the Levites&#8217; cities, gives them an endless right to buy back their houses, and guarantees stable homes within their priestly towns.

They constituted the share of the national property which was assigned to the tribe of Levi, and so far stood in the same relation to them as the land did to the other tribes. They therefore returned to the original possessor or his representative in the year of jubilee, and might at any earlier time be redeemed. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,</span> should rather be rendered, <span class="accented">But in respect to the cities of the Levites.</span> There is a difficulty also as to the translation of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">And if a man purchase of the Levites,</span> for the word rendered <span class="accented">purchase</span> menus elsewhere <span class="accented">redeem</span>; but here the Authorized Version would seem to be correct. The sense that it gives is that if any one bought a house of the Levites, he had to render it back in the year of jubilee, just as though it had been land. On the other hand, the land belonging to the Levites, in the suburbs of the Levitical cities, which was used for the pasturage of the flocks of the Levites, could not be sold except to a Levite, and therefore no question between the Levites and members of the other tribes could arise regarding it.
