The Israelites were a covenant people, and lineage was important for identity and inheritance. The mention of an Egyptian father suggests a connection to the period of slavery in Egypt, as many Israelites had intermarried with Egyptians during their time there. This mixed heritage may have contributed to tensions within the community, as purity of lineage was often emphasized in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2-8</a>).<p><b>went out among the Israelites</b><br>The phrase indicates that the individual was living among the Israelites, suggesting some level of acceptance or integration into the community. However, his mixed parentage might have made him an outsider in certain respects. This situation reflects the broader theme of inclusion and exclusion within the covenant community, which is addressed in various parts of the Old Testament (e.g., Ruth, who was a Moabite, yet became part of the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus).<p><b>and a fight broke out in the camp</b><br>The camp refers to the encampment of the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This setting is significant as it was a place where the Israelites were learning to live under God's law. The fight indicates a disruption of the peace and order that the law was intended to maintain. Conflicts within the camp were serious matters, as they could threaten the unity and holiness of the community.<p><b>between him and an Israelite</b><br>This detail emphasizes the conflict between someone of mixed heritage and a full Israelite, possibly highlighting underlying tensions related to identity and belonging. The distinction made here may reflect broader societal issues of acceptance and the challenges faced by those who were not fully part of the covenant community. This incident foreshadows later discussions in the New Testament about the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_an_israelite_woman_and_an_egyptian_father.htm">The Son of an Israelite Woman and an Egyptian Father</a></b><br>This individual is central to the event in <a href="/leviticus/24-10.htm">Leviticus 24:10</a>.

The verse reminds us that covenant privilege demands covenant obedience, that unresolved conflict imperils communal holiness, and that inner loyalties&#8212;whether divided or devoted&#8212;will eventually show themselves in word and deed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian.</span>--The name of the Israelitish woman, whose son is the subject of the narrative before us, we are afterwards told was Shelomith. She had married an Egyptian whilst she and her people were still in Egypt. Though the father's nationality is here expressly given, yet from the fact that he does not personally come before us in this incident, it is evident that he remained in Egypt, whilst the son was of the "mixed multitude" who followed the Israelites in their exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm" title="And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.">Exodus 12:38</a>). This incident, therefore, which is so difficult satisfactorily to connect with the preceding legislation, brings before us a picture of the camp-life of the Israelites in the wilderness. According to tradition, the father of this blasphemer was the taskmaster under whom Shelomith's husband worked in Egypt, that he had injured Shelomith and then smote her husband, that this was the Egyptian whom Moses slew (<a href="/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a>) for the injuries he had thus inflicted both upon the Hebrew and his wife, and that the culprit before us is the issue of the outraged Shelomith by the slain Egyptian. This will explain the rendering here of the ancient Chaldee version, "A wicked man, a rebel against the God of heaven, had come out of Egypt, the son of the Egyptian who slew an Israelite in Egypt, and outraged his wife, who conceived, and brought forth this son among the children of Israel."<p><span class= "bld">Went out among the children of Israel.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">he went out into the midst, </span>&c. This shows that he lived outside the camp and came where he had no right to be.<p><span class= "bld">This son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together.</span>--The cause and the manner of their quarrel or contention are not given. But. according to tradition, the "man of Israel" was a Danite, and, as we are told in the next verse, his mother was of the tribe of Dan, this semi-Egyptian contended with this Danite that he had a right from the side of his mother to encamp among the children of Dan, whilst the Danite disputed this, maintaining that a son could only pitch his tent by the standard of his father's name (<a href="/numbers/2-2.htm" title="Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.">Numbers 2:2</a>). This contention, moreover, took place before the rulers who tried the case (<a href="/context/exodus/19-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.">Exodus 19:21-22</a>). Hence the ancient Chaldee version translates it, "And while the Israelites were dwelling in the wilderness, he sought to pitch his tent in the midst of the tribe of the children of Dan; but they would not let him, because, according to the order of Israel, every man, according to his order, dwelt with his family by the ensign of his father's house. And they strove together in the camp. Whereupon the son of the Israelitish woman and the man of Israel who was of the tribe of Dan went into the house of judgment."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The son of an Israelitish woman.</span> This is the only place where the adjective <span class="accented">Israelitish</span> is found; and the word "Israelite" only occurs in <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whose father was an Egyptian.</span> The man could not, therefore, be a member of the congregation, as, according to the subsequently promulgated law (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a>), the descendant of an Egyptian could not be admitted till the third generation.

First, he <span class="cmt_word">went out among the children of Israel</span>, that is, he did not confine himself to his own part of the encampment, where the mixed multitude lived, but he intruded into the part set aside for pure Israelites;
