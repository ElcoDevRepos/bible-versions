The prohibition against sexual relations with a mother's sister is a specific application of the broader principle of avoiding incestuous relationships. In the ancient Near Eastern context, family structures were central to societal stability, and such prohibitions helped preserve family integrity and prevent relational chaos. This command reflects God's desire for His people to live distinctively from surrounding nations, many of which practiced various forms of sexual immorality. The New Testament reiterates the importance of sexual purity in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, emphasizing that believers' bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>for she is your mother&#8217;s close relative</b><br>The phrase highlights the closeness of the familial relationship, underscoring the importance of respecting family boundaries. In ancient Israel, family ties were not only biological but also social and economic, forming the foundation of community life. The term "close relative" indicates a kinship bond that should be honored and protected. This respect for family relationships is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to treat one another with love and honor, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>. The emphasis on family integrity can also be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and exemplified love and respect within His earthly family and the broader family of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom these laws were given to set them apart from other nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people practicing detestable customs that God wanted His people to avoid.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_relationships.htm">Holiness in Relationships</a></b><br>God calls His people to maintain purity in familial relationships, reflecting His holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_family_boundaries.htm">Respect for Family Boundaries</a></b><br>The law underscores the importance of respecting family boundaries, which preserves the integrity and sanctity of the family unit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_distinction.htm">Cultural Distinction</a></b><br>By adhering to these laws, the Israelites were to be distinct from the surrounding nations, serving as a witness to God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/moral_integrity.htm">Moral Integrity</a></b><br>Christians today are called to uphold moral integrity, avoiding practices that compromise their witness and relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands, even when culturally challenging, is a demonstration of our love and commitment to Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_13_Respect_family_limits.htm">How does Leviticus 18:13 emphasize the importance of respecting family boundaries today?

The law which obtained in the time of Christ also defines this prohibition to extend to a mother's sister or half-sister by the same father or mother, whether born in wedlock or out of it. It is remarkable that the administrators of the law during the second Temple understood this last prohibition strictly to apply to alliances between nephews and aunts, but not <span class= "ital">vice versa </span>to marriages between nieces and uncles. They regarded intermarriage between uncle and niece as an especially meritorious act, and interpreted the promises "then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer" (<a href="/isaiah/58-9.htm" title="Then shall you call, and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If you take away from the middle of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;">Isaiah 58:9</a>) to refer more particularly to the man "who loves his neighbours, befriends his relations, <span class= "ital">marries his brother's daughter, </span>and lends money to the poor in the hour of need." This is in accordance with the fact that not only do we find that Nahor married Milcah the daughter of his brother Haran(<a href="/genesis/11-29.htm" title="And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.">Genesis 11:29</a>), but that Othniel, the son of Kenaz, married his niece Achsah, being the daughter of Caleb, his father's brother (<a href="/joshua/15-17.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Joshua 15:17</a>; <a href="/judges/1-13.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Judges 1:13</a>). Hence among the Jews to this day intermarriages between uncles and nieces is of common occurrence.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have sexual relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;er&#183;wa&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6172.htm">Strong's 6172: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nakedness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your mother&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
