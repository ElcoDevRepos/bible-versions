The consumption of the meat was to occur within a specific timeframe, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands. Eating the meat on the third day violated the sanctity of the offering, reflecting a disregard for divine instructions. This regulation underscores the principle of holiness and the need for purity in worship practices.<p><b>it will not be accepted</b><br>The rejection of the offering if consumed on the third day highlights the importance of adhering to God's laws. Acceptance by God was contingent upon obedience, and deviation from His commands rendered the offering void. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice. The emphasis is on the heart's posture and the sincerity of worship rather than mere ritualistic compliance.<p><b>It will not be credited to the one who presented it</b><br>The lack of credit for the offering signifies that the act of worship was incomplete and unacceptable. In the context of ancient Israel, offerings were a means of maintaining a covenant relationship with God. The failure to follow God's instructions meant that the intended purpose of the offering&#8212;to bring peace and fellowship with God&#8212;was not achieved. This serves as a reminder of the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will to receive His blessings.<p><b>it shall be an abomination</b><br>The term "abomination" indicates something detestable or repulsive to God. In the Hebrew context, this word is often used to describe actions that are morally or ritually impure. The strong language underscores the severity of the offense and the need for reverence in worship. This concept is seen throughout the Old Testament, where certain practices are deemed abominable due to their incompatibility with God's holiness.<p><b>and the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity</b><br>Bearing one's iniquity implies personal responsibility for sin. In the sacrificial system, the consequences of disobedience were often immediate and severe. This phrase indicates that the individual who disregards God's command would face the repercussions of their actions. It reflects the broader biblical theme of accountability before God, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, where each person is responsible for their own sin. This principle points to the need for repentance and the seriousness of maintaining a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the peace offering to God, seeking fellowship and communion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who performs the sacrificial rites and ensures the offerings are made according to God's commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peace_offering.htm">The Peace Offering</a></b><br>A voluntary sacrifice made to express gratitude, fulfill a vow, or seek fellowship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where offerings were made, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_day.htm">The Third Day</a></b><br>A specific time frame indicating the limit for consuming the peace offering, emphasizing obedience and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_over_ritual.htm">Obedience Over Ritual</a></b><br>The regulation of consuming the peace offering within a specific time frame underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands over mere ritualistic practices.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_worship.htm">Holiness in Worship</a></b><br>The requirement for the offering to remain pure reflects the need for holiness in our worship and daily lives.
