The act of skinning the animal was a meticulous process, symbolizing the removal of the outer layer to expose what is beneath, which can be seen as a metaphor for repentance and the stripping away of sin. This process was performed by the offerer, indicating personal involvement in the sacrificial act. The skin of the animal was given to the priest as part of their provision (<a href="/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>), highlighting the support of the priesthood through the offerings of the people.<p><b>and cut it into pieces.</b><br>The cutting of the offering into pieces was a detailed and deliberate act, ensuring that the sacrifice was prepared according to God's instructions. This process allowed for the entire animal to be consumed by fire, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. The division into parts can also be seen as a type of Christ, whose body was broken for humanity (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>). Each piece of the offering was arranged on the altar, signifying order and completeness in worship.
