These laws served to set Israel apart from other nations, emphasizing holiness and obedience to God. The prohibition against eating certain meats is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the importance of purity and separation from pagan practices. In the New Testament, Jesus declares all foods clean (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>), symbolizing the new covenant and the inclusion of Gentiles into God's people.<p><b>or touch their carcasses;</b><br>Touching the carcasses of unclean animals rendered a person ceremonially unclean, requiring purification rituals. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where contact with death or impurity necessitates cleansing. The emphasis on avoiding defilement underscores the need for spiritual purity and the separation from sin. In the New Testament, the concept of spiritual cleanliness is expanded, with believers called to be holy in all conduct (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>they are unclean for you.</b><br>The designation of certain animals as unclean is a divine ordinance, not based on health or hygiene, but on God's sovereign choice. This distinction teaches the Israelites about the nature of sin and the need for discernment in their daily lives. The unclean animals symbolize spiritual impurity, reminding the Israelites of their call to be a holy nation. In the New Testament, the focus shifts from external observance to internal purity, with Jesus emphasizing the importance of the heart (<a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The primary human author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of clean and unclean animals were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including dietary laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>Categories of animals defined by God, distinguishing what the Israelites could and could not eat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received these laws during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The dietary laws were a means to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.

Through these tangible rules, God taught His people constant obedience, underscored the seriousness of sin&#8217;s defilement, and set Israel apart as His holy nation. Though Christ has fulfilled the ceremonial law and declared all foods clean, the passage still urges believers to honor God with their bodies, avoid spiritual contamination, and embrace a lifestyle that reflects His holiness in every detail of daily life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Of their flesh ye shall not eat.</span>--During the second Temple the prohibition was defined to extend to the smallest quantity.
