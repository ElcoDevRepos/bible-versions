The cultural and historical context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on family lineage and inheritance. Marrying a brother's wife was generally forbidden, except in the case of levirate marriage, where a brother was required to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in his brother's name (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). This law in Leviticus, however, refers to a situation where the brother is still alive, thus making the act unlawful. This prohibition underscores the importance of maintaining family boundaries and the sanctity of marriage.<p><b>it is an act of impurity</b><br>The term "impurity" in this context refers to a violation of God's holiness standards. In the Levitical code, impurity often relates to actions that defile a person spiritually and ceremonially. This act is considered a moral transgression that disrupts the order established by God for familial relationships. The concept of impurity is significant throughout Leviticus, as it delineates what is clean and unclean, impacting one's ability to participate in community worship and fellowship with God.<p><b>He has uncovered the nakedness of his brother</b><br>This phrase uses a euphemism common in biblical language to describe sexual relations. "Uncovering nakedness" is a term that appears frequently in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18 and 20</a>, referring to illicit sexual acts. The act of uncovering a brother's nakedness by marrying his wife while he is still alive is seen as a profound violation of familial loyalty and respect. This phrase highlights the seriousness of the offense, as it not only affects the individuals involved but also dishonors the family unit.<p><b>they shall be childless</b><br>The consequence of being childless is both a literal and a symbolic punishment. In ancient Israel, having children was considered a blessing and a sign of God's favor (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). Childlessness, therefore, was seen as a curse or a divine judgment. This punishment serves as a deterrent against violating God's commandments and emphasizes the importance of obedience to His laws. Theologically, it reflects the principle that sin leads to loss and barrenness, contrasting with the fruitfulness that comes from living in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which had practices that God wanted them to avoid, including those related to marriage and family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother's_wife.htm">Brother's Wife</a></b><br>The specific relationship mentioned in this verse, highlighting the importance of family integrity and purity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate lawgiver, whose holiness and standards are reflected in the laws given to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_holiness.htm">Understanding God's Holiness</a></b><br>God's laws reflect His holy nature and His desire for His people to be set apart from the surrounding nations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_family_integrity.htm">The Importance of Family Integrity</a></b><br>The prohibition against marrying a brother's wife underscores the value God places on family relationships and the need to honor them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The warning of childlessness serves as a reminder that disobedience to God's commands can lead to serious consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contextual_application.htm">Contextual Application</a></b><br>While the specific law may not apply directly today, the principle of maintaining purity and honoring family relationships remains relevant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respecting_god's_design_for_marriage.htm">Respecting God's Design for Marriage</a></b><br>This passage encourages believers to respect and uphold God's design for marriage as a sacred covenant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_20_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 20:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_20_21_Respect_family_limits.htm">How does Leviticus 20:21 emphasize the importance of respecting familial boundaries today?
