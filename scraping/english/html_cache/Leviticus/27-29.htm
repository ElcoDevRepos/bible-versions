In the ancient Near Eastern context, such devotion was a common practice, where certain people or things were irrevocably given over to God, often as a form of divine judgment. This concept is seen in the story of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>), where everything in the city was devoted to destruction. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the holiness of God, who demands justice.<p><b>may be ransomed;</b><br>The idea of ransom involves the payment required to redeem or buy back something or someone. In the broader biblical narrative, ransom is a significant theme, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). However, in this specific context, the text emphasizes that certain individuals, once devoted to destruction, cannot be redeemed or bought back. This highlights the irrevocable nature of certain divine decrees and the finality of God's judgment.<p><b>he must surely be put to death.</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and inevitability of the judgment pronounced. In the historical context of ancient Israel, capital punishment was a means of maintaining the holiness and purity of the community. Theologically, it points to the ultimate consequence of sin, which is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). This also foreshadows the necessity of Christ's sacrificial death, as He took upon Himself the judgment that humanity deserved, providing a way for redemption and life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, forming the covenant community of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The place where God gave the Law to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The divine lawgiver who established the covenant with Israel and provided the laws for holy living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows_and_devotions.htm">Vows and Devotions</a></b><br>- The context of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, which deals with vows made to God and the rules surrounding them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The verse underscores the gravity of sin and the holiness of God.

The verse upholds God&#8217;s unwavering holiness, the gravity of sin, and our need for a perfect substitute. In Israel&#8217;s theocracy, that meant irreversible capital judgment. In the broader biblical story, it points to the cross, where the only effective ransom was paid by Jesus, satisfying the very justice this verse announces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Every one banned, which shall be banned of men, </span>that is, every one banned from amongst men, or every human being banned, is not to be redeemed. Like the cattle and the patrimonial estates, when once devoted to God by a vow of banning, the man thus banned by a vow comes irretrievably under the class of "most holy unto the Lord," or one irrevocably withdrawn from the power of man.<p><span class= "bld">But shall surely be put to death.</span>--Not as a sacrifice to God, but, on the contrary, to be removed out of His sight. This is the apparent import of the passage, and seems to be confirmed by the melancholy narrative of Jephtha and his daughter (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm" title="And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,">Judges 11:30</a>). This seems to have been the interpretation put on the law in question during the second Temple, since it is embodied in the Chaldee Versions, which render the verse as follows: "Every vow that shall be vowed of man, shall not be redeemed with money, but with burnt offerings and with hallowed victims, and with supplications for mercy before the Lord, because such are to be put to death." It is, however, supposed that this Awful vow of banning could only be exercised on notorious malefactors and idolaters as dangerous to the faith of the Israelites, that it could not be made by any private individual on his own responsibility, and that when such cases occurred the community or the Sanhedrin carried out the ban as an act of judicial necessity, thus showing it to be "most holy unto the Lord." Accordingly, <a href="/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28-29</a> treat of two different cases. The former regulates objects "banned unto the Lord," which differs from the vow of dedication discussed in <a href="/context/leviticus/27-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.">Leviticus 27:2-8</a> only in so far that it is unredeemable, whilst <a href="/leviticus/27-29.htm" title="None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
