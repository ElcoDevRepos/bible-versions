The term "teeming life" refers to the abundance and diversity of aquatic creatures. The word "detestable" indicates a strong prohibition, suggesting that these creatures are not merely to be avoided but are considered abominable. This reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, where God sets apart His people by distinguishing between clean and unclean. The concept of detestability is tied to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing purity and separation from pagan practices.<p><b>everything in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales.</b><br>This phrase specifies the criteria for aquatic creatures that are considered clean or unclean. Fins and scales are the distinguishing features that determine whether a creature is permissible to eat. This distinction may have practical health reasons, as fish with fins and scales are generally less likely to carry parasites. However, the primary focus is on ritual purity and obedience to God's commands. The seas and streams represent the natural habitats of these creatures, and the Israelites are called to discern and obey God's laws in all aspects of life. This command is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-9.htm">Deuteronomy 14:9-10</a>, reinforcing its importance. The requirement for fins and scales can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual discernment, encouraging believers to seek what is pure and holy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of clean and unclean animals were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_and_rivers.htm">The Sea and Rivers</a></b><br>Natural bodies of water mentioned as habitats for aquatic creatures, some of which are deemed unclean.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>A classification system given by God to the Israelites to distinguish between what is permissible and impermissible to eat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law, emphasizing their need for guidance and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>The dietary laws were given to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.
