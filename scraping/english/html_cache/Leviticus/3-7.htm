Lambs were commonly used in sacrificial practices due to their availability and significance in pastoral societies. The lamb is a symbol of innocence and purity, often representing the ideal sacrifice. This foreshadows Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, highlighting His role as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>he must present it</b><br>The act of presenting the offering emphasizes the personal involvement and responsibility of the worshiper. It is not merely a ritualistic act but a demonstration of devotion and obedience to God. This presentation is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of offering oneself as a living sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are called to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the sacredness of the act and the presence of God in the sacrificial process. It underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the worship and offerings of His people. This concept is echoed throughout Scripture, where the presence of God is central to worship, such as in the tabernacle and later the temple. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who, through His sacrifice, brings believers into the presence of God, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the lamb as a peace offering.
