The "remainder" refers to the portion of the grain offering not burned on the altar, which was considered most holy. This practice underscores the provision for the priests, who did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. It also highlights the principle of sharing in the offerings made to God, a theme that resonates with the New Testament teaching that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>It must be eaten without leaven</b><br>Leaven, or yeast, is often symbolic of sin and corruption in the Bible. The requirement for the offering to be eaten without leaven signifies purity and holiness, reflecting the nature of God and the sanctity required in worship. This connects to the New Testament where Jesus warns against the "leaven of the Pharisees," which is hypocrisy (<a href="/luke/12.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). The unleavened bread also points to Christ, the sinless one, who is the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>in a holy place;</b><br>The holy place refers to a location set apart for sacred purposes, emphasizing the sanctity of the act of consuming the offering. This requirement ensures that the priests maintain a reverent attitude towards the offerings, recognizing them as holy. The concept of holiness is central to Leviticus and is a reminder of God's call for His people to be holy as He is holy (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>).<p><b>they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.</b><br>The courtyard of the Tent of Meeting was the designated area for the priests to perform their duties and partake in the offerings. This location was accessible only to the priests, ensuring that the consumption of the offering remained a sacred act. The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites, symbolizing His desire to be with His people. This foreshadows the coming of Jesus, Emmanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>), and the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence with humanity through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and a key figure in the establishment of the priestly order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who served as priests, responsible for performing the rituals and sacrifices as outlined in the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_place.htm">Holy Place</a></b><br>Refers to the sacred area designated for worship and sacrifice, specifically the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where the priests performed their duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaven.htm">Leaven</a></b><br>A substance, typically yeast, used in dough to make it rise.
