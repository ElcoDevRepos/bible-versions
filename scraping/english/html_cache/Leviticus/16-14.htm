In the ancient Near Eastern context, blood was seen as the life force, and its use in rituals symbolized purification and consecration. This act underscores the necessity of a mediator who is himself cleansed before interceding for others, prefiguring Christ's role as the sinless high priest.<p><b>and sprinkle it with his finger</b><br>The act of sprinkling with the finger signifies a deliberate and personal application of the blood, emphasizing the priest's active role in the atonement process. This methodical action highlights the seriousness and sacredness of the ritual, ensuring that the blood is applied precisely as commanded.<p><b>on the east side of the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat, or the atonement cover, was the lid of the Ark of the Covenant, located in the Holy of Holies. The east side may symbolize the direction of the rising sun, often associated with new beginnings and divine presence. This specific location for the sprinkling indicates the precise obedience required in worship and the approach to God's holiness.<p><b>then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times</b><br>The number seven in biblical terms often represents completeness or perfection. Sprinkling the blood seven times signifies the thoroughness of the atonement process, ensuring that the sins are fully covered. This completeness points to the perfect and final atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice was once for all.<p><b>before the mercy seat</b><br>The mercy seat was the place where God's presence dwelt above the Ark, and it was here that the high priest made atonement for the people's sins. This act of sprinkling before the mercy seat symbolizes the intercession made on behalf of the people, foreshadowing Christ's role as the mediator between God and humanity.
