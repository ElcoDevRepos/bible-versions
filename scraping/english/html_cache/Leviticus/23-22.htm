The land was seen as a gift from God, and the Israelites were stewards of this divine provision. The harvest was a time of joy and thanksgiving, as seen in festivals like the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) and the Feast of Tabernacles, which celebrated God's provision.<p><b>do not reap all the way to the edges of your field</b><br>This command emphasizes the principle of generosity and provision for those in need. By not harvesting the edges, landowners were instructed to leave a portion of their produce for the less fortunate. This practice is an early form of social welfare, ensuring that the community cared for its vulnerable members. It reflects God's heart for justice and compassion, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-21</a>.<p><b>or gather the gleanings of your harvest</b><br>Gleanings refer to the leftover crops that were not collected during the initial harvest. The practice of leaving gleanings was a way to provide for the poor and the foreigner, allowing them to gather food with dignity. This is exemplified in the story of Ruth, who gleaned in the fields of Boaz (<a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2-3</a>), highlighting the kindness and provision extended to her as a foreigner and widow.<p><b>Leave them for the poor and the foreign resident</b><br>This directive underscores the inclusivity of God's care, extending beyond the Israelites to include foreigners residing among them. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>. The inclusion of foreigners also points to the future inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>I am the LORD your God.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This concluding phrase serves as a divine seal of authority, reminding the Israelites of their covenant relationship with God. It reinforces that these commands are not merely social or ethical guidelines but are rooted in the character and authority of God Himself.

Harvest time was a moment of celebration, hard work, and visible evidence of God&#8217;s provision (cf. <a href="/psalms/67-6.htm">Psalm 67:6</a>). By calling it &#8220;your land,&#8221; the Lord reminds His people of stewardship: the soil, the seed, and the sunshine all belong to Him (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle: daily work is sacred. Whether plowing, planting, or harvesting, every act is an act of worship (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Ownership under God: while the farmer legally possesses the land, God claims ultimate authority, setting the terms for its use (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not reap all the way to the edges of your field</b><p>The Lord issues an intentional limit on profit-maximization. He commands restraint so that a margin of grain remains untouched.<p>&#8226; Practical obedience: the farmer would literally stop his sickle or scythe some feet before the property line.<p>&#8226; Built-in generosity: God weaves care for others right into everyday routines, not merely occasional charity (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: similar boundary-setting appears in <a href="/exodus/23-10.htm">Exodus 23:10-11</a>, where the land itself rests in the seventh year so &#8220;the needy of your people may eat.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or gather the gleanings of your harvest</b><p>Gleanings are what falls or is missed on the first pass.
