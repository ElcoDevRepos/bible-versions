This practice symbolized the inner turmoil and separation from the community due to the disease.

This cry was both a confession of their impurity and a plea for mercy. It highlights the social and spiritual isolation experienced by those with leprosy, pointing to the need for healing and restoration.

Of course, lepers would naturally associate with each other, and so we find that they actually did (<a href="/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>). As their presence was supposed to defile any place that they entered, they were punished in later times with forty stripes if they did not observe the restraints laid down for them. "They were, however, admitted to the synagogue, where a place was railed off for them, ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering the house of worship before the rest of the congregation and leaving it after them" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The exclusion of the leper was not for the purpose of avoiding contagion, nor to serve as a penalty for having contracted so loathsome a disease, but primarily to prevent the spread of ceremonial uncleanness communicated by his touch, and typically and mystically to teach that the fate brought upon a man by unremoved sin is separation from the people of God here and hereafter. <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The diseased person</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ne&#183;&#7713;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
