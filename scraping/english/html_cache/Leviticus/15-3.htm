The discharge mentioned here is likely a bodily fluid, which in ancient Israelite culture, was associated with impurity. This reflects the broader Levitical concern with maintaining holiness and purity within the community, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>. The concept of uncleanness is not necessarily moral but ritual, emphasizing the separation between the holy and the common.<p><b>whether his body allows the discharge to flow</b><br>This phrase indicates that the condition is involuntary, highlighting the natural human experiences that can lead to ritual impurity. The focus on bodily functions underscores the comprehensive nature of the Levitical laws, which cover all aspects of life. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of human frailty and the need for divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>, which acknowledges human weakness.<p><b>or blocks it</b><br>The mention of a blocked discharge suggests a medical condition, reflecting the practical concerns of health and hygiene in ancient Israel. This attention to physical health is part of the broader Levitical emphasis on community well-being. The laws served not only a spiritual purpose but also a practical one, ensuring the health of the community. This can be seen as a precursor to modern understandings of public health.<p><b>So his discharge will bring about uncleanness</b><br>The discharge results in a state of uncleanness, necessitating purification rituals. This reflects the Levitical system's focus on maintaining the sanctity of the community and the tabernacle. The need for purification can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides ultimate purification from sin, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>. The temporary nature of the Levitical purification rituals points to the permanent cleansing offered through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites on matters of cleanliness and holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, who were called to live in a covenant relationship with God, marked by holiness and purity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the presence of God dwelled, and where purity laws were especially significant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ceremonial_uncleanness.htm">Understanding Ceremonial Uncleanness</a></b><br>The laws in <a href="/leviticus/15-3.htm">Leviticus 15:3</a> highlight the importance of ceremonial purity in maintaining a relationship with God.

Yet even ritual impurity reminds us of the deeper uncleanness of sin (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The clear declaration &#8220;This uncleanness&#8230;&#8221; leaves no doubt: God defines purity, and His people are called to take His definition seriously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From his discharge</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;from his discharge&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The word points to an abnormal bodily emission, likely connected to disease (cf. <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a> for the broader regulation).<p>&#8226; Physical health matters to God (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>). By isolating the sufferer, Israel limited contagion and taught that sickness&#8212;an effect of the Fall&#8212;does not belong in God&#8217;s sanctuary (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The sufferer&#8217;s condition pictures the inner defilement that only the Lord can cleanse (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>; <a href="/mark/1-40.htm">Mark 1:40-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whether his body allows the discharge to flow or blocks it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;whether his body allows the discharge to flow or blocks it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God covers every possibility: a continuous flow or an intermittent, obstructed trickle. Nothing slips through divine regulation (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Ongoing flow = persistent impurity; blocked flow = latent impurity. Either state leaves the man unclean until cleansing rites are completed (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The thoroughness anticipates Christ&#8217;s full atonement. He cleanses both visible acts and hidden attitudes (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So his discharge will bring about uncleanness</b><p>&#8220;So his discharge will bring about uncleanness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The effect is inevitable: contact spreads impurity to bedding, clothing, even those who carry such items (<a href="/leviticus/15-4.htm">Leviticus 15:4-12</a>). Sin likewise defiles everything it touches (<a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13-14</a>; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Required washings and sacrifices taught Israel the cost of purity (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13-15</a>). Today believers look to the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, whose blood &#8220;cleanses us from all sin&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; While New Testament believers are not under Levitical ritual, the principle endures: we guard fellowship with God by confessing and forsaking defilement (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-3.htm">Leviticus 15:3</a> identifies a man&#8217;s abnormal discharge as an objective source of ritual uncleanness, whether the flow is continual or temporarily obstructed. God&#8217;s meticulous standard protects the community, upholds His holiness, and illustrates humanity&#8217;s deeper need for cleansing. The passage foreshadows the perfect, comprehensive purification provided in Jesus Christ, who removes every stain&#8212;seen or unseen&#8212;and restores God&#8217;s people to worship in freedom and purity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Whether his flesh run.</span>--This verse defines more minutely the statement in the preceding verse.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1465;&#1435;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
