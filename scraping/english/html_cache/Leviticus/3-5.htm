This highlights the hereditary priesthood established by God through Aaron, emphasizing the importance of lineage and divine appointment in the priestly duties. The priesthood was a sacred office, and Aaron's sons were consecrated to serve in the tabernacle, representing the people before God.<p><b>are to burn it on the altar</b><br>The act of burning the offering on the altar signifies complete dedication to God. The altar, located in the Tabernacle's courtyard, was the central place for sacrifices, symbolizing the meeting point between God and man. Burning the offering represents purification and the transformation of the physical into the spiritual, as the smoke ascends to heaven.<p><b>atop the burnt offering</b><br>The peace offering was placed on top of the burnt offering, indicating a hierarchy and order in the sacrificial system. The burnt offering, which was entirely consumed by fire, symbolized atonement and complete surrender to God. By placing the peace offering atop it, it shows that reconciliation and fellowship with God are built upon the foundation of atonement.<p><b>that is on the burning wood</b><br>The burning wood signifies the continuous nature of the sacrificial fire, which was to be kept burning perpetually on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12-13</a>). This represents the ongoing need for atonement and the perpetual nature of God's covenant with Israel. The wood, often acacia, was chosen for its availability and durability.<p><b>as a food offering</b><br>The term "food offering" indicates that the sacrifice is seen as a meal shared with God, symbolizing fellowship and communion. This reflects the cultural practice of sharing meals as a sign of peace and relationship. The offering is not consumed by God in a literal sense but is a symbolic act of giving to God what is valuable.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" is a metaphorical expression indicating God's acceptance of the offering. It signifies that the sacrifice, when offered with a sincere heart, is pleasing to God. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), drawing a parallel between the Old Testament sacrifices and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The priests who were responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals.
