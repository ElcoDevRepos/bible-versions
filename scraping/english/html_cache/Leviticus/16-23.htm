The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was where God&#8217;s presence dwelled among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). The high priest entering the Tent of Meeting symbolizes mediation between God and Israel, foreshadowing Christ as the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>take off the linen garments</b><br>The linen garments were simple and humble, contrasting with the high priest's usual ornate attire. This act of removing the garments signifies the completion of the atonement process and the transition from sacred duties back to ordinary life. Linen, a symbol of purity and righteousness, points to the sinless nature of Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>).<p><b>he put on before entering the Most Holy Place</b><br>The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost part of the Tabernacle, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. Only the high priest could enter, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>). This exclusivity underscores the holiness of God and the separation caused by sin, which Christ ultimately bridged through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>).<p><b>and leave them there</b><br>Leaving the garments in the Tent of Meeting signifies the temporary nature of the Old Covenant rituals. It points to the need for a more permanent solution to sin, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).
