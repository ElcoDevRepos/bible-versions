The priest would physically wave the lambs, signifying their dedication to the LORD. This act demonstrated the Israelites' acknowledgment of God's provision and sovereignty. The lambs, as part of the sacrificial system, foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The waving motion may have symbolized the offering being lifted up to God, indicating His acceptance and blessing.<p><b>together with the bread of the firstfruits</b><br>The bread of the firstfruits refers to the loaves made from the initial harvest of grain, specifically during the Feast of Weeks, also known as Pentecost. This feast celebrated the beginning of the wheat harvest and was a time of thanksgiving for God's provision. The inclusion of bread signifies the offering of the first and best of the harvest to God, acknowledging Him as the source of all blessings. This act of offering the firstfruits is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to offer their lives as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>The bread and the two lambs shall be holy to the LORD for the priest</b><br>The designation of the bread and lambs as holy indicates that they are set apart for God's purposes. Holiness in the biblical context means being consecrated and dedicated to God. The priest, as a mediator between God and the people, receives these offerings, which underscores the role of the priesthood in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This concept of holiness and dedication is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who mediates the new covenant and sanctifies believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>). The offerings being holy to the LORD for the priest also highlight the provision for the priesthood, ensuring their sustenance as they serve in the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, performing sacred rituals and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering where the priest waves the offering before the LORD, symbolizing dedication and consecration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_of_the_firstfruits.htm">Bread of the Firstfruits</a></b><br>Represents the first yield of the harvest, offered to God as a sign of gratitude and acknowledgment of His provision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, to whom the offerings are made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_offering.htm">Sacred Offering</a></b><br>An offering set apart for God, signifying holiness and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest serves as an intermediary, pointing to the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who intercedes on our behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_the_wave_offering.htm">Significance of the Wave Offering</a></b><br>The wave offering symbolizes the dedication of our lives to God.

Whereupon they were slain, and the priest took the breast and shoulder of each one (see <a href="/context/leviticus/7-30.htm" title="His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.">Leviticus 7:30-32</a>), laid them down by the side of the two loaves, put both his hands under them, and waved them all together or separately towards the east side forwards and backwards, up and down. He then burned the fat of the two lambs, after which the remainder of the flesh, which became the perquisite of the officiating priest, was eaten by him and his fellow-priests. Of the two loaves the high priest took one, and the other was divided between the officiating priests, who had to eat them up within the same day and half the following night, just as the flesh of the most holy things. After these prescribed sacrifices had been offered, each individual brought his free-will offering, which formed the cheerful and hospitable meal of the family, and to which the Levite, the widow, the orphan, the poor, and the stranger, were invited.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;
