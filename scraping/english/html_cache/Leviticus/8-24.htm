This act signifies the importance of family lineage in the priesthood, as the priestly duties were to be passed down through Aaron's descendants. The presentation by Moses underscores his role as the mediator between God and the Israelites, a type of Christ who mediates the New Covenant.<p><b>and put some of the blood on their right earlobes,</b><br>The application of blood on the right earlobe symbolizes the consecration of the priests' hearing to God's word.
