The death of these animals and their contact with objects symbolize the transmission of impurity. In the ancient Near Eastern context, death was often associated with impurity and separation from the divine. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin and death bringing separation from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the fall of man.<p><b>that article becomes unclean</b><br>The concept of ritual impurity is central to Levitical law. Objects that come into contact with unclean animals are considered defiled. This underscores the pervasive nature of impurity and the need for purification. The idea of uncleanness can be seen as a metaphor for sin, which contaminates and separates individuals from God, as echoed in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>.<p><b>any article of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth, or any implement used for work</b><br>This list includes common materials and tools used in daily life in ancient Israel. The inclusion of these items highlights the comprehensive nature of the purity laws, affecting all aspects of life. The specificity of materials reflects the practical concerns of maintaining ritual purity in a community setting. This can be connected to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, where believers are encouraged to do everything for the glory of God, indicating that all aspects of life are under divine consideration.<p><b>must be rinsed with water</b><br>Water is a symbol of purification throughout the Bible. The act of rinsing signifies the removal of impurity and the restoration of the object's usability. This ritual cleansing prefigures the New Testament concept of baptism, where water symbolizes the washing away of sin and the believer's new life in Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>.<p><b>and will remain unclean until evening</b><br>The period until evening signifies a temporary state of impurity. Evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing renewal and restoration. This temporal aspect of uncleanness points to the hope of redemption and the eventual restoration of all things, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>.<p><b>then it will be clean</b><br>The final state of cleanness after the prescribed ritual indicates the possibility of restoration and reconciliation with God. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of redemption, where impurity and sin are not permanent states but can be overcome through divine provision. This is ultimately fulfilled in the work of Jesus Christ, who cleanses believers from sin, as stated in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The primary human author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as they journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_animals.htm">Unclean Animals</a></b><br>- The context of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> involves distinguishing between clean and unclean animals, which were part of the dietary laws given to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>- The central place of worship for the Israelites, where maintaining ritual purity was essential.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>- The time by which the unclean article would become clean again after being washed, marking a new day in the Hebrew calendar.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus highlight the importance of holiness and separation from impurity.

The verse assumes one of these small animals&#8212;like a mouse or lizard&#8212;has died and landed on an item you use every day.<p>&#8226; God is emphasizing that death, even on a tiny scale, represents the defilement that entered the world through sin (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By linking a dead creature with household goods, the Lord connects personal holiness to daily life, not just temple worship (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier verses have already explained that touching the carcass of an unclean animal makes a person unclean until evening (<a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-25</a>). Here He extends that principle to the items the carcass contacts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That article becomes unclean</b><p>Once the carcass contacts the object, the object shares in the impurity.<p>&#8226; Physical transfer illustrates spiritual truth: sin contaminates whatever it touches (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse treats ritual uncleanness seriously because it symbolizes moral uncleanness. <a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a> calls these regulations &#8220;a shadow of the good things to come,&#8221; pointing to Christ who removes true defilement (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; While New Testament believers are no longer under ceremonial law (<a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28-29</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>), the principle that holiness must resist contamination still stands (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Any article of wood, clothing, leather, sackcloth, or any implement used for work</b><p>The list moves from general (&#8220;article of wood&#8221;) to specific tools and textiles.<p>&#8226; God covers every ordinary material&#8212;wood, fabric, leather&#8212;showing no compartment of life is exempt from His concern (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Implement used for work&#8221; includes economic tools, reminding Israel that business practices must be governed by purity (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The inclusion of &#8220;sackcloth,&#8221; often worn in mourning (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>), hints that even expressions of grief can be tainted and need cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must be rinsed with water</b><p>The first remedy is simple washing.<p>&#8226; Water symbolizes both physical and spiritual cleansing (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>; <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Though external, the act reinforced that impurity required deliberate action; indifference was not acceptable (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The washing looked forward to the ultimate washing of regeneration through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And will remain unclean until evening</b><p>Time is added to washing.<p>&#8226; Evening marked a new day in Hebrew reckoning (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>).

While the ceremonial specifics were fulfilled in Christ, the passage still calls believers to guard against contamination, pursue cleansing through the finished work of Jesus, and enjoy restored fellowship with a holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And upon whatsoever any of them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and upon whatsoever aught of them, </span>that is, not only if the whole carcase fell upon any of the specified vessels were the vessels in question defiled, but if a portion of the carcase came in contact with the utensils it made them unclean. (See <a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>.) According to the law which obtained during the second Temple it was only when the portion of the carcase of an unclean animal had flesh on it that it defiled, but not otherwise. Hence the skins, hair, bones, horns, hoofs, sinews, &c. of all unclean creatures were exempted. These were made into different domestic utensils and implements. The use thus made of the parts in question also constituted one of the differences between the Pharisees and the Sadducees in the time of Christ. The Sadducees regarded every portion of every unclean animal in whatever state as defiling, and hence prohibited its being made up into any vessel.<p><span class= "bld">Vessel of wood.</span>--That is, vessels made of bulrushes (<a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm" title="That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!">Isaiah 18:2</a>), reeds, wicker, shells of nuts, barks of trees, or of anything which grew out of the earth like wood.<p><span class= "bld">Or raiment.</span>--That is, any garment made of a woven material, such as wool, flax, hemp, or anything which grows on the dry land. Hence cloth made of a material which grows in the sea was not defiled, according to the canons which obtained during the second Temple.<p><span class= "bld">Or skin.</span>--This also, according to the same authorities, only applied to the skins of land animals; skins of aquatic creatures received no defilement.<p><span class= "bld">Or</span> <span class= "bld">sack.</span>--From the parallel passage in <a href="/numbers/31-20.htm" title="And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.">Numbers 31:20</a>, we see that by this expression here is meant garments made of stuffs of goats' hair, in contradistinction to the textures of which the garments were made, denoted by the expression <span class= "ital">beged, </span>"raiment." (See also <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>.) Skins which were not made into garments or vessels, or which exhibited unfinished vessels, received no pollution. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
