The ram, a valuable animal, signifies the seriousness of sin and the costliness of atonement. This offering is a "guilt offering," which is distinct from other offerings like the sin offering or burnt offering, focusing on restitution and reconciliation. The concept of "proper value" indicates that the offering must be commensurate with the offense, reflecting the justice and fairness inherent in God's law. This practice foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is described as the Lamb of God, unblemished and perfect, offering Himself for the sins of humanity.<p><b>Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the wrong he has committed in ignorance,</b><br>The role of the priest as a mediator is crucial in the Old Testament sacrificial system. The priest acts as an intermediary between God and man, highlighting the need for a go-between in the process of atonement. The phrase "for the wrong he has committed in ignorance" points to the fact that not all sins are committed willfully; some are done unknowingly. This provision in the law shows God's grace and understanding of human frailty. It also emphasizes the comprehensive nature of sin, which affects individuals even when they are unaware. This anticipates the New Testament teaching that Christ, our High Priest, makes atonement for all sins, known and unknown, through His sacrifice.<p><b>and he will be forgiven.</b><br>Forgiveness is the ultimate goal of the sacrificial system, restoring the relationship between the sinner and God. This assurance of forgiveness upon the completion of the prescribed ritual reflects God's mercy and willingness to reconcile with His people. It also points to the completeness and sufficiency of the atonement provided by Christ, who offers eternal forgiveness to those who believe in Him. The certainty of forgiveness in this context provides a foundation for understanding the New Covenant, where faith in Christ's sacrifice ensures forgiveness and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator between God and the people, responsible for offering sacrifices and making atonement for sins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinner.htm">The Sinner</a></b><br>An individual who has committed an unintentional sin and seeks forgiveness through the prescribed offering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram.htm">The Ram</a></b><br>A sacrificial animal without blemish, symbolizing purity and the cost of atonement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guilt_offering.htm">The Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice required for atonement of unintentional sins, emphasizing the seriousness of sin and the need for restitution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices were made, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin, even when unintentional, requires atonement.

Forgiveness rests not on feelings but on God&#8217;s declared acceptance of the sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/4-31.htm">Leviticus 4:31</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ we hear the same assurance: &#8220;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a> reinforces the principle: confess, trust the sacrifice, receive cleansing&#8212;because God said so.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a> reveals a gracious God who provides a clear path from guilt to forgiveness. The sinner comes, brings a costly, flawless substitute, the priest mediates, atonement is made, and forgiveness is granted. Each detail&#8212;personal responsibility, a spotless sacrifice, priestly intercession, and assured pardon&#8212;points forward to Jesus Christ, the perfect Lamb and eternal High Priest, who fulfills the pattern once for all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">And he shall bring a ram.</span>--Under such circumstances of suspense and feelings of guilt, he is to bring the same victim as in the former instance.<p><span class= "bld">With thy</span> <span class= "bld">estimation.</span>--That is, according to thy <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Moses' valuation, the ram is to be worth two shekels.

Still, as the case is a doubtful one, he is exempt from the additional fifth part which the transgressor had to pay who indisputably committed this offence in ignorance. (See <a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm" title="And he shall make amends for the harm that he has done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 5:16</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/5-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He must bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1492;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
