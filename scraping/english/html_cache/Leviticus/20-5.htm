In biblical terms, God setting His face against someone signifies His active disfavor and intention to punish. The family is included, highlighting the communal nature of sin and its consequences in ancient Israelite society. This reflects the covenantal relationship where the actions of an individual could impact the entire family unit, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>and cut off from among their people</b><br>To be "cut off" implies a severe form of divine judgment, often understood as death or excommunication. This reflects the seriousness of idolatry and its threat to the holiness of the community. The phrase underscores the importance of maintaining purity and obedience within the covenant community, as seen in other passages like <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a> and <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30-31</a>.<p><b>both him and all who follow him</b><br>This highlights the collective responsibility and the influence of leaders or individuals on others. It serves as a warning against leading others into sin, reminiscent of Jesus' warning in <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> about causing others to stumble. The communal aspect of sin and its consequences is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>in prostituting themselves with Molech</b><br>The term "prostituting" is used metaphorically to describe idolatry, equating it with spiritual unfaithfulness. Molech worship involved detestable practices, including child sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). This idolatry is seen as a betrayal of the covenant relationship with God, akin to adultery. The severity of the language underscores the abomination of such practices and the need for Israel to remain distinct from surrounding nations, as emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/molech.htm">Molech</a></b><br>A pagan deity associated with child sacrifice, worshiped by some ancient Near Eastern cultures.
