The altar, located in the Tabernacle's courtyard, is where sacrifices are made to God. This act signifies Aaron's role as a mediator between God and the Israelites. The altar represents a place of divine encounter and atonement, a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is both the high priest and the offering.<p><b>and slaughtered the calf</b><br>The calf is chosen as a sin offering, a specific type of sacrifice meant to atone for sin and restore the relationship between the sinner and God. The act of slaughtering the animal is a vivid reminder of the cost of sin, requiring the shedding of blood for atonement. This foreshadows the sacrificial death of Jesus, the Lamb of God, whose blood was shed for the sins of humanity.<p><b>as a sin offering for himself</b><br>Aaron, despite his high priestly status, is not exempt from sin and must first make atonement for himself before he can intercede for the people. This highlights the imperfection of the Levitical priesthood and the need for a perfect high priest, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is sinless and offers Himself as the ultimate sin offering. This act underscores the holiness required to approach God and the necessity of purification, a theme echoed throughout the New Testament in the call for believers to be holy as God is holy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
