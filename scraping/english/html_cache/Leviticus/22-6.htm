In the context of Leviticus, "these" refers to things that render a person unclean, such as contact with a dead body or certain bodily discharges. The concept of cleanliness is central to the Levitical law, emphasizing the holiness required to approach God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and impurity, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm">Isaiah 52:11</a>, which calls for purity among God's people.<p><b>will remain unclean until evening</b><br>The stipulation of remaining unclean until evening highlights the temporary nature of ceremonial impurity. Evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Hebrew calendar, symbolizing renewal and restoration. This temporal aspect of uncleanness points to the hope of redemption and cleansing, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who provides eternal purification (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>He must not eat from the sacred offerings</b><br>Sacred offerings were part of the sacrificial system, which included various types of sacrifices such as burnt offerings, peace offerings, and sin offerings. These offerings were holy and set apart for God, and only those who were ceremonially clean could partake in them. This restriction underscores the importance of approaching God with reverence and purity, a principle echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-27.htm">1 Corinthians 11:27-29</a> regarding the Lord's Supper.<p><b>unless he has bathed himself with water</b><br>The act of bathing with water symbolizes purification and cleansing. Water is a recurring symbol of purification throughout Scripture, seen in the ritual washings of the Old Testament and the baptism of the New Testament. This requirement foreshadows the spiritual cleansing that comes through Jesus Christ, who offers living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>) and cleanses believers from sin (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary audience of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/22.htm">Leviticus 22</a>, the priests were responsible for maintaining ritual purity to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle/temple.htm">Tabernacle/Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the sacred offerings were made.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_offerings.htm">Sacred Offerings</a></b><br>These were offerings dedicated to God, which the priests were allowed to eat under conditions of ritual purity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanliness.htm">Uncleanliness</a></b><br>A state that prevented individuals from participating in religious activities, often due to contact with certain objects or situations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which ritual uncleanliness would end, symbolizing a new day and a return to purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity_and_holiness.htm">Ritual Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>The laws of cleanliness in Leviticus highlight the importance of approaching God with reverence and purity.

This phrase removes loopholes: whatever the source, contamination is contamination (compare <a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-3.htm">Deuteronomy 14:3-8</a>). God&#8217;s standards are comprehensive, reminding His people that partial obedience is not obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will remain unclean until evening</b><p>The same time frame appears in <a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24</a> and <a href="/leviticus/15-16.htm">Leviticus 15:16</a>. Evening marked the start of a new day (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>), so impurity had a clear, measurable limit. It teaches:<p>&#8226; Sin and impurity separate, but God provides a definite path back.<p>&#8226; Restoration is grounded in God&#8217;s timetable, not personal preference (<a href="/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Waiting cultivates reverence; rushing back to holy duties would cheapen God&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must not eat from the sacred offerings</b><p>Sacred offerings&#8212;portions set apart for priests from grain, peace, and sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>; 10:12-13)&#8212;were God&#8217;s provision for their sustenance. Yet even legitimate privileges are suspended when holiness is breached (<a href="/leviticus/10-18.htm">Leviticus 10:18</a>). The lesson: ministry benefits never trump God&#8217;s purity; service flows from holiness, not the other way around.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>unless he has bathed himself with water</b><p>Washing symbolizes God-ordained cleansing (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>). The outward act points to an inner reality:<p>&#8226; Cleansing comes from God&#8217;s provided means, echoing <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a> that salvation is &#8220;washing of rebirth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The priest&#8217;s bath foreshadows the believer&#8217;s continual confession (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Water is ordinary, yet commanded; grace operates through simple obedience, not elaborate rituals (<a href="/2_kings/5-13.htm">2 Kings 5:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/22-6.htm">Leviticus 22:6</a> shows God&#8217;s unwavering standard: contact with defilement makes a person unfit for holy privileges until divinely prescribed cleansing occurs. Holiness is both positional and practical&#8212;maintained by obedience, time set apart, and God&#8217;s appointed washing.
