This act reflects the importance of cleanliness and holiness in worship, as seen throughout Leviticus. The washing signifies the need for internal purity, aligning with <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, which speaks of a clean heart. The priests' role in washing these parts underscores their duty to maintain ritual purity, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the call for believers to be pure and holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>and burned them atop the burnt offering on the altar.</b><br>The burning of the entrails and legs on the altar signifies the complete dedication of the offering to God. The burnt offering, or "olah," was entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing total surrender and devotion. This act of burning atop the altar points to the idea of a pleasing aroma to the Lord, as mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>. The altar, central to Israelite worship, represents the place where atonement and reconciliation with God occur. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly for humanity's sins, as described in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.
