The bull represents the seriousness of sin and the need for a significant sacrifice. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity.<p><b>he must take outside the camp</b><br>Taking the remains outside the camp signifies the removal of sin from the community. In ancient Israel, the camp represented the dwelling place of God's people, and anything unclean or sinful was to be removed to maintain holiness.

This reflects the holiness of God and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence and purity. It also highlights the separation between the sacred and the profane.<p><b>where the ashes are poured out,</b><br>Ashes from previous sacrifices were disposed of in a designated area, emphasizing the continuity and regularity of sacrificial practices. This practice ensured that the remains of the sacrifices did not defile the camp, maintaining the community's purity.<p><b>and there he must burn it on a wood fire</b><br>Burning the remains on a wood fire signifies the complete consumption and destruction of the sin offering, symbolizing the total eradication of sin. The use of wood is reminiscent of the cross, where Christ was sacrificed, fulfilling the ultimate sin offering.<p><b>on the ash heap.</b><br>The ash heap, or "place of removal," served as a constant reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for atonement.

Nothing that has now been identified with sin may remain in the camp. See <a href="/leviticus/4-8.htm">Leviticus 4:8-10</a> for the fat already burned on the altar and <a href="/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a> for the same practice in the priestly ordination offering.

Hence the ancient Greek Version (LXX.) and the Samaritan rightly render it by "and they shall carry," in the plural: <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the whole bullock <span class= "ital">shall be </span>carried forth. In <a href="/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24</a> of this very chapter the Authorised Version properly translates the same idiom into "in the place where <span class= "ital">they </span>kill the burnt offering," though the verb, as in the verse before us, is in the singular.

It is this place to which the Apostle refers when he says, "for the bodies of those beast whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as <span class= "ital">an offering </span>for sin are burned without the camp.
