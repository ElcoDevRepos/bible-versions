The removal of the crop and its contents signifies the removal of impurities before the offering is made to God. This act symbolizes the need for purity and holiness in worship, reflecting the broader Levitical theme of separating the clean from the unclean. The crop, being the part of the bird that holds food, represents the removal of earthly sustenance and reliance, pointing to a dependence on God alone. This purification process can be seen as a type of Christ, who was without blemish or impurity, offering Himself as a perfect sacrifice.<p><b>and throw it to the east side of the altar</b><br>The east side of the altar is significant in biblical symbolism. In the tabernacle and later the temple, the entrance faced east, and thus the east side was the direction from which one approached God. Throwing the removed parts to the east side may symbolize casting away impurities as one approaches the divine presence. The east is also associated with the rising sun, symbolizing new beginnings and hope, which aligns with the theme of renewal and atonement in the sacrificial system. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who removes our sins and allows us to approach God.<p><b>in the place for ashes</b><br>The place for ashes was designated for the disposal of the remains of sacrifices, signifying the completion of the offering process. Ashes, in biblical terms, often symbolize mourning, repentance, and humility. By placing the removed parts in the ash heap, it underscores the finality of the purification process and the seriousness of approaching God with a pure heart. This act of disposal also points to the complete and final atonement made by Christ, who bore our sins and removed them as far as the east is from the west, allowing believers to stand cleansed before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as outlined in Leviticus.
