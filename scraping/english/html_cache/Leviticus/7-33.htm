The Aaronic priesthood was established by God to serve in the tabernacle and later in the temple. The priests were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the rituals prescribed in the Law. This lineage highlights the hereditary nature of the priesthood, emphasizing the continuity and sanctity of the priestly office.<p><b>who presents the blood and fat</b><br>In the sacrificial system, the presentation of blood and fat was a critical component. The blood, representing life, was sprinkled on the altar as an atonement for sin, while the fat, considered the best part of the animal, was burned as an offering to God. This act symbolized the offering of the best to God and the purification of the people. The priest's role in this process underscores their mediatory function between God and the Israelites.<p><b>of the peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, also known as the fellowship offering, was a voluntary sacrifice expressing thanksgiving, fulfillment of a vow, or freewill devotion. It symbolized reconciliation and communion with God, as well as fellowship among the worshipers. Unlike other offerings, a portion of the peace offering was consumed by the offerer, signifying shared fellowship with God.<p><b>shall have the right thigh as a portion</b><br>The right thigh, or right shoulder, was given to the officiating priest as a portion of the peace offering. This allocation was a provision for the priests, who had no inheritance of land like the other tribes of Israel. The right thigh was considered a choice part of the animal, reflecting the honor and provision given to those serving in the priesthood.

By identifying the &#8220;son of Aaron,&#8221; the text underscores personal responsibility: each priest had to carry out his duties faithfully, not resting on family reputation alone (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who presents the blood</b><p>&#8226; Presenting, or sprinkling, the blood was the climax of every sacrifice, because &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you&#8230;to make atonement for your souls&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This act symbolized substitutionary atonement: innocent blood shed so the worshiper could approach God in peace.<p>&#8226; Only a consecrated priest could touch the altar with blood, showing that mediation between holy God and sinful humanity is God-appointed, never self-appointed (<a href="/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fat of the peace offering</b><p>&#8226; The fat was considered the choicest part of the animal and belonged exclusively to the Lord: &#8220;All the fat is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning the fat on the altar sent up &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD,&#8221; signifying the worshiper&#8217;s desire to give God the best (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a> uses the same imagery).<p>&#8226; Because a peace offering celebrated restored fellowship (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; 7:11&#8211;15), offering both blood and fat declared that peace with God rests on substitution and consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall have the right thigh</b><p>&#8226; After God&#8217;s portion was burned, He assigned a specific part of the animal to the officiating priest&#8212;the right thigh (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The right thigh was meaty and valuable, symbolizing honor and strength; by giving it to the priest, God dignified the servant who labored at the altar (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17&#8211;18</a> echoes this principle).<p>&#8226; This pattern appears elsewhere: when Samuel hosted Saul, he said, &#8220;Here is the portion that was set apart for you: eat, because it has been kept for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-24.htm">1 Samuel 9:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a portion</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Portion&#8221; points to God&#8217;s ordained provision. The priest had no tribal land inheritance; the Lord Himself&#8212;and the offerings&#8212;were his supply (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; By feeding priests from the sacrifices, God intertwined worship and livelihood, teaching Israel that supporting spiritual leadership is an act of obedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; This allocation also fostered shared joy: worshiper, priest, and family all partook of the same peace-offering meal, reflecting unity under God&#8217;s covenant care (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-33.htm">Leviticus 7:33</a> spells out God&#8217;s orderly generosity. The consecrated priest&#8212;&#8220;the son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering&#8221;&#8212;receives the right thigh as his divinely appointed share. The verse highlights God&#8217;s holiness (blood), His claim on the best (fat), and His provision for faithful servants (right thigh). In every detail, the law points forward to Christ, our ultimate Priest and Peace-Offering, who supplies all we need while drawing us into lasting fellowship with the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/7-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
