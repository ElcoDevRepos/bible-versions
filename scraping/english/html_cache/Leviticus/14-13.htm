The sanctuary area, part of the Tabernacle, was where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites. This location signifies the importance of the offering being made directly before God. The lamb, often a symbol of innocence and purity, prefigures Christ, the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for the sins of humanity (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered</b><br>The sin offering and burnt offering were central to the sacrificial system, representing atonement and dedication to God. The shared location for these sacrifices highlights the interconnectedness of atonement and consecration. The sin offering dealt with purification from sin, while the burnt offering symbolized complete surrender to God. This foreshadows the comprehensive work of Christ, who both atones for sin and calls believers to a life of dedication (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>Like the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest</b><br>The priest's role in receiving the offering emphasizes the mediatory function of the priesthood, which points to Christ as our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The guilt offering, also known as the trespass offering, was made for specific transgressions and required restitution. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and reconciliation, which is fulfilled in Christ's work on the cross, reconciling humanity to God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<p><b>it is most holy</b><br>The designation of the offering as "most holy" indicates its special status and the reverence required in handling it. This holiness is a reminder of God's purity and the need for holiness in worship. The concept of holiness is central to the Levitical laws and is fulfilled in the New Testament through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter

href="/leviticus/14-13.htm">Leviticus 14:13</a> shows that the guilt offering for a cleansed leper mirrors the sin offering in procedure, location, priestly portion, and holiness. The priest slaughters the lamb at the altar, presents its blood for atonement, receives the meat as God-given provision, and handles it with utmost reverence. Together these details highlight God&#8217;s orderly plan for cleansing, the costliness of sin, the provision for His servants, and the sacredness of restored fellowship&#8212;a plan ultimately realized in Jesus Christ, our perfect and final offering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And he shall slay the lamb.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the lamb shall be killed. </span>On ordinary occasions the sacrificer himself slaughtered the victim on the north side of the altar (see <a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm" title="And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about on the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 1:5</a>); but as the convalescent was not as yet allowed to enter the court, other persons appointed for these occasions killed the sacrifice. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version of the so-called Jonathan ben Uzziel rightly renders it, "And the slaughterer shall slay the lamb." The phrase is therefore better rendered in the passive, as is often the case in Hebrew. Before the sacrifice was slain the offerer had to lay his hands on the victim. (See <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a>.) For the reason, however, already stated, the convalescent could not do it before the altar. The lamb was therefore brought to the door of the court where the leper stood, and the convalescent put his hands through the gate of Nicanor, and laid them on the victim. From this place the purification was performed of men who contracted defilement from a running issue, and of women when they brought their offerings after childbirth. (See <a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm" title="And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:">Leviticus 12:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In the place where he shall kill the sin offering.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in the place where they kill, </span>&c, as exactly the same phrase is rendered by the Authorised Version in chap 4:33: that is, in the court of the sanctuary, on the north side of the altar (see <a href="/leviticus/1-11.htm" title="And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about on the altar.">Leviticus 1:11</a>;
