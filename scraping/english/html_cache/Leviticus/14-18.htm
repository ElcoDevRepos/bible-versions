The priest's use of oil signifies the setting apart of the individual for God's purposes. The oil remaining in the priest's palm after the initial application to the ear, thumb, and toe of the cleansed person indicates a surplus of God's provision and blessing.<p><b>the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed</b><br>The anointing of the head with oil is a significant act, symbolizing the complete purification and sanctification of the individual. In biblical times, anointing the head was often associated with kingship and priesthood, suggesting a restoration to a state of honor and dignity. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who cleanses believers from sin.<p><b>to make atonement for him</b><br>Atonement is a central theme in Leviticus, emphasizing reconciliation between God and humanity. The Hebrew word for atonement, "kaphar," means to cover or to make reconciliation. This act of atonement signifies the removal of impurity and the restoration of the individual to a right relationship with God. It prefigures the atoning work of Christ, who provides the ultimate covering for sin through His sacrifice.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" underscores the presence and authority of God in the ritual. It indicates that the cleansing and atonement are not merely ceremonial but are performed in the sight of God, who is the ultimate judge and redeemer. This reflects the biblical principle that all acts of worship and purification are to be conducted with reverence and accountability to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the cleansing rituals and making atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_to_be_cleansed.htm">The One to be Cleansed</a></b><br>An individual who has been afflicted with a skin disease (often translated as leprosy) and is undergoing the purification process.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides the means for atonement and restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oil.htm">The Oil</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Holy Spirit and anointing, used in the ritual to signify purification and consecration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the rituals are performed, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator, pointing to Christ as our ultimate High Priest who intercedes for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_oil.htm">Symbolism of Oil</a></b><br>Oil represents the Holy Spirit's work in cleansing, healing, and consecrating believers for God's service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/atonement_and_restoration.htm">Atonement and Restoration</a></b><br>The ritual underscores the need for atonement and the restoration of fellowship with God, fulfilled in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The cleansing process highlights God's call for His people to be holy and pure, set apart for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_worship.htm">Community and Worship</a></b><br>The restoration of the cleansed individual to the community and worship life of Israel reflects the importance of communal faith and worship.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_14_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 14:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_14_18_God_s_cleansing_provision.htm">How does Leviticus 14:18 illustrate God's provision for spiritual and physical cleansing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Priest_s_role_in_Leviticus_14_18_cleansing.htm">What role does the priest play in the cleansing process in Leviticus 14:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Leviticus_14_18_to_Jesus_priesthood.htm">How does Leviticus 14:18 connect to Jesus' role as our High Priest?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Leviticus_14_18_today.htm">How can we apply the principles of cleansing in Leviticus 14:18 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Lev_14_18_teach_on_sin_s_gravity.htm">What does the "atonement for him" in Leviticus 14:18 teach about sin's seriousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Priest_s_role_in_Leviticus_14_18_today.htm">What is the significance of the priest's role in Leviticus 14:18 for modern believers?

What remains after the initial sprinkling is &#8220;the rest of the oil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Oil in Scripture regularly symbolizes the Holy Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying presence (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>). Just as the oil is literal, so is the picture: after forgiveness is pronounced, there is still more of God&#8217;s work to be applied.<p>&#8226; The fact that the oil stays in the priest&#8217;s palm highlights that this grace comes from God through His appointed mediator (cf. <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed</b><p>&#8226; By placing the oil on the head, the priest publicly identifies the formerly unclean person as accepted and restored.
