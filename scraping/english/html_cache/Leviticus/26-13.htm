It is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This declaration is foundational, as it asserts God's sovereignty and His role as the divine lawgiver. It echoes the introduction of the Ten Commandments in <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>, reinforcing the continuity of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>who brought you out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the historical event of the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery. It serves as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness. The Exodus is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing salvation and liberation. It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin. The land of Egypt represents oppression and idolatry, contrasting with the freedom and worship of the true God.<p><b>so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians</b><br>This highlights the purpose of God's deliverance: to free the Israelites from physical and spiritual bondage. Slavery in Egypt is symbolic of the broader human condition of enslavement to sin. The liberation from Egypt is a type of the greater redemption found in Christ, who offers freedom from sin and death. This phrase underscores God's desire for His people to live in freedom and serve Him alone.<p><b>I broke the bars of your yoke</b><br>The imagery of breaking the yoke signifies liberation from oppression. In ancient times, a yoke was a wooden beam used to harness animals for labor, symbolizing subjugation and control. God's action in breaking the yoke represents His intervention to remove the burdens of His people. This act of deliverance is a foreshadowing of Christ's work, who invites all to take His yoke, which is easy and light (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>).<p><b>and enabled you to walk in uprightness</b><br>This phrase indicates the transformation and empowerment that comes from God's deliverance. Walking in uprightness implies living a life of righteousness and obedience to God's commandments. It reflects the moral and ethical standards expected of God's people. This transformation is made possible by God's grace and is a call to holiness, echoing the New Testament exhortation to live by the Spirit and not gratify the desires of the flesh (<a

href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,&#8221;).<p>- This statement is not metaphorical; it is a literal self-identification underscoring that every promise and command rests on His character (<a href="/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who brought you out of the land of Egypt</b><p>- God points to a historical fact: the literal deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-51.htm">Exodus 12:51</a>).<p>- This rescue reveals His power over nations and His commitment to keep covenant promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>).<p>- Remembering actual events strengthens faith; the same God who acted then still acts today (<a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that you would

9:4</a>).<p>- The breaking is decisive and complete, highlighting that no human power can restrain those whom God liberates.<p>- Believers today can trust that the Lord still demolishes strongholds&#8212;addictions, fears, and oppressive systems&#8212;when they submit to His authority (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And enabled you

covenant-keeping LORD who literally rescued Israel from Egypt, liberated them from slavery, shattered every oppressive restraint, and empowered them to live upright, obedient lives. The verse assures believers that the same faithful God still delivers, frees, breaks yokes, and enables His people to walk in the dignity and freedom He has provided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">I have broken the bands of your yoke.</span>--The promises thus made to the Israelites of the extraordinary fertility of their land, of peace within and immunity from war without, and of the Divine presence constantly sojourning amongst them, if they will faithfully obey the commandments of the Lord, now conclude with the oft-repeated solemn appeal to the obligation they are under to the God who had so marvellously delivered them from cruel bondage and made them His servants. To remind them of the abject state from which they were rescued, the illustration is taken from the way in which oxen are still harnessed in the East. The bands or the rods are straight pieces of wood, which are inserted in the yoke, or laid across the necks of the animals, to fasten together their heads and keep them level with each other. These bands, which are then attached to the pole of the waggon, are not only oppressive, but exhibit the beasts as perfectly helpless to resist the cruel treatment of the driver. This phrase is often used to denote oppression and tyranny (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm" title="Therefore shall you serve your enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until he have destroyed you.">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm" title="You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.">Isaiah 9:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.">Isaiah 10:27</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-25.htm" title="That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.">Isaiah 14:25</a>, &c.), but nowhere are the words as like those in the passage before us as in <a href="/ezekiel/34-27.htm" title="And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.">Ezekiel 34:27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I have broken the bands of your yoke.</span> This expression, used also in the parallel passage of Ezekiel above referred to (<a href="/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>), and <a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a> receives an illustration from the ancient method of harnessing oxen, still kept up in the East and South. <span class="accented">The band</span> means the straight piece of wood laid across the necks of the oxen, by which their heads are fastened together to keep them level with each other, and by which they are attached to the pole of the wagon.
