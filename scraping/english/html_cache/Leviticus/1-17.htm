The act of tearing the bird open by its wings without dividing it completely signifies a complete yet undivided sacrifice, symbolizing total dedication to God. This method of preparation is unique to birds, as larger animals were divided. The tearing without complete division may symbolize the unity and wholeness of the offering, reflecting the worshiper's complete devotion. This act foreshadows the sacrifice of Christ, who was wholly offered yet remained undivided in His divine purpose.<p><b>And the priest is to burn it on the altar atop the burning wood.</b><br>The burning of the offering on the altar signifies the complete consumption of the sacrifice by fire, representing purification and the ascent of the offering to God. The altar, central to Israelite worship, was a place of divine encounter and atonement. The burning wood signifies the continual presence of fire, a symbol of God's holiness and judgment. This act of burning the offering points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who was wholly consumed by His passion and death, offering Himself as a fragrant offering to God.<p><b>It is a burnt offering, a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.</b><br>The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, signifies an offering that ascends to God, wholly consumed by fire. As a food offering, it represents sustenance and fellowship with God, though not consumed by the priests or worshipers. The phrase "a pleasing aroma to the LORD" indicates God's acceptance and satisfaction with the offering, symbolizing reconciliation and favor. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), fulfilling the typology of the burnt offering as a means of atonement and divine pleasure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals, acting as a mediator between the people and God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where offerings are made to God, symbolizing worship and atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_burnt_offering.htm">The Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire offering is consumed by fire, representing complete surrender to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bird.htm">The Bird</a></b><br>In this context, a turtledove or young pigeon, which was an acceptable offering for those who could not afford larger animals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, to whom the offerings are made, signifying His holiness and the need for atonement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/complete_surrender.htm">Complete Surrender</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes total dedication to God.
