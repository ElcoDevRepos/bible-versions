This communication often involves instructions for worship, law, and community living, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people.<p><b>after the death of two of Aaron&#8217;s sons</b><br>This refers to the tragic event recorded in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, offered unauthorized fire before the LORD and were consumed by fire as a result. This incident highlights the holiness of God and the seriousness of approaching Him in a manner not prescribed by His commandments. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the need for reverence in worship.<p><b>when they approached the presence of the LORD</b><br>The "presence of the LORD" refers to the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt above the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant. This was the most sacred space, and only the high priest could enter, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). The incident with Aaron's sons underscores the sanctity of this space and the necessity of following God's specific instructions for worship and sacrifice. This foreshadows the ultimate access to God's presence through Jesus Christ, who, as the perfect high priest, entered the heavenly Holy of Holies once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews

directly from Him (cf. <a href="/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>).<p>- Moses, already God&#8217;s chosen mediator (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10-12</a>), receives further revelation that guides Israel&#8217;s worship and safeguards their lives.<p>- The phrase &#8220;the LORD spoke&#8221; echoes earlier moments in the wilderness journey (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm">Leviticus 1:1</a>; <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s voice, not human opinion, governs worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after

(<a href="/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>).<p>- The setting prepares us for the Day of Atonement regulations that follow (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-34</a>), showing Israel the one safe pathway into God&#8217;s presence through an appointed mediator and atoning blood (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/16-1.htm">Leviticus 16:1</a> anchors the Day of Atonement in a real, sobering event: the fatal error of Nadab and Abihu. God&#8217;s direct speech to Moses, set against that backdrop, stresses that approaching His holy presence is never casual. It must unfold precisely as He commands, through the mediator He appoints, and with the atonement He provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XVI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And the Lord spake unto Moses.</span>--As the observance of the minute regulations given in the preceding chapters about the daily sacrifices and purifications would necessarily be tainted with many imperfections and shortcomings, both on the part of the mediating priests and the offering laity, a general day of atonement is here instituted, when priest and people are alike to obtain atonement once a year for the sins which were mixed up even with their sacred worship. The day of atonement enacted in the chapter before us is therefore an appropriate conclusion of the laws of purification in the preceding chapters. It is an annual supplement and completion of all the ordinances which were daily practised, and the design of which was to obtain atonement and reconciliation.<p><span class= "bld">After the death of the two sons of Aaron.</span>--That is, after Nadab and Abihu, his two eldest sons, had died, in consequence of having presumptuously entered the sanctuary in a profane manner, and at an irregular time. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/10-1.htm" title="And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>.)<p>PART III. <p>SECTION II. <p>CHAPTER 16. THE CEREMONIAL PURIFICATION OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION ON THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT. This chapter, containing the account of the institution of the ceremonial to be used on the Day of Atonement, would take its place chronologically immediately after the tenth chapter, for the instructions conveyed in it were delivered to Moses <span class="accented">"after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord and died"</span> (verse 1), when the fate of Nadab and Abihu would naturally have led Aaron to desire a more perfect knowledge than had as yet been imparted to him as to the manner in which he was to present himself before the Lord. Logically it might either occupy its present position, as being the great and culminating atoning and cleansing ceremony, or it might be relegated to a place among the holy days in chapter 23, where it is, in fact, shortly noticed. That it is placed here shows that the most essential characteristic of the Day in the judgment of the legislator is that of its serving as the occasion and the means of "making <span class="accented">an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and making an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and for making an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation"</span> (verse 33). Annually there gathered over the camp, and over the sanctuary as situated in the midst of the camp, a mass of defilement, arising in part from sins whose guilt had not been removed by the punishment of the offenders, and in part from uncleannesses which had not been cleansed by sacrifices and the prescribed ceremonial rites. Annually this defilement had to be atoned for or covered away from the sight of God. This was done by the solemn observance of the great Day of Atonement, and specially by the high priest's carrying the blood of the sacrifices into the holy of holies, into which he might enter on no other day of the year; while the consciousness of deliverance from the guilt of sin was quickened on the part of the people by their seeing the scapegoat <span class="accented">"bear</span> <span class="accented">away upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited"</span> (verse 22). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
