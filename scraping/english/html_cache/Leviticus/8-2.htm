This selection signifies the beginning of a hereditary priesthood in Israel, emphasizing the importance of lineage and divine appointment in spiritual leadership. Aaron, as the first high priest, prefigures Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who mediates between God and humanity.<p><b>their garments</b><br>The priestly garments were specifically designed and commanded by God, as detailed in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. These garments symbolized holiness and were meant to set the priests apart for their sacred duties. Each piece of clothing had spiritual significance, such as the ephod, breastplate, and turban, representing various aspects of the priestly role and pointing to the righteousness and intercession of Christ.<p><b>the anointing oil</b><br>Anointing oil was used to consecrate the priests, signifying the Holy Spirit's empowerment and setting them apart for God's service. The oil's composition was unique and sacred, as described in <a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>. Anointing prefigures the anointing of Jesus by the Holy Spirit at His baptism and the anointing of believers in the New Covenant.<p><b>the bull of the sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a crucial part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement for sin and the need for purification. The bull, as a sin offering, foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the requirements of the Law and providing a way for humanity to be reconciled to God.<p><b>the two rams</b><br>The two rams were used for different purposes: one for the burnt offering and the other for the ordination offering. The burnt offering represented complete dedication to God, while the ordination offering signified the consecration of the priests. These sacrifices point to Christ's total obedience and His role in consecrating believers for service.<p><b>and the basket of unleavened bread</b><br>Unleavened bread, free from yeast, symbolizes purity and the absence of sin. It was part of the ordination ceremony, reflecting the need for holiness in those who serve God. This bread connects to the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which commemorate Israel's deliverance from Egypt and point to Christ, the Bread of Life, who is without sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, chosen by God to be the first high priest of Israel.
