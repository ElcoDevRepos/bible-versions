The "breasts" were part of the peace offering, which was a communal meal shared between the priests and the offerer, symbolizing fellowship with God. The act of placing these parts on the breasts signifies the separation of portions meant for the priests, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>. This practice highlights the provision for the priesthood and the importance of sharing in the sacrificial meal, which prefigures the communal aspect of the Lord's Supper in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>).<p><b>Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,</b><br>The burning of the fat portions on the altar was a critical part of the sacrificial process. In ancient Israelite culture, the fat was considered the best part of the animal and was reserved for God, symbolizing the offering of the best to the Lord. This act of burning the fat was a pleasing aroma to God, as mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>. The altar, located in the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice, representing God's presence among His people. The burning of the fat portions can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He offered Himself wholly to God, fulfilling the sacrificial system and providing a way for humanity to be reconciled to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is overseeing the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, who is being consecrated as the high priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>They are being consecrated alongside Aaron to serve as priests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, witnessing the consecration ceremony and the offerings being made.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where the offerings are made, representing God's dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The detailed instructions followed by Moses and Aaron emphasize the importance of obedience to God's commands.

After Moses&#8217; careful instruction, the family presents sin, burnt, grain, and fellowship offerings &#8220;as the LORD had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7-10</a>). Verse 20 falls within the fellowship (peace) offering, which is shared between God, priest, and worshiper (see <a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3-5</a>; 7:28-34). The orderly handling of every piece highlights that nothing in worship is accidental; each detail has purpose and meaning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What Were the Fat Portions?</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;fat portions&#8221; were the richest inner fat&#8212;the &#8220;fat tail,&#8221; kidneys, and lobe of the liver (<a href="/leviticus/3-9.htm">Leviticus 3:9-10</a>; 4:8-10).<p>&#8226; God repeatedly claims this fat as His exclusive portion: &#8220;All the fat is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning it on the altar pictured giving God the very best, underscoring His supreme worth (<a href="/exodus/29-13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a> emphasizes &#8220;the finest wheat&#8221; and &#8220;the blood of grapes,&#8221; again illustrating that God deserves the choicest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why Place Them on the Breasts?</b><p>&#8226; The priests laid the fat on top of the animal&#8217;s breast (the chest meat) before carrying it to the altar (<a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-31</a>).<p>&#8211; This action visually separated God&#8217;s portion (fat) from the priest&#8217;s portion (breast).<p>&#8211; It taught that even the priestly share must first pass under God&#8217;s claim, reminding leaders that their provision flows from Him (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By physically placing one piece upon another, the priests dramatized the layered fellowship: God receives first honor, then the priest, and finally the worshiper (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron Burned the Fat on the Altar</b><p>&#8226; Aaron personally ignites the fat: &#8220;Aaron burned the fat on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a>).<p>&#8211; The smoke rising symbolizes the offering ascending to God as &#8220;a pleasing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Aaron&#8217;s active role confirms his acceptance as mediator; God&#8217;s fire later falls in approval (<a href="/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/51-19.htm">Psalm 51:19</a> speaks of God&#8217;s delight when &#8220;burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings&#8221; are rightly offered.<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a> looks back to priests who &#8220;offer sacrifices day after day,&#8221; all pointing forward to Christ who offered Himself once for all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A Picture for Our Worship Today</b><p>&#8226; God still deserves the &#8220;first and best.&#8221; We honor Him by surrendering our finest time, talents, and resources (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the layered offering, worship embraces fellowship:<p>&#8211; God is glorified,<p>&#8211; leaders are provided for,<p>&#8211; believers share together (<a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ has fulfilled the sacrificial system (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), yet <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> urges us to &#8220;present your bodies as a living sacrifice.&#8221; The principle remains: give God the choicest portions of our lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/9-20.htm">Leviticus 9:20</a> shows the priests carefully placing the choice inner fat&#8212;the LORD&#8217;s exclusive share&#8212;on the breast before Aaron burns it on the altar. The act teaches that God receives the best first, the priest receives his portion only after acknowledging God&#8217;s claim, and the worshiper shares in fellowship afterward.
