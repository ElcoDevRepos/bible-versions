The goat, as a sacrificial animal, was significant in various offerings, including sin offerings and peace offerings. Goats were common livestock in ancient Israel, making them accessible for offerings. The choice of a goat could symbolize the offerer's socio-economic status, as goats were less expensive than cattle. In the Day of Atonement ritual (Leviticus 16), goats played a crucial role, with one being sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat, symbolizing the removal of sin.<p><b>he is to present it</b><br>The act of presenting the offering signifies the worshiper's active participation in the sacrificial process. This presentation was a public declaration of faith and obedience to God's commandments. It also demonstrated the worshiper's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and their dependence on Him for atonement and blessing. The presentation of the offering was a precursor to the ritual acts performed by the priests, highlighting the cooperative nature of worship between the laity and the priesthood.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" indicates the sacredness of the act and the presence of God in the tabernacle, where the offerings were made. This location was central to Israelite worship, as it was considered the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Offering before the LORD emphasized the direct relationship between the worshiper and God, facilitated by the sacrificial system. It also foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who presented Himself before God as the perfect offering for sin, fulfilling the sacrificial system's requirements once and for all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the offering, representing the people of Israel who are seeking to maintain a right relationship with God through sacrificial offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, Yahweh, who established the sacrificial system as a means for His people to express worship, gratitude, and atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_goat.htm">The Goat</a></b><br>An animal used in the peace offering, symbolizing the offerer's desire for peace and fellowship with God.
