A receding hairline, as mentioned here, was a common condition and not necessarily associated with disease. The focus on physical appearance reflects the broader Levitical concern with purity and holiness, as seen throughout the book. This phrase indicates a specific condition that was not considered defiling, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between different types of physical ailments.<p><b>and he is bald on his forehead</b><br>Baldness, particularly on the forehead, was a natural occurrence and not uncommon in the ancient Near East. The cultural context of the time did not view baldness as a negative trait but rather as a normal part of aging. This distinction is crucial because it separates natural conditions from those that might indicate a contagious disease, such as leprosy. The priest's role was to ensure that the community remained ritually pure, and this required careful examination of various physical conditions.<p><b>he is still clean</b><br>The declaration of cleanliness is significant in the Levitical system, where being "clean" or "unclean" affected one's ability to participate in community and religious life. This phrase reassures individuals with a receding hairline or baldness that they remain ritually pure and can fully engage in worship and community activities. The concept of cleanliness here is not just about physical health but also about maintaining a state of holiness before God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the heart and inner purity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct
