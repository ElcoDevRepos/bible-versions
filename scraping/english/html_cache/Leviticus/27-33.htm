In the context of Leviticus, the Israelites were instructed to tithe their livestock, and this command ensured that the selection process was not influenced by human judgment. The idea is that all offerings, regardless of perceived value, are equally acceptable to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). It also underscores the concept of trust in God's provision, as the Israelites were to offer without discrimination.<p><b>and he shall not make any substitution</b><br>The prohibition against substitution highlights the importance of integrity in worship. Once an animal was designated as part of the tithe, it was to be given as is, without replacement. This rule prevented individuals from attempting to offer something of lesser value after initially selecting a better animal. It aligns with the biblical principle of giving God the first and best of what one has (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was offered without blemish or substitution (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>But if he does make a substitution</b><br>This clause acknowledges human nature and the possibility of disobedience. It serves as a warning and a deterrent against attempting to circumvent God's commands. The allowance for substitution, albeit with consequences, reflects God's understanding of human frailty and the need for clear guidelines in worship practices. It also points to the seriousness with which God views vows and offerings, as seen in other parts of Scripture (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>).<p><b>both the animal and its substitute shall become holy</b><br>This outcome underscores the sanctity of what is dedicated to God. Once an animal is designated as holy, its status cannot be revoked, and any attempt to substitute it results in both animals being consecrated. This principle reinforces the idea that what is given to God is set apart and cannot be reclaimed for common use. It mirrors the New Testament teaching that believers are to be living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>they cannot be redeemed.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The final phrase indicates the irrevocable nature of the consecration. Once an animal is dedicated, it cannot be bought back or exchanged, signifying the total commitment required in offerings to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where certain things, once given to God, are beyond human reclamation. It also prefigures the ultimate redemption through Christ, who paid the price for humanity's sins, a transaction that cannot be undone (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including the instructions on tithes and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who established the covenant with Israel and provided these laws to guide their worship and community life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tithing.htm">Tithing</a></b><br>The practice of giving a tenth of one's produce or livestock as an offering to God, as outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/substitution.htm">Substitution</a></b><br>The act of replacing one animal with another in the context of offerings, which is specifically addressed in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_holiness.htm">The Principle of Holiness</a></b><br>The verse underscores the holiness of what is dedicated to God.
