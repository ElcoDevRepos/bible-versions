The horns, located at the four corners of the altar, symbolize strength and power. This ritual act underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for divine forgiveness. The blood represents life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>) and serves as a substitute for the sinner's life, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the remission of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was where God's presence dwelled among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes the sacredness of the act and the direct accountability to God. This setting foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the true Tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), dwelling among humanity.<p><b>and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering</b><br>Pouring the remaining blood at the base of the altar signifies the complete offering of life to God. The altar of burnt offering, located in the courtyard of the Tabernacle, was where sacrifices were made to atone for sin. This act of pouring out the blood symbolizes total surrender and dedication to God, prefiguring Christ's complete sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The entrance to the Tent of Meeting was a place of transition from the common to the holy. It was where the Israelites would bring their offerings and seek reconciliation with God. This location highlights the accessibility of God to His people through prescribed means.

In <a href="/bsb/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4</a> the priest acts on behalf of a sinning community. By taking &#8220;some&#8221; of the victim&#8217;s blood, he demonstrates that even one drop is precious enough to secure atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This portion is set apart, reminding Israel that God graciously accepts a substitute. Compare the Passover lamb&#8217;s blood applied to the doorposts (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7</a>) and the daily offerings (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;4</a>), each underscoring that salvation always rests on sacrificial blood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the horns of the altar</b><p>The &#8220;horns&#8221; project from the altar&#8217;s corners (<a href="/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>). Horns symbolize strength and refuge; fugitives clung to them for mercy (<a href="/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). By daubing blood here, the priest publicly displays that guilt has been confronted at the place of divine power. The altar of incense (<a href="/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1&#8211;10</a>) shares this practice on the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-18.htm">Leviticus 16:18&#8211;19</a>), showing continuity: whether for daily sin or annual cleansing, God&#8217;s power is engaged through blood.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting</b><p>This altar stands just outside the veil, &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>), so the act occurs in God&#8217;s immediate presence. The Tent of Meeting is where God promised, &#8220;There I will meet with you&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a>). Sin must be resolved in proximity to His holiness; distance will not do. Moses spoke face-to-face there (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9&#8211;11</a>), foreshadowing how Christ brings us near (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering</b><p>Nothing is wasted. The bulk is &#8220;poured out,&#8221; a vivid picture of total surrender (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>). The bronze altar received every other sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>), so this sin offering joins the continual stream of worship. By reaching the ground, the blood permeates the place where the people stand, declaring them cleansed (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13&#8211;14</a>). Compare the ordination of priests when blood was likewise poured out (<a href="/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>), linking ministry and forgiveness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>This happens where Israel gathers (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). The doorway marks transition from common space to holy precinct; the blood testifies that sinners may now approach (<a href="/psalms/65-4.htm">Psalm 65:4</a>). Later, Jesus describes Himself as &#8220;the door&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). By fulfilling every sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>), He invites us to step across that threshold with confidence, just as cleansed Israelites once did.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-18.htm">Leviticus 4:18</a> pictures a twofold movement of sacrificial blood: a deliberate application to the altar&#8217;s horns, and a complete outpouring at its base. Together they declare that God&#8217;s power embraces substitutionary death and that every drop is devoted to removing guilt. Placed before the LORD yet visible to the congregation, the act turns a sinner&#8217;s offense into restored fellowship. In Christ, the ultimate offering, this ancient pattern finds its perfect and everlasting fulfillment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He is also to apply</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;
