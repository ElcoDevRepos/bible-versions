The descendants of Aaron were set apart for priestly duties, and any physical defect disqualified them from performing certain sacred functions. This requirement underscores the holiness and perfection expected in those who serve God, reflecting the perfection of God Himself. In the broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type pointing to Jesus Christ, the perfect High Priest, who was without blemish or defect (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>).<p><b>shall approach to present the food offerings to the LORD.</b><br>The food offerings, also known as grain offerings, were a significant part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing the dedication of the fruits of labor to God. The priest's role in presenting these offerings was crucial, as it represented the people's worship and devotion. The restriction on those with defects highlights the need for purity and holiness in worship, a theme that runs throughout Leviticus. This also foreshadows the ultimate offering of Christ, who presented Himself as the perfect sacrifice to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>Since he has a defect,</b><br>The repetition of the term "defect" emphasizes the importance of physical integrity in the priestly service. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical perfection was often associated with divine favor and suitability for religious roles. This requirement served as a constant reminder of the need for holiness and the separation from anything that might symbolize imperfection or sin.<p><b>he is not to come near to offer the food of his God.</b><br>The prohibition against approaching to offer the food of God underscores the sanctity of the priestly office and the offerings themselves. The phrase "food of his God" refers to the offerings that were considered as God's portion, symbolizing His provision and sustenance. This restriction serves as a reminder of the reverence due to God and the seriousness of approaching Him in worship. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who, as the sinless High Priest, offers believers access to God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and ancestor of the Levitical priesthood.

Hence, during the second Temple, the authorities registered no less than one hundred and forty-two defects which disqualify the priest for serving at the altar. There was a chamber in the court of the Temple in which the Sanhedrim examined all the priests prior to their being received into the staff of those who officiated in the sanctuary. At the conclusion of this periodical examination, all the priests were divided into two classes. Those who were pronounced physically disqualified "put on black garments, wrapped themselves up in black cloaks, and went away in silence"; whilst those who were declared qualified put on white garments and white cloaks, and forthwith joined their brethren to assist in the sacred office. They celebrated the day by giving a feast to all their friends, which they opened with the following benediction: "Blessed be the Lord! Blessed be He because no blemish hath been found in the seed of Aaron, the priest; and blessed be He because He hath chosen Aaron and his sons to stand and to serve before the Lord in His most holy sanctuary." Those priests who were declared physically unfit, were employed in the chamber for wood at the north-east of the court of the women, to select the proper wood for the altar, since any piece which was worm-eaten could not be burnt on it. (See <a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm" title="And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire:">Leviticus 1:7</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/21-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">descendant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1433;&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(miz&#183;ze&#183;ra&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
