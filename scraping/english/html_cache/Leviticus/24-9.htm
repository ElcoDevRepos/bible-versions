Aaron, as the first high priest, and his sons, representing the Levitical priesthood, were set apart for service to God. This allocation underscores the principle of provision for those who serve in the temple, as seen in <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-10</a>, where the priests are given portions of the offerings. The priesthood's sustenance from the offerings symbolizes their dependence on God and their role as mediators between God and Israel.<p><b>who are to eat it in a holy place</b><br>The requirement to eat in a holy place, likely the tabernacle or later the temple, emphasizes the sanctity of the bread and the act of consumption. This restriction highlights the separation between the sacred and the profane, a recurring theme in Leviticus. Eating in a holy place signifies the priests' participation in the holiness of God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16</a>, where similar instructions are given for other offerings.<p><b>for it is to him a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD</b><br>The designation "most holy" indicates the highest level of sanctity, reserved for offerings that are directly associated with the divine presence. This status is shared with other offerings like the sin and guilt offerings (<a href="/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25, 7</a>:1). The bread of the Presence, as a perpetual offering, symbolizes God's continual provision and presence with His people, prefiguring Christ as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>his portion forever</b><br>The term "forever" signifies the perpetual nature of this ordinance, reflecting the eternal covenant between God and the priesthood. This enduring provision points to the unchanging nature of God's promises and His faithfulness.

By granting a tangible portion, the LORD provides for those who serve at the altar (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>). The wording also underscores exclusivity&#8212;no priest outside Aaron&#8217;s line and no layperson may partake (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who are to eat it in a holy place</b><p>The bread&#8217;s destination is more than a dinner table; it is the sanctuary precinct (<a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>a).

Items in the latter category are restricted to priests and demand special handling.
