The fat, considered the best part of the animal, was reserved for God, symbolizing the offering of the best to Him. This act of burning the fat was a way to honor God and acknowledge His holiness. The altar, located in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple, was the central place of worship and sacrifice, representing God's presence among His people. The burning of fat also served as a reminder of the need for purity and dedication in worship.<p><b>like the fat of the peace offerings</b><br>The peace offerings, or fellowship offerings, were sacrifices that symbolized reconciliation and communion with God. They were voluntary offerings expressing gratitude and fellowship. By comparing the sin offering to the peace offerings, the text emphasizes the importance of restoring a right relationship with God. The peace offerings were unique in that they allowed the offerer to partake in the meal, symbolizing shared fellowship with God. This connection highlights the communal aspect of worship and the restoration of peace between the sinner and God.<p><b>thus the priest will make atonement for that man&#8217;s sin</b><br>The role of the priest was crucial in the atonement process. As a mediator between God and the people, the priest performed the sacrificial rites to atone for sin. Atonement involved covering or cleansing sin, allowing the individual to be reconciled with God. This process foreshadowed the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who, as the perfect High Priest, offered Himself as the final sacrifice for sin. The priest's actions in the Old Testament were a type of Christ's redemptive work on the cross.<p><b>and he will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness was the ultimate goal of the sacrificial system, providing the sinner with a restored relationship with God. This forgiveness was not merely a legal pardon but a relational restoration, allowing the individual to continue in covenant fellowship with God. The assurance of forgiveness pointed to the grace and mercy of God, who provided a means for His people to be cleansed from sin. This concept of forgiveness is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice offers complete and eternal forgiveness for all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, performing the sacrificial rituals necessary for atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices are made, symbolizing the presence of God and the means by which atonement is achieved.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of sacrifice in the Old Testament designed to atone for unintentional sins and restore the sinner to a right relationship with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A voluntary sacrifice expressing thanksgiving and fellowship with God, from which the fat is burned in the sin offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process by which reconciliation between God and humanity is achieved, often through the shedding of blood in the Old Testament context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>The priest's role in making atonement foreshadows Christ's ultimate priesthood, where He intercedes for us and offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_sacrifice.htm">The Significance of Sacrifice</a></b><br>Sacrifices in the Old Testament point to the seriousness of sin and the need for a substitute.
