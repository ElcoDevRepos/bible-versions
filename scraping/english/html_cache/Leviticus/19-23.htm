The act of planting trees for food signifies settling and establishing a permanent presence in the land. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, planting trees was a sign of prosperity and long-term investment. The command to plant "any kind of tree for food" indicates the variety and abundance God intended for His people, reflecting His provision and blessing.<p><b>you shall regard the fruit as forbidden</b><br>The term "forbidden" here is translated from the Hebrew word "arel," which means uncircumcised. This metaphorical use implies that the fruit is not yet consecrated or fit for consumption. The concept of something being "uncircumcised" is significant in the Hebrew tradition, as circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people. Thus, the fruit is not yet part of the covenant blessings until a period of consecration has passed.<p><b>For three years it will be forbidden to you and must not be eaten</b><br>The three-year period of waiting before consuming the fruit is a time of maturation and dedication. This practice can be seen as a form of firstfruits offering, where the initial yield is dedicated to God. The number three often symbolizes completeness and preparation in the Bible, as seen in the three days Jesus spent in the tomb. This waiting period teaches patience and reliance on God's timing, emphasizing that the land and its produce ultimately belong to Him. The practice also ensures that the trees are healthy and capable of producing good fruit in the future, reflecting God's concern for sustainable stewardship of the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the Levitical laws, including the instructions in <a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23</a>, were the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
