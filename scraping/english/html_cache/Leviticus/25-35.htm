The Mosaic Law provided guidelines for the community to support those in need, reflecting God's concern for justice and compassion. The term "countryman" emphasizes the covenant relationship among the Israelites, who were bound by shared faith and heritage. This reflects the broader biblical principle of caring for one's neighbor, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>.<p><b>and cannot support himself among you</b><br>The inability to support oneself indicates a severe level of poverty. In ancient Israel, this could result from various factors such as crop failure, illness, or economic downturns. The communal nature of Israelite society meant that individual well-being was tied to the community's health. This phrase underscores the importance of social responsibility and mutual aid, which are echoed in the New Testament teachings of bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>then you are to help him</b><br>This command is a direct call to action, emphasizing the moral obligation to assist those in need. The Hebrew concept of "help" here involves more than just financial aid; it includes providing opportunities for the destitute to regain stability and dignity. This aligns with the biblical theme of mercy and justice, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>as you would a foreigner or stranger</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners and strangers highlights the inclusive nature of God's law. While Israelites had a special covenant relationship with God, they were also called to extend kindness to non-Israelites living among them. This reflects God's impartiality and foreshadows the New Testament message of the gospel being for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The treatment of foreigners is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing hospitality and fairness (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>).<p><b>so that he can continue to live among you</b><br>The goal of this command is the preservation of community and the prevention of social fragmentation. By ensuring that the destitute can continue to live among them, the Israelites maintained the integrity and unity of their society. This principle is mirrored in the New Testament church's practice of sharing resources to meet the needs of all members (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). The phrase also points to the sustaining power of God's provision, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the Levitical laws, including the instructions in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, were the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were to live according to His commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destitute_brother.htm">The Destitute Brother</a></b><br>This refers to any fellow Israelite who has fallen into poverty and is unable to sustain himself, highlighting the community's responsibility to care for one another.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners_and_strangers.htm">Foreigners and Strangers</a></b><br>These were non-Israelites living among the Israelites, who were also to be treated with kindness and support, reflecting God's inclusive care.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The context of these laws is the land of Canaan, which God promised to the Israelites, where they were to live out His commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws and commandments to the Israelites, including the instructions in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the importance of community support and responsibility.

As the laws of jubile guard the future interests of the Israelite who is driven by stress of poverty to sell his patrimony, the Lawgiver now points out the duties of each member of the community to the impoverished brother who has to wait till the year of jubile for the restoration of his property, but who in the meantime is unable to support himself.<p><span class= "bld">Then thou shalt relieve him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">thou shalt lay hold of him. </span>When his hand is thus trembling, it is the duty of every Israelite to support his weak hand, and enable it to gain a livelihood.<p><span class= "bld">Though he be a stranger, or a sojourner.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as a stranger and a sojourner, </span>that is, he is not to be treated like an outcast because he has been compelled by poverty to sell his patrimony, but is to receive the same consideration which strangers and sojourners receive, who, like the unfortunate Israelite, have no landed property. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/19-33.htm" title="And if a stranger sojourn with you in your land, you shall not vex him.">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-38.</span> - Slavery. It is presumed that no Hebrew will become a slave except on the pressure of poverty, and this poverty his brethren are commanded to relieve; but foreseeing that either want of charity on the part of the rich or unthrift on the part of the poor would certainly bring about slavery, the legislator makes regulations so as to soften its character as far as possible. The literal translation of verse 35 is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth by thee, thou shalt lay hold of him; a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee.</span> The translation of the latter clause adopted by the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner</span>; <span class="accented">that he may live with thee</span>, makes the duty of giving charitable support and loans of money to apply to the case of the stranger and sojourner as well as of the Israelite. The other and more probable rendering confines its application to native Israelites. <span class="accented">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth, thou shalt support him as a stranger or a sojourner</span>, that is, treat him with the forbearance shown to resident foreigners, to whose state he had reduced himself by the loss of his land. The command in verse 36, <span class="cmt_word">Take thou no usury of him, or increase,</span> does not bear upon the general question of taking interest for money when lent to wealthy men or companies for business purposes. It simply forbids the taking of interest or increase of a brother Israelite who had become poor. The history of Rome shows how much cruelty and revolution such an injunction may have prevented. The words, <span class="accented">or increase</span>, added to <span class="accented">usury</span>, forbid the exaction of any greater quantity of food or clothing (a method of evading the law against usury) than that which had been lent. The injunction was transgressed in the time of Nehemiah, when "he rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.... Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer" (<a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7, 8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
