Swearing falsely was not only a breach of trust between individuals but also an offense against God, who was invoked in the oath. The commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>) underscores the importance of truthfulness. In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of honesty in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, urging His followers to let their "yes" be "yes" and their "no" be "no."<p><b>He must make restitution in full,</b><br>Restitution was a key component of justice in the Mosaic Law, reflecting God's desire for restoration and reconciliation. The requirement to make restitution in full ensured that the wronged party was compensated completely for their loss. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Zacchaeus, upon his conversion, promises to repay fourfold anyone he has defrauded (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p><b>add a fifth of the value,</b><br>The addition of a fifth (20%) to the restitution amount served as a penalty and a deterrent against dishonesty. This extra payment acknowledged the inconvenience and potential harm caused by the wrongdoing. The concept of adding a fifth is also seen in <a href="/leviticus/27-31.htm">Leviticus 27:31</a> regarding tithes, indicating a consistent principle in the law for compensatory justice.<p><b>and pay it to the owner</b><br>The directive to pay the restitution directly to the owner emphasizes personal responsibility and the restoration of relationships. This personal transaction would have reinforced community bonds and accountability. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects God's justice, which is not only punitive but also restorative.<p><b>on the day he acknowledges his guilt.</b><br>Immediate restitution upon acknowledgment of guilt highlights the importance of prompt repentance and reconciliation. This urgency is mirrored in the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who stresses the importance of resolving disputes quickly (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>). The acknowledgment of guilt and subsequent restitution can be seen as a type of confession and repentance, which are central themes in the Christian understanding of salvation and forgiveness through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including those in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, forming the covenant community of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_offering.htm">Guilt Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering in the Levitical law required for atonement of certain sins, particularly those involving deceit or unintentional wrongdoing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where offerings were presented, serving as the dwelling place of God among His people during their wilderness journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restitution.htm">Restitution</a></b><br>The act of making amends for wrongs committed, a key component of the law in <a href="/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truthfulness.htm">The Importance of Truthfulness</a></b><br>God values honesty and integrity.

Besides this, the offender is to add a fifth part of the principal, to compensate for the loss which the owner sustained during the interval. It will be seen that in <a href="/context/exodus/22-1.htm" title="If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.">Exodus 22:1-9</a>, when a person was guilty of any of the offences here specified, the offender was condemned to make a four fold restitution, whilst in the passage before us the mulct is reduced to the restitution of the principal with the addition of a fifth part. The reason of this difference is that the law in Exodus deals with a culprit who is convicted of his crime in a court of justice by means of witnesses, whilst the law before us deals with an offender who, through compunction of mind, voluntarily confesses his offence, and to whom, without this voluntary confession, the offence could not be brought home. It is this difference which constitutes it a case for a trespass offering. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm" title="Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.">Numbers 5:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In the day of his trespass offering.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">on the day of his guilt. </span>That is, as soon as he acknowledges his guilt, and brings the sacrifice for his offence, he is to make the requisite restitution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day of his trespass offering is a better rendering</span> than that of the margin, "in the day of his being found guilty," or" in the day of his trespass."
