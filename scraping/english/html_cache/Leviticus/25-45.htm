These individuals were often traders, laborers, or those who had settled in the land for various reasons. The allowance to purchase foreigners as servants reflects the socio-economic structures of the time, where servitude was a common practice across many cultures. This practice is not an endorsement of slavery as understood in modern terms but rather a regulated form of servitude with specific protections and rights outlined in the Mosaic Law. The Israelites were reminded of their own history as foreigners in Egypt, which influenced the ethical treatment of servants (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>).<p><b>or their clans living among you who are born in your land</b><br>The mention of "clans" indicates extended family groups of foreigners who had settled in Israel. Being "born in your land" suggests a level of integration into the community, though they remained distinct from the covenant people of Israel. This distinction is important in understanding the social hierarchy and legal status within Israel. The inclusion of these individuals in the economic system of Israel reflects the broader principle of hospitality and provision for those who are not part of the covenant community, as seen in the laws concerning the treatment of sojourners (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>).<p><b>These may become your property</b><br>The concept of property in this context is tied to the economic and social systems of the ancient Near East. Servitude was often a means of survival for foreigners and their families, providing them with protection and sustenance. The term "property" does not imply ownership in the modern sense but rather a legal and economic responsibility. The Israelites were commanded to treat their servants with dignity and respect, as outlined in various laws that provided for their welfare and eventual release (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and mercy, which is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who came to proclaim liberty to the captives (<a
