The leper's cleansing process culminates on this day, symbolizing a complete restoration to the community and to God.<p><b>he is to bring</b><br>The act of bringing offerings indicates personal responsibility and active participation in one's own purification process. It reflects the principle that while God provides the means for cleansing, the individual must respond in obedience and faith.<p><b>two unblemished male lambs</b><br>The requirement for unblemished lambs underscores the importance of purity and perfection in offerings to God.

The specific measure, three-tenths of an ephah, indicates a substantial offering, reflecting the seriousness of the cleansing process.

The leper, once isolated, now stands anointed for covenant life and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10</a> details the precise, costly gifts a healed leper brings on day eight. Each element&#8212;spotless lambs, pure flour, and abundant oil&#8212;declares that cleansing is God&#8217;s work, but restored fellowship still moves the worshiper to offer the best. The passage ultimately points ahead to Jesus, the flawless Lamb whose sacrifice and anointing secure both purification and Spirit-filled consecration for all who come to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And on the eighth day.</span>--Though restored to social intercourse with his fellow brethren, the recovered leper could not at once be admitted to the privileges of the sanctuary, but had to bring on the eighth day three kinds of sacrifices: viz., a trespass offering, a sin offering, and a burnt offering. The lamb for the sin offering had not only to be without blemish (see <a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a>), but of the first year (see <a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm" title="And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest:">Leviticus 12:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And three tenth deals of fine flour.</span>--Each of these three sacrifices is to be accompanied by a meat offering, consisting of a tenth part of an ephah (which is an omer) of flour. The omer, which is the same as "the tenth deal" (see <a href="/exodus/16-36.htm" title="Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.">Exodus 16:36</a>), as it is here called, is equal to 43? eggs, or about four pints. Ordinarily a meat offering did not accompany the trespass offering or the sin offering, and only one omer was brought with a lamb (see <a href="/numbers/15-4.htm" title="Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.">Numbers 15:4</a>); but according to the administrators of the law during the second Temple, three omers are here prescribed as a substitute for the drink offering which should have accompanied the two expiatory sacrifices. For the manner in which the meat offering was prepared, see <a href="/context/leviticus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,">Leviticus 11:1-4</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour.</span> Every sacrifice is to be provided and offered by the restored leper, except the peace offering. It is certainly singular that the peace offering should be omitted, and that the trespass offering should be required. The former fact may be accounted for by the supposition that though the peace offering was not required, the late leper was, after his other sacrifices, put in a position where he might offer it when he would of his own free will. But the requirement of the trespass offering is more difficult to explain. What wrong had the leper done? and what satisfaction had he to make? The usual answer to this question is that he had wronged Jehovah in that, however involuntarily, he had failed to bring him the offerings and service which he would have brought had he not been excluded from the camp. But this is a very forced explanation, and it is incompatible with other parts of the Law. For the leper was not the only unclean person who, owing to his uncleanness, was prevented from offering his gifts and worship at the tabernacle or temple. The woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years (<a href="/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43</a>) during that time would have been excluded from the sanctuary. But no trespass offering is required of those that have been unclean through issues. We must therefore, look for some other explanation of the requirement in the case of the cleansed leper. And a simpler one is at hand. Leprosy was the type of sin - or all sin whatsoever. When, therefore, the expiatory sacrifices were demanded, both kinds - the trespass offering and the sin offering - had to be offered, because expiation had to be made for the uncleanness which represented all unrighteousness - trespasses as well as sins. It might be that the man had not committed a trespass; he might also not hive committed sin; but he had been stricken with the foul disease which symbolized both one and the other, and therefore he had to offer on his cleansing the sacrifice appropriate to each. There is a difference in the ritual of the trespass offering in the present ease, intended perhaps to distinguish it from those trespass offerings which were made when a man had in his mind a certain wrong or injury which he had committed, and for which he wished to make compensation. On this occasion <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the animal presented was not required to be of a particular value, as in the ordinary trespass offerings; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it was waved, whereas the ordinary trespass offerings were not waved; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it was waved by the priest, whereas other wave offerings were waved not by the priest, but by the offerer, whose bands were guided by the priests.
