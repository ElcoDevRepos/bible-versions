This includes contact with certain animals, bodily discharges, or corpses. The concept of cleanliness was central to the Israelites' covenant relationship with God, symbolizing holiness and separation from sin. The idea of ritual purity is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live holy lives (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>whether human uncleanness</b><br>Human uncleanness could arise from various conditions, such as skin diseases (Leviticus 13-14) or bodily discharges (Leviticus 15). These laws emphasized the need for spiritual and physical purity among the Israelites. The New Testament reflects this concern for purity, urging believers to cleanse themselves from all defilement of body and spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>).<p><b>an unclean animal</b><br>Certain animals were deemed unclean and not fit for consumption or contact (Leviticus 11). This distinction between clean and unclean animals served to set Israel apart from other nations and to teach them about holiness. In <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, Peter's vision of clean and unclean animals is used to illustrate the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant, showing the fulfillment of these laws in Christ.<p><b>or any unclean, detestable thing</b><br>The term "detestable" often refers to idolatrous practices or objects associated with pagan worship. The Israelites were to avoid such things to maintain their covenant purity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God, as seen in the warnings against idolatry throughout the Old and New Testaments (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>).<p><b>and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD</b><br>The peace offering was a communal meal shared between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving. Eating the offering while in a state of uncleanness desecrated this sacred act. This highlights the importance of approaching God with reverence and purity, a principle reiterated in the New Testament regarding the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-27.htm">1 Corinthians 11:27-29</a>).<p><b>that person must be cut off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" could mean excommunication or even death, depending on the severity of the offense. This severe consequence underscores the seriousness of maintaining holiness and obedience to God's commands. It foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that sin causes, which is reconciled through Christ's atoning sacrifice, offering believers eternal fellowship with God (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the Levitical laws, called to be a holy nation set apart for God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Mediators between God and the people, responsible for teaching and enforcing the laws of cleanliness and offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peace_offering.htm">The Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Levitical system symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_creatures.htm">Unclean Creatures</a></b><br>Animals or swarming creatures considered impure according to Levitical law, which could defile a person.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who established these laws to maintain holiness among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be distinct and separate from impurity.

Touching what God labels unclean brought ceremonial defilement (see <a href="/leviticus/5-2.htm">Leviticus 5:2 and 22</a>:3&#8211;6). The principle is simple: God&#8217;s presence demands purity, and He defines what purity is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Human uncleanness</b><p>The verse first lists &#8220;human uncleanness.&#8221; That covers bodily discharges, disease, and contact with the dead (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>). These regulations reminded Israel that everyday life can contaminate worship. Even today, <a href="/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a> calls believers to &#8220;purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit,&#8221; echoing the same heart concern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An unclean animal</b><p>Next comes &#8220;an unclean animal.&#8221; <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> catalogues animals Israel could not eat or touch when dead. Contact with them symbolized fellowship with what God had pronounced unfit. The New Testament affirms that God once used these categories to teach separation (<a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a> recalls Peter&#8217;s hesitation). The spiritual takeaway remains: do not handle what God calls unholy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Any unclean, detestable thing</b><p>The phrase broadens to &#8220;any unclean, detestable thing,&#8221; sweeping in objects associated with idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). God&#8217;s people were to reject every form of impurity, whether obvious or subtle. <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a> applies the same standard&#8212;&#8220;Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD</b><p>The peace (fellowship) offering was unique: worshipers shared a meal with God, family, and friends (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; 7:15-18). Eating this sacred meat while defiled mocked the very fellowship it celebrated. Paul echoes the warning in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.&#8221; Accepting God&#8217;s hospitality requires clean hands and a pure heart (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That person must be cut off from his people</b><p>The consequence is severe: &#8220;that person must be cut off from his people.&#8221; Being &#8220;cut off&#8221; meant exclusion from the covenant community and its blessings (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>). God defends His holiness for the good of the whole camp. In the New Testament, <a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28-30</a> shows the same seriousness&#8212;some in Corinth suffered illness and death for treating the Lord&#8217;s Supper lightly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-21.htm">Leviticus 7:21</a> teaches that approaching God casually, while clinging to defilement, is unacceptable. Israel had to avoid every source of impurity&#8212;personal, animal, or object&#8212;before sharing in the peace offering. The principle endures: God invites His people to joyful fellowship, but that fellowship requires separation from what He calls unclean and wholehearted respect for His holiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/7-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1436;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ne&#183;p&#772;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
