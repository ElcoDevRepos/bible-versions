The fat, kidneys, and liver lobe were considered the choicest parts, symbolizing the best being offered to God. This practice highlights the importance of giving God the best of what one has, a principle seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). The burning of these parts also signifies the complete consumption of the offering, representing the total surrender and atonement for sin. The altar, central to the tabernacle, was where sacrifices were made, symbolizing the meeting place between God and man. This foreshadows Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He offered Himself completely for the atonement of humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. The detailed instructions given to Moses for the sacrificial system were not arbitrary but were divinely ordained to teach Israel about holiness, sin, and redemption. The adherence to these commands reflects a heart of obedience and reverence towards God. This obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, where blessings are often tied to following God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The meticulous following of God's instructions by Moses and Aaron serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), demonstrating complete obedience to the Father (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments.
