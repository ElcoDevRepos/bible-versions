In the context of Leviticus, it suggests a deviation from the expected outcome of a cleansing ritual. The use of "if" highlights the uncertainty and variability in the condition of skin diseases, which were a significant concern in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>the scaly outbreak</b><br>The term "scaly outbreak" refers to a skin condition that is visibly spreading and potentially infectious. In the ancient Near East, skin diseases were not only a health concern but also a matter of ritual purity. The Hebrew term used here can encompass a range of skin conditions, not limited to what modern medicine would classify as leprosy. The focus is on the visible symptoms and their implications for community and worship.<p><b>spreads further on the skin</b><br>The spreading of the condition is a critical factor in determining the person's status. In Levitical law, the spread of a skin disease could render a person ritually unclean, affecting their ability to participate in community and religious life. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity and holiness, where physical conditions often symbolize spiritual realities.<p><b>after his cleansing,</b><br>Cleansing rituals were an essential part of maintaining purity in Israelite society. These rituals, detailed in Leviticus, involved specific sacrifices and procedures to restore a person to a state of ritual cleanliness. The mention of "after his cleansing" indicates that the person had previously been declared clean, but the recurrence or spread of the disease necessitates further examination. This reflects the ongoing need for vigilance and the potential for relapse, paralleling the spiritual vigilance required in maintaining holiness before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest plays a crucial role in diagnosing and declaring someone clean or unclean.
