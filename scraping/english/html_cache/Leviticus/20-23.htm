The "statutes of the nations" refers to the pagan practices and idolatrous customs prevalent among the Canaanites and other peoples inhabiting the Promised Land. These practices often included child sacrifice, sexual immorality, and various forms of idol worship, which were detestable to God. The command to avoid these statutes underscores the call to holiness found throughout Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The Israelites were to be a holy nation, set apart for God's purposes, reflecting His character and laws. This separation from pagan practices is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live distinctively from the world (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm">1 Peter 1:14-16</a>).<p><b>Because they did all these things, I abhorred them.</b><br>The phrase "I abhorred them" indicates God's intense displeasure and rejection of the nations' sinful practices. The Hebrew word used here conveys a strong sense of loathing and rejection. This divine abhorrence is not arbitrary but is based on the moral corruption and abominations committed by these nations. The historical context reveals that the Canaanites engaged in practices that were not only religiously offensive but also morally reprehensible, such as ritual prostitution and child sacrifice (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). God's judgment upon these nations serves as a warning and a demonstration of His holiness and justice. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment against sin and the establishment of God's kingdom, where righteousness will dwell (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>). The call for Israel to avoid these practices is a type of the call for Christians to live in purity and righteousness, reflecting the holiness of Christ, who fulfilled the law and calls His followers to a higher standard of living (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to live in a way that is distinct from the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Canaanite nations that inhabited the Promised Land before the Israelites.
