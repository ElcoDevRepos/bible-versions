Only the high priest could enter this space, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This act of atonement was necessary to cleanse the sanctuary from the defilement caused by the sins of the people. The high priest's actions prefigure the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who entered the heavenly sanctuary once for all, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>.<p><b>because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites</b><br>The impurities refer to both ceremonial uncleanness and moral transgressions. Rebellious acts highlight the willful disobedience of the Israelites against God's commandments. This phrase underscores the need for atonement due to the pervasive nature of sin, which affects not only individuals but also the community and the sacred space itself. The sacrificial system was a temporary measure pointing to the need for a perfect and final atonement.<p><b>in regard to all their sins</b><br>This comprehensive phrase indicates that the atonement covered all types of sins, whether intentional or unintentional. It reflects the holistic nature of the sacrificial system, which aimed to restore the relationship between God and His people. The concept of sin in the Old Testament includes both actions and the inherent sinful nature of humanity, which is ultimately addressed through the sacrifice of Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23-25</a>.<p><b>He is to do the same for the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. It was the center of worship and the place where God communicated with Moses and the priests. The need for atonement for the Tent of Meeting signifies that even the place of divine encounter required purification due to the presence of sin. This foreshadows the cleansing work of Christ, who purifies not only individuals but also the community of believers, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>.<p><b>which abides among them in the midst of their impurities</b><br>God's presence among the Israelites, despite their impurities, highlights His grace and desire for relationship with His people. The Tabernacle was a constant reminder of God's holiness and the need for His people to be holy. This abiding presence is fulfilled in the New Testament through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>, emphasizing that God dwells with His people even amidst their imperfections.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_priest.htm">High Priest</a></b><br>The central figure in the Day of Atonement rituals, responsible for making atonement for the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/most_holy_place.htm">Most Holy Place</a></b><br>The innermost part of the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt, and where the High Priest entered once a year to make atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whose sins and impurities necessitated the atonement process.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The Tabernacle, a portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>An annual event where the High Priest made atonement for the sins of the people and the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>Sin creates a barrier between humanity and God, necessitating a means of reconciliation.

There remained the outer chamber of the tabernacle and the altar of burnt sacrifice to be atoned for. Accordingly, the high priest proceeds to do <span class="cmt_word">so for the tabernacle of the congregation,</span> that is, to make a similar atonement by similar means outside the vail as he had made inside it. He would therefore have made one sprinkling with the blood upon the vail, and seven sprinklings before it, after which he placed the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense, according to the command given in <a href="/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>.
