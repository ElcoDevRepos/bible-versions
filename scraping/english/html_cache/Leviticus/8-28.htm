The items taken from their hands refer to the portions of the sacrifice that were part of the ordination ceremony for Aaron and his sons. This act signifies the transfer of the offering from the priests to God, highlighting Moses' role as a leader and intermediary. This mirrors the role of Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>and burned them on the altar with the burnt offering.</b><br>Burning on the altar signifies complete dedication to God, as the burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire. This act symbolizes the total surrender and consecration of the priests to their divine service. The altar, central to Israelite worship, represents the place where God meets His people. This foreshadows Christ's sacrifice, where He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>This was an ordination offering,</b><br>The ordination offering, or "filling of the hands," was a unique sacrifice marking the consecration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood. This ceremony set them apart for holy service, emphasizing the importance of purity and dedication in serving God. The ordination process underscores the necessity of divine appointment and preparation for spiritual leadership, paralleling the calling and anointing of Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>).<p><b>a pleasing aroma,</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" indicates God's acceptance of the offering. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the aroma of sacrifices was believed to ascend to the deity, signifying divine satisfaction. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), symbolizing His perfect obedience and the acceptance of His atoning work.<p><b>a food offering to the LORD.</b><br>The term "food offering" reflects the idea of providing sustenance or satisfaction to God, though not in a literal sense. It signifies the relational aspect of worship, where offerings are a means of fellowship and communion with God. This concept is fulfilled in Christ, who is the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering spiritual nourishment and eternal life to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.
