In the ancient Near Eastern context, servitude was common, but God distinguishes His people by claiming them as His own servants. This reflects the covenant relationship established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), where Israel is called a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation." The concept of being God's servants implies a special calling and purpose, setting them apart from other nations.<p><b>whom I brought out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This reference to the Exodus is a reminder of God's redemptive power and faithfulness. The deliverance from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation from bondage and the beginning of a new identity as a free people under God's rule. It serves as a continual reminder of God's sovereignty and grace. The Exodus is frequently recalled throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-11.htm">Psalm 136:11-12</a>) as a demonstration of God's love and commitment to His people.<p><b>they are not to be sold as slaves</b><br>This command underscores the dignity and freedom that God intends for His people. In contrast to the surrounding cultures where slavery was a permanent and often harsh condition, God institutes laws to protect the Israelites from such treatment. This reflects the principle of justice and mercy inherent in God's law. The prohibition against selling Israelites as slaves is a safeguard against exploitation and a reminder of their unique status as God's servants. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live as free people, not enslaved by sin (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He delivered from slavery in Egypt.
