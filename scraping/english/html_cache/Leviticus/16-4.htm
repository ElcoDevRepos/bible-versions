In the context of <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, this attire was specifically for the high priest on the Day of Atonement, emphasizing the need for holiness when approaching God. The tunic's simplicity contrasts with the usual ornate garments of the high priest, highlighting humility and the solemnity of the occasion. This attire can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His purity and righteousness, serves as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-15</a>).<p><b>with linen undergarments</b><br>The linen undergarments were worn to cover the priest's nakedness, ensuring modesty and respect in the presence of God. This requirement reflects the broader biblical theme of covering sin and shame, reminiscent of God providing garments for Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>). The use of linen, a material associated with purity, further underscores the need for holiness.<p><b>He must tie a linen sash around him</b><br>The linen sash was part of the priestly attire, used to secure the tunic and undergarments. It signifies readiness and service, as girding oneself was often associated with preparation for work or action (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-37</a>). The sash, like the other linen garments, symbolizes purity and dedication to God's service.<p><b>and put on the linen turban</b><br>The linen turban was worn on the head, signifying the priest's consecration and authority. It served as a reminder of the priest's role as an intermediary between God and the people. The turban's holiness is echoed in the inscription "Holy to the LORD" found on the high priest's regular headpiece (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), pointing to the need for a pure mind and heart in service to God.<p><b>These are holy garments</b><br>The designation of these garments as holy underscores their set-apart nature for divine service. Holiness in the Bible often involves separation from the common for a sacred purpose. The garments' holiness reflects the sanctity required of those who approach God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>and he must bathe himself with water before he wears them</b><br>The requirement for the high priest to bathe before donning the holy garments emphasizes the need for cleansing and purification before approaching God. This ritual washing symbolizes spiritual purification and is a precursor to the New Testament concept of baptism, which signifies the washing away of sin (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The act of washing also points to the ultimate cleansing provided by Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest at the time, who is given specific instructions for the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred place where the high priest performs rituals, including the Day of Atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>An annual event where the high priest enters the Holy of Holies to make atonement for the sins of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_garments.htm">Sacred Garments</a></b><br>Special linen clothing worn by the high priest, symbolizing purity and holiness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_cleansing.htm">Ritual Cleansing</a></b><br>The act of bathing before donning the sacred garments, signifying purification.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The sacred garments and ritual cleansing underscore the importance of approaching God with reverence and purity.

Of the white garments he possessed two sets, one of Egyptian linen, and the other of Indian and less costly linen. The community allowed the high priest thirty minae to purchase these garments, and he could add as much as he liked from his own money if he wished them to be more costly, provided the material was linen made of six double twisted threads and of flax. It was the more costly vestments of Egyptian linen which the high priest wore on this occasion. The latter he put on in the after part of the day when he entered the Holy of Holies to bring out the censer. These garments were the same as those of the ordinary priests, except the turban, which was a little taller.<p><span class= "bld">And he shall wash.</span>--He had to bathe his body every time when he changed his vestments.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - His special garments for the occasion are <span class="cmt_word">the holy linen coat</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">the linen breeches</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">a linen girdle</span>,... <span class="cmt_word">and the linen mitre.</span> In the original the definite article is not expressed. The reading should therefore be, <span class="accented">He shall put on a holy linen coat, and he shall have linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen mitre shall be attired.</span> The clothing was white from head to foot, differing therein from the dress of the ordinary priest, inasmuch as the sash or girdle of the latter was of variegated materials, and differing also in the shape of the mitre. The white clothing was not intended to symbolize humility and penitence, as some have thought, for white is not the colour in which penitents are naturally dressed. Rather it was symbolical of the purity and holiness which the ceremonies of the day symbolically affected, and which was specially needed to be exhibited in the person of the high priest. In the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel, the angel of God is clothed in <span class="accented">linen</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6, 7</a>). And the colour of the angelic raiment is described in the Gospels as <span class="accented">white:</span> "his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow" (<a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>); "they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment" (<a href="/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>); "two men stood by them in shining garments" (<a href="/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>); she "seeth two angels in white sitting" (<a href="/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>). So, too, the wife of the Lamb, in the Book of the Revelation, has it "granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints" (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). The white linen dress of the high priest, therefore (which must have given the appearance of the English surplice tied in at the waist), was intended to symbolize the purity and brightness which forms the characteristic of angels and saints, and, above all, of the King of saints. "The white material of the dress which Aaron wore when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of his nature, effected by himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by his own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12, 24</a>)" (Keil). The symbolism of the <span class="accented">holy garments</span> as indicating holiness and purity, is strengthened by the command that Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</span> The high priest's acts on this day, so far as they are recounted in this chapter, were the following. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He bathed. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He dressed himself in his white holy garments. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He offered or presented at the door of the tabernacle a bullock for a sin offering for himself and his house.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He is to wear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(yil&#183;b&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3847.htm">Strong's 3847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrap around, to put on a, garment, clothe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sacred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1436;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;&#7695;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6944.htm">Strong's 6944: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacred place, thing, sanctity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">linen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_906.htm">Strong's 906: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flaxen thread, yarn, a linen garment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tunic,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1465;&#1469;&#1504;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;ne&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3801.htm">Strong's 3801: </a> </span><span class="str2">A shirt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with linen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_906.htm">Strong's 906: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flaxen thread, yarn, a linen garment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">undergarments.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1499;&#1456;&#1504;&#1456;&#1505;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#7733;&#183;n&#601;&#183;s&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
