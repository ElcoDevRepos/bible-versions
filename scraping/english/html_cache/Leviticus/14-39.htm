In the context of Leviticus, the seventh day is part of a purification process, emphasizing the importance of thoroughness and divine timing in addressing impurity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's perfect timing and order.<p><b>the priest is to return and inspect the house.</b><br>The role of the priest in ancient Israel extended beyond spiritual duties to include health and community welfare. Priests acted as mediators between God and the people, and their involvement in inspecting houses for mildew underscores their role in maintaining holiness and purity within the community. This inspection process can be seen as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, inspecting and purifying His church (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>If the mildew has spread on the walls,</b><br>Mildew, or mold, in biblical times was considered a serious issue, not only for health reasons but also because it rendered a place ceremonially unclean. The spread of mildew symbolizes the pervasive nature of sin and impurity, which can corrupt and defile if not addressed. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where sin is often described as leaven that spreads (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>).

(See <a href="/leviticus/4-11.htm" title="And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,">Leviticus 4:11</a>.) It will be seen that out of the eight verbs used in <a href="/context/leviticus/14-40.htm" title="Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:">Leviticus 14:40-42</a> in connection with the removing of the affected stones and the constitution of new ones, the scraping, and the plaistering, six are in the plural: viz., they shall take, they shall cast (<a href="/leviticus/14-40.htm" title="Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:">Leviticus 14:40</a>); they shall pour out, they shall scrape off (<a href="/leviticus/14-41.htm" title="And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:">Leviticus 14:41</a>); they shall take, they shall put them (<a href="/leviticus/14-42.htm" title="And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.">Leviticus 14:42</a>); and two are in the singular: viz., he shall take other mortar, he shall plaister (<a href="/leviticus/14-42.htm" title="And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.">Leviticus 14:42</a>). From this the authorities during the second Temple concluded, and hence enacted, that if the affected stones are in a partition wall which divides two houses occupied by two different owners, both alike must take part in the first six acts, whilst the new mortaring and the plaistering must be done by the owner of the affected house alone. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7637.htm">Strong's 7637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventh (an ordinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3548.htm">Strong's 3548: </a> </span><span class="str2">Priest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is to return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and inspect [the house].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
