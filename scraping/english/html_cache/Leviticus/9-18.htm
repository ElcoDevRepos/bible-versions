It symbolized peace and fellowship between the offerer and God, often accompanied by a communal meal. The ox and the ram were significant animals in sacrificial rituals, representing strength and submission. The act of slaughtering these animals was a vivid reminder of the cost of reconciliation with God. This offering was distinct from sin and guilt offerings, focusing on thanksgiving and communion. The peace offering foreshadows the ultimate peace brought by Jesus Christ, who reconciled humanity to God through His sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>His sons brought him the blood,</b><br>The involvement of Aaron's sons in the sacrificial process highlights the priestly role of mediation between God and the people. Blood, representing life, was central to the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The priests' handling of the blood underscores the seriousness of their duties and the sanctity of the sacrificial rites. This act prefigures the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the High Priest who offers His own blood for the atonement of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>and he splattered it on all sides of the altar.</b><br>The splattering of blood on the altar was a ritual act signifying purification and consecration. The altar, as the focal point of sacrifice, needed to be sanctified to receive the offerings. This act ensured that the offering was acceptable to God. The comprehensive application of blood on all sides of the altar symbolizes the thoroughness of atonement and the encompassing nature of God's grace. This practice points to the comprehensive cleansing available through Christ's sacrifice, which purifies believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who performs the sacrificial rituals.
