In the context of <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, this is specifically related to the Day of Atonement, a solemn day of reflection and penitence. The requirement to humble oneself underscores the importance of recognizing one's sinfulness and need for atonement. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-5</a>, where fasting is linked to humility and repentance. The Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, is a critical observance in the Jewish calendar, emphasizing reconciliation with God and community.<p><b>he must be cut off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" signifies a severe consequence, often interpreted as excommunication or even death. This phrase highlights the seriousness of failing to observe the Day of Atonement. In the ancient Israelite community, communal identity and covenant relationship with God were paramount. To be cut off meant losing one's place within the covenant community, which was both a spiritual and social penalty. This concept is seen in other parts of the Torah, such as <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>, where failure to adhere to God's commands results in being cut off. Theologically, this foreshadows the ultimate separation from God due to unrepentant sin, a theme further developed in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings of Jesus about the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the Levitical laws, including the Day of Atonement, which is the context of this verse.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A sacred day of fasting, repentance, and atonement for the sins of the people, central to the context of this verse.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The place where the high priest would perform the atonement rituals, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for making atonement for the people, entering the Holy of Holies on their behalf.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_humility.htm">The Importance of Humility</a></b><br>Humility is not just an outward act but an inward posture of the heart.

No priest, elder, or ordinary citizen could claim exemption. In <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>, &#8220;God does not show favoritism&#8221;, and <a href="/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a> echoes that &#8220;in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him&#8221;. The universal scope reminds us that sin and pride touch all hearts; therefore every person must heed the instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>does not humble himself</b><p>Humbling (often expressed in Israel by fasting and confession) was at the heart of the Day of Atonement. <a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>,31 twice commands Israel to &#8220;afflict yourselves&#8221;, underscoring inward repentance, not mere ritual. <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a> contrasts false fasting with true humility that bows &#8220;one&#8217;s head like a reed&#8221;. <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> urges, &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you&#8221;. The warning in our verse means spiritual pride cancels the benefits of atonement; refusal to bow becomes rebellion.<p>&#8226; Humility = acknowledging God&#8217;s holiness and our need of mercy.<p>&#8226; Pride = rejecting God&#8217;s assessment of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on this day</b><p>&#8220;This day&#8221; refers to the annual Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) on the tenth day of the seventh month (<a href="/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>). Once each year the high priest entered the Most Holy Place with blood for the nation&#8217;s sins (<a href="/leviticus/16-34.htm">Leviticus 16:34</a>). <a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a> points out that only on that single day did the high priest go behind the veil, prefiguring Christ&#8217;s once&#8208;for&#8208;all sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>). Because atonement was time-specific, neglecting the appointed moment meant missing the covering of sin God provided.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must be cut off</b><p>The phrase signals divine judgment, not mere social shunning. In <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> anyone uncircumcised &#8220;shall be cut off from his people&#8221;; in <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a> refusal to purge leaven has the same penalty. <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30&#8211;31</a> clarifies that deliberate sin brings being &#8220;cut off&#8221; because the offender &#8220;has despised the word of the LORD&#8221;. Cutting off could involve premature death (as with Korah in <a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>) or expulsion; either way, God Himself enforces it.<p>&#8226; Refusal to humble = treating the atonement lightly.<p>&#8226; Cutting off = God removes covenant benefits, protection, and fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from his people</b><p>The covenant community is meant to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). An unrepentant heart infects the camp, so removal guards purity. <a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a> warns of God setting His face &#8220;against that man and cutting him off from the midst of My people&#8221;. In the New Testament, the same principle applies when Paul directs the church at Corinth to &#8220;remove the wicked man from among yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>). Separation serves both discipline and the call back to repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/23-29.htm">Leviticus 23:29</a> teaches that every person in God&#8217;s covenant must humble himself on the Day of Atonement; failure to do so invites God&#8217;s decisive judgment, resulting in removal from the blessings and fellowship of His people. The verse highlights the seriousness of sin, the necessity of heartfelt repentance, and the holiness God demands of His covenant community&#8212;truths still fulfilled and magnified in Christ, our once-for-all atonement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) F<span class= "bld">or whatsoever soul . . . he shall be cut off from among his people.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">For whatsoever soul </span>. . . <span class= "ital">that shall be cut off from his people. </span>(See Note on <a href="/leviticus/19-8.htm" title="Therefore every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 19:8</a>.)
