The context emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's instructions regarding worship and the priesthood. The distinction between holy and common is foundational in Levitical law, underscoring the separation between what is consecrated to God and what is ordinary. This principle is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God calls His people to be set apart (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The concept of holiness is central to understanding God's nature and His expectations for His people. In the New Testament, believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>), reflecting this ongoing theme of separation and dedication to God.<p><b>between the clean and the unclean</b><br>The distinction between clean and unclean is a recurring theme in Leviticus, particularly in chapters 11-15, which detail dietary laws, purification rituals, and guidelines for dealing with various forms of impurity. These laws served to teach Israel about purity and the need for holiness in every aspect of life. The clean/unclean distinction also had practical implications for health and community living. In a broader theological sense, these laws pointed to the need for spiritual purity and foreshadowed the ultimate cleansing from sin through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills and transcends these laws, declaring all foods clean (<a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a>) and offering purification through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>). The call to discern between clean and unclean remains relevant as a metaphor for moral and spiritual discernment in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Thus, for instance, the rules as to which places and days and sundry portions of the offerings were holy or common, or as to holy fire and common fire, which Nadab and Abihu violated; or about ceremonially clean and unclean men, women, animals, and utensils.

Nadab and Abihu, on the contrary, had not distinguished between the sacred and profane fire, or between God's commands and their own unregulated impulses. If they had partaken too freely of the wine provided for the drink offerings, their sin would be similar to that of the Corinthians in their abuse of the Lord's Supper. As to the use of wine by the minister of God under the New Testament, see <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>.
