The command reflects the broader biblical principle of maintaining purity and holiness in personal conduct. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, approaching someone often implied initiating a relationship or interaction, particularly of a sexual nature. This phrase underscores the importance of respecting boundaries and the sanctity of personal space.<p><b>to have sexual relations with her</b><br>The prohibition against sexual relations during a woman's menstrual period is rooted in the concept of ritual purity. In the ancient Israelite context, sexual relations were not merely a private matter but had communal and spiritual implications. This command emphasizes the sacredness of sexual relations, which are to be conducted within the boundaries set by God. The act of sexual relations is seen as a covenantal act, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>during her menstrual period.</b><br>Menstruation was considered a time of ritual impurity in ancient Israel, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>. This period was marked by a temporary state of uncleanness, which required specific purification rituals. The command not to engage in sexual relations during this time is linked to the broader theme of holiness and separation from impurity. This law also served to protect women during a vulnerable time and ensured that the community remained ritually clean. The concept of purity is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live holy lives, set apart for God (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including those in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where they were to live according to God's laws and be set apart from the surrounding nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_code.htm">Holiness Code</a></b><br>A section of Leviticus (chapters 17-26) that includes laws about moral and ceremonial purity, emphasizing the holiness of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The command in <a href="/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a> is part of a broader call to holiness.

This phrase identifies the specific act forbidden in this moment, guarding the marriage bed from misuse (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The prohibition is moral, not misogynistic;
