In the context of <a href="/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>, God is instructing the Israelites on the observance of the Day of Atonement, a day of complete rest and fasting. The use of the word "destroy" indicates a severe consequence for disobedience, reflecting the holiness and justice of God. This echoes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience brings judgment. The concept of being "cut off" from the people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, signifying both physical and spiritual separation from the community of God's chosen people.<p><b>anyone who does any work</b><br>The prohibition against work on the Day of Atonement underscores the importance of rest and reflection on this sacred day. This command is part of a broader biblical principle of Sabbath rest, which is rooted in the creation narrative where God rested on the seventh day. The Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, is a day set apart for repentance and reconciliation with God, and work would distract from the solemnity and purpose of the day. This commandment highlights the need for complete devotion to God, setting aside daily activities to focus on spiritual renewal.<p><b>on this day</b><br>The specific reference to "this day" points to the Day of Atonement, one of the most significant holy days in the Jewish calendar. It is a day dedicated to atonement and repentance, where the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for the sins of the people. This day foreshadows the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who, as the Great High Priest, offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sin. The emphasis on "this day" also serves to remind the Israelites of the unique and sacred nature of the appointed times set by God, which are to be observed with reverence and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of the book of Leviticus, the Israelites were God's chosen people, receiving His laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A significant holy day in the Jewish calendar, a day of rest, fasting, and repentance, during which the Israelites were commanded to abstain from work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, where the Day of Atonement rituals were performed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting for the giving of the Law, where the Israelites wandered for 40 years after their exodus from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s command to abstain from work on the Day of Atonement underscores the importance of obedience to His laws.

This stronger term may be owing to the fact that the day of Atonement is the most solemn day in the whole year, and that violating its sanctity will be visited more severely. Hence the severer expression used on this occasion. It is, however, to be remarked that whilst working on the sabbath was punished with death by stoning, he who transgressed the law of labour on the day of Atonement was punished with excision.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/23-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will destroy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
