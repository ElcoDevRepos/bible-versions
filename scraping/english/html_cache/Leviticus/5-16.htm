In the context of ancient Israel, these holy things were set apart for worship and service to God, and any misuse or desecration was considered a serious offense. The holiness of these items underscores the importance of maintaining purity and reverence in worship practices, as seen in other passages like <a href="/exodus/30-37.htm">Exodus 30:37-38</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-32.htm">Numbers 18:32</a>.<p><b>he must make restitution</b><br>Restitution involves compensating for the loss or damage caused. This principle is rooted in the broader biblical theme of justice and restoration, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-14</a>. It reflects God's desire for His people to live in harmony and fairness, ensuring that wrongs are righted and relationships are restored.<p><b>by adding a fifth of its value to it</b><br>The addition of a fifth (20%) to the restitution amount emphasizes the seriousness of the offense and the need for genuine repentance. This extra payment serves as a deterrent against future transgressions and highlights the cost of sin. The concept of adding a fifth is also found in <a href="/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13, 15, 19, 27, 31</a>, indicating a consistent approach to restitution in the Mosaic Law.<p><b>and giving it to the priest</b><br>The priest acts as an intermediary between the offender and God, a role that foreshadows the mediatory work of Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The involvement of the priest ensures that the restitution is properly handled and that the offender is reconciled with God and the community.<p><b>who will make atonement on his behalf</b><br>Atonement involves covering or removing sin, allowing the individual to be reconciled with God. This process is central to the sacrificial system and points to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ on the cross (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>). The priest's role in making atonement underscores the need for a mediator in the process of forgiveness and reconciliation.<p><b>with the ram as a guilt offering</b><br>The guilt offering, or trespass offering, is specifically for unintentional sins or sins requiring restitution. The use of a ram signifies the seriousness of the offense and the need for a valuable sacrifice. This offering prefigures Christ's sacrifice, as He is described as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>and he will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness is the ultimate goal of the atonement process, restoring the sinner to a right relationship with God. This assurance of forgiveness reflects God's mercy and grace, themes that are prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, <a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>).

Yet in His grace, the same God provided a path to full forgiveness through the priestly atonement&#8212;pointing ahead to the ultimate restitution and sacrifice accomplished by Christ on the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And he shall make amends.</span>--As the sacrifice was simply to atone for the transgression, the offender was in the first place to make restitution of the full value of the principal which he had inadvertently appropriated.<p><span class= "bld">And shall add the fifth part thereto.</span>--Besides paying the principal, the fifth part of the value of the holy property thus restored is to be added to the original amount. According to the rules which obtained in the time of Christ, the principal was estimated as four-fifths of the whole, and the lacking one-fifth was added. Thus, for instance, if the offender had consumed holy things to the value of four shekels, he had to pay five shekels, the fifth being added to the four. This, according to our mode of reckoning, is one-fourth. No distinction is here made whether the offender be the high priest, a prince, or a private individual.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Regarding any holy thing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1465;&#1436;&#1491;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(haq&#183;q&#333;&#183;&#7695;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
