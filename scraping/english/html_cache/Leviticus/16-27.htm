The bull and the goat represent the sin offerings for the high priest and the people, respectively. This ritual underscores the gravity of sin and the necessity of a sacrificial system to maintain a relationship with God. The use of animals for sin offerings is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing the need for a substitute to bear the consequences of sin.<p><b>Whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement</b><br>The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost part of the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt. Only the high priest could enter this sacred space, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement. The blood of the bull and goat was sprinkled on the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the priest and the people. This act prefigures the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins, as referenced in <a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>.<p><b>Must be taken outside the camp</b><br>Taking the remains of the sin offerings outside the camp signifies the removal of sin and impurity from the community. This practice highlights the separation between the holy and the profane, a recurring theme in Leviticus. It also foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus, who suffered outside the city gates, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>, symbolizing the bearing of sin and shame on behalf of humanity.<p><b>And their hides, flesh, and dung must be burned up</b><br>The complete burning of the remains signifies the total destruction of sin and its consequences. This act of burning outside the camp ensures that no impurity remains within the community, maintaining the holiness required by God. The burning of the sin offering's remains is a vivid illustration of the seriousness with which God views sin and the thoroughness required in its removal. This complete consumption by fire can be seen as a type of the final judgment, where sin is utterly destroyed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

The ritual highlights the seriousness of sin, the necessity of a substitutionary death, the removal of guilt from God&#8217;s people, and the complete judgment that sin warrants. Ultimately, the verse anticipates Christ, whose blood truly cleanses, whose body was taken outside the city, and whose sacrifice forever puts away sin for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">And the bullock.</span>--That is, the bodies of the sin offerings for the priests and the people (see <a href="/context/leviticus/16-5.htm" title="And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:5-6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-9.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.">Leviticus 16:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-11.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:">Leviticus 16:11</a>), whose blood the high priest carried into the Holy of Holies.

Hence the ancient Palestinian Targum translates it, "they shall be carried out on poles by the hands of the younger priests." As has already been remarked, the priest performed this part of the service immediately after the goat was dispatched by the messenger to the wilderness. Whilst the victims were being burned outside the camp the high priest read in the women's court the appointed lessons for the Day of Atonement (viz., <a href="/leviticus/23-26.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:26</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/29-7.htm" title="And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls: you shall not do any work therein:">Numbers 29:7-11</a>) in the presence of the congregation, who were all standing, and at the conclusion of the reading pronounced the eight benedictions (1) on the Divine Law, (2) on the public service, (3) on confession, (4) forgiveness of sins, (5) on Jerusalem, (6) on the Temple, (7) on Israel, and (8) on the priesthood. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - As the blood of the bullock and the goat which had been offered in the special expiatory sacrifices of the day had been carried within the sanctuary (verses 14, 15), their bodies had to be burnt without the camp (<a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12</a>). Our Lord being the antitype, not only of Aaron as the Great High Priest, but also of the expiatory sacrifices as the Great Sin Offering, the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that the fact of Christ's having "suffered without the camp" serves as an indication that his blood had in its atoning effects been carried by him into heaven, the antitype of the holy of holies (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). The flesh of the other goat, offered as a sin offering, would have been eaten by the priests in the evening, at a sacrificial meal (<a href="/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17, 18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The bull</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(par)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6499.htm">Strong's 6499: </a> </span><span class="str2">Young bull, steer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the sin offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
