Anointing was a significant ritual in ancient Israel, symbolizing the setting apart of individuals for sacred duties. The anointing oil, a blend of olive oil and spices, was used to consecrate priests, kings, and prophets, signifying the Holy Spirit's empowerment. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>).<p><b>the LORD commanded</b><br>The authority of the command comes directly from Yahweh, emphasizing the divine origin of the priestly duties and provisions. This underscores the theocratic nature of Israel, where God Himself established laws and ordinances. The command reflects God's provision and care for those serving in His sanctuary, ensuring they are supported by the community they serve.<p><b>that this be given them by the sons of Israel</b><br>The "this" refers to the portions of the sacrifices allocated to the priests, as detailed in <a href="/leviticus/7.htm">Leviticus 7</a>. The sons of Israel, representing the entire community, were responsible for providing these portions. This system highlights the communal aspect of worship and the mutual dependence between the priests and the people. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of supporting those who minister in spiritual matters (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>It is a permanent portion</b><br>The term "permanent" indicates the enduring nature of this provision, meant to last throughout the generations. This reflects the unchanging nature of God's covenant with Israel and His ongoing provision for those who serve Him. The concept of a "portion" also points to the idea of inheritance, which in the New Testament is fulfilled in the spiritual inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's commandments and the lasting nature of His provisions. It ensures that future generations of priests would also be cared for, maintaining the stability and function of the priestly service. This continuity is mirrored in the New Covenant, where the priesthood of all believers is established, and the eternal priesthood of Christ is affirmed (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands and establishes the laws and statutes for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are given specific instructions on how to live and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests (Aaron and his sons)</a></b><br>The anointed servants of God, set apart to perform the duties of the tabernacle and later the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/anointing.htm">Anointing</a></b><br>A ceremonial act signifying the consecration and setting apart of the priests for their sacred duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/perpetual_portion.htm">Perpetual Portion</a></b><br>A designated share of offerings given to the priests as a lasting ordinance, ensuring their sustenance and support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_his_servants.htm">God's Provision for His Servants</a></b><br>God ensures that those who serve Him are provided for, demonstrating His care and provision for those dedicated to His work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_anointing.htm">The Importance of Anointing</a></b><br>Anointing signifies being set apart for God's purposes.
