In the context of the Israelites, a "permanent statute" signifies a divine ordinance that transcends generations, reflecting God's unchanging nature. This commandment is part of the Mosaic Law, which was given to guide the Israelites in their covenant relationship with God. The concept of a permanent statute underscores the seriousness of the Day of Atonement and its role in maintaining the holiness of the community.<p><b>to make atonement once a year</b><br>The Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, is the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar, dedicated to repentance and reconciliation with God. The annual observance highlights the necessity of regular purification and the acknowledgment of sin. The ritual involved the high priest entering the Holy of Holies to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people, symbolizing the need for mediation between God and humanity. This annual atonement prefigures the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who, according to the New Testament, offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>).<p><b>for the Israelites because of all their sins.</b><br>The focus on "all their sins" indicates the comprehensive nature of the atonement, covering both known and unknown transgressions. This reflects the understanding that sin affects the entire community and requires collective repentance. The Israelites' need for atonement underscores the holiness of God and the separation caused by sin. In a broader biblical context, this points to the universal need for redemption, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through the sacrifice of Christ, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>And all this was done as the LORD had commanded Moses.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to divine instruction, highlighting Moses' role as a faithful servant and mediator of God's law. The adherence to God's commands is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, illustrating the importance of following divine guidance for the well-being of the community. The meticulous observance of the Day of Atonement rituals as commanded by God underscores the seriousness with which the Israelites were to approach their relationship with Him. This obedience is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law and the prophets, acting in complete accordance with the Father's will (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments, including the instructions for the Day of Atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, for whom the Day of Atonement was instituted to cleanse them from their sins annually.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who established the Day of Atonement as a means for His people to be reconciled to Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_atonement.htm">Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>A sacred and solemn day in the Jewish calendar, designated for the atonement of the sins of the Israelites through specific rituals and sacrifices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the high priest would perform the atonement rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_permanence_of_god's_statutes.htm">The Permanence of God's Statutes</a></b><br>God's commandments, such as the Day of Atonement, were established as permanent statutes, reflecting His unchanging nature and the ongoing need for atonement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The annual atonement ritual underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of reconciliation with God, pointing to the ultimate atonement through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' adherence to God's instructions through Moses serves as a model for our obedience to God's Word today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_high_priest.htm">The Role of the High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest's role in making atonement foreshadows Christ's role as our High Priest, who intercedes on our behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_individual_responsibility.htm">Community and Individual Responsibility</a></b><br>While the Day of Atonement was a communal event, it also called for individual reflection and repentance, reminding us of our personal responsibility in our relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_16_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 16:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_16_34_s_annual_atonement.htm">How does Leviticus 16:34 emphasize the importance of annual atonement for Israel's sins?

Here, again, we have an instance of how the same phrase which occurs three times within four verses (see <a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm" title="And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojournes among you:">Leviticus 16:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-31.htm" title="It shall be a sabbath of rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.">Leviticus 16:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-34.htm" title="And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.

The thrice-repeated phrase emphasises the abiding nature of this law, and indicates the solemnity of the day.<span class= "bld"><p>And he did as the Lord commanded Moses</span>--That is, Aaron performed the service for the first time, according to the ordinances which the Lord communicated to Moses. A similar remark occurs at the first observance of the Passover. (See <a href="/exodus/12-50.htm" title="Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.">Exodus 12:50</a>.) The solemn admonition, therefore, addressed to the priesthood at the beginning of this chapter (see <a href="/context/leviticus/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;">Leviticus 16:1-2</a>), not to presume on their office, but to submit to the Divine regulations, was duly observed by the first high priest. It may, however, also be designed to indicate that Aaron did not assume the dignity of the pontificate to exalt himself, but in obedience to the command God gave to Moses. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This shall be an everlasting statute unto you</span>.

It is a providential dispensation of God that the city and temple of Jerusalem have been destroyed; for if they were still standing, some who are weak in faith might be dazzled by the outward splendor of the literal types, and not drawn by faith to the spiritual antitypes. If there are any, therefore, who, in considering the Levitical ritual of the great Day of Atonement, and in looking at the two he-goats - the one sacrificed, the other let go, charged with <span class="accented">sins</span>, into the wilderness - do not recognize the one Christ who died for our <span class="accented">sins</span> and took away our <span class="accented">sins</span>, and do not see there the 'everlasting statute' of which God here speaks by Moses, let him go up thrice a year to Jerusalem, and there search for the altar which has crumbled in the dust, and offer up his victims there without a priest. But no; thanks be to God, the earthly priesthood and temple are abolished, that we may raise our heart to the heavenly, and look up with faith and love and joy to him who offered himself once for all, and who ever liveth to make intercession for us" (Origen, 'Hom.' 10, as quoted by Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And he did as the Lord commanded Moses</span>; that is.
