Bread, a staple in ancient Israel, symbolizes basic provision and life. The cutting off of bread supply reflects a covenant curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>) and serves as a reminder of Israel's dependence on God for their daily needs, echoing the Lord's Prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, "Give us this day our daily bread."<p><b>ten women will bake your bread in a single oven</b><br>This imagery suggests scarcity and rationing. In ancient times, bread was typically baked in communal ovens, but the mention of ten women using a single oven highlights extreme shortage. It reflects a situation where resources are so limited that many must share what little is available. This scarcity is a direct result of the people's failure to uphold the covenant, as seen in the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and dole out your bread by weight</b><br>Bread being measured by weight indicates severe rationing, a sign of famine and distress. This practice contrasts with times of abundance when bread would be freely available. The careful measurement underscores the dire circumstances and the people's need to rely on God's provision. This rationing is reminiscent of the famine in Egypt during Joseph's time (<a href="/genesis/41-54.htm">Genesis 41:54-57</a>), where food was distributed carefully to ensure survival.<p><b>so that you will eat but not be satisfied</b><br>This phrase conveys the futility and dissatisfaction that comes from disobedience to God. Despite eating, the people will not find fulfillment or nourishment, symbolizing spiritual emptiness and the consequences of turning away from God. This lack of satisfaction is echoed in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>, where the people sow much but harvest little, eat but never have enough, drink but never have their fill, wear clothes but are not warm, and earn wages only to put them in a purse with holes. It points to the deeper spiritual truth that true satisfaction comes only from a right relationship with God, as Jesus declares in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, "I am the bread of life.

God Himself is the One who withholds daily provision, underlining that blessings and necessities ultimately come from Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>). The withholding of bread was specifically promised as a covenant consequence if Israel rejected God&#8217;s statutes (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-20</a>). Similar warnings appear in <a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a> where &#8220;the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to take from Jerusalem&#8230; the whole supply of bread,&#8221; showing that national sin brings tangible, measurable loss.<p>&#8226; Bread represents basic life and security; losing it points to life unraveling at its most fundamental level.<p>&#8226; The action is purposeful, not accidental&#8212;He &#8220;cuts off,&#8221; emphasizing God&#8217;s active role in discipline.<p>&#8226; The verse highlights that physical scarcity is meant to turn hearts back to the Provider (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ten women will bake your bread in a single oven</b><p>Having &#8220;ten women&#8221; use one oven pictures widespread scarcity.
