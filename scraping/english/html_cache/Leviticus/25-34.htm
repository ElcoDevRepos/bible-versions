These lands were essential for the sustenance of the Levites, who did not receive a tribal inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. The Levites were set apart for religious duties, and their sustenance was provided through these lands and the tithes of the people. The cities mentioned are those allocated to the Levites, as described in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where God commands the Israelites to give cities and surrounding pasturelands to the Levites.<p><b>may not be sold</b><br>This prohibition against selling the pastureland underscores the importance of maintaining the Levitical cities' integrity and function. The Levites' role as spiritual leaders and mediators required stability and continuity, which could be compromised if their lands were sold. This command reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and the idea that the land ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). It also highlights the importance of preserving the resources necessary for the Levites to fulfill their duties.<p><b>for this is their permanent possession</b><br>The phrase "permanent possession" indicates the enduring nature of the Levites' claim to these lands. Unlike other Israelites, who could sell and redeem their property, the Levites' lands were to remain with them perpetually. This provision ensured that the Levites could continue their service to God and the community without the distraction or instability that might come from losing their land. This concept of a permanent possession can be seen as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, which speaks of an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the book of Leviticus, the Israelites were God's chosen people, set apart to live according to His laws and commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The land given to the Israelites by God, which they were to steward according to His laws, including the laws of the Sabbath and Jubilee.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties, including the care of the tabernacle and later the temple.
