Aaron, as the high priest, and his sons, who serve as priests, are central figures in the religious life of Israel. The inclusion of "all the Israelites" indicates that the message is not just for the priestly class but for the entire nation. This reflects the communal nature of the covenant relationship with God, where both leaders and laypeople are accountable. The role of Aaron and his sons is crucial, as they are mediators between God and the people, a role that foreshadows the mediating work of Jesus Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and tell them this is what the LORD has commanded:</b><br>The phrase underscores the divine authority behind the instructions. The LORD's commands are not mere suggestions but are binding and authoritative. This reflects the covenantal relationship where God, as the sovereign, sets the terms. The use of "commanded" highlights the seriousness and non-negotiable nature of the instructions. This is consistent with the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to diligently follow God's commands. The emphasis on divine command also points to the prophetic tradition, where prophets often begin their messages with "Thus says the LORD," indicating that they speak with God's authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

By addressing Aaron, God reinforces the priest&#8217;s responsibility to model obedience. Moses had previously been told, &#8220;Bring near to you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>), showing the central role Aaron would play. Later Scripture underscores the weight of that calling; <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> reminds us that &#8220;no one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.&#8221; When God speaks directly to Aaron through Moses, it is a clear affirmation that leadership must be anchored in God&#8217;s revealed word, not personal opinion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his sons</b><p>God&#8217;s word immediately widens to &#8220;his sons,&#8221; the entire priestly line. The sons are warned by their father&#8217;s failures (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) that priestly privilege does not shield anyone from holy accountability. <a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a> echoes this when the Lord tells Aaron, &#8220;You and your sons and your father&#8217;s household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary.&#8221; In other words, obedience is a family mandate, passing from generation to generation. First Peter 2:9 later applies priestly language to all believers, signaling that every follower of Christ now shares a similar calling to handle God&#8217;s truth with reverence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the Israelites</b><p>The circle expands beyond clergy to the entire covenant community. Holiness is never limited to a religious elite; God&#8217;s people as a whole are addressed. <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a> had already declared, &#8220;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&#8221; Moses&#8217; inclusion of &#8220;all the Israelites&#8221; reinforces that every household matters in maintaining covenant fidelity (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>). Even the New Testament reaffirms this equality of accountability: &#8220;There is no distinction, for all have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22-23</a>). God&#8217;s standards unite the community under one rule&#8212;His revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell them</b><p>The phrase places Moses in the role of faithful messenger. He is to convey, not edit, the divine word. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> warns, &#8220;You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take away from it.&#8221; Jeremiah heard something similar: &#8220;You shall speak all that I command you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>). In the Great Commission, Jesus continues the pattern, instructing His disciples to be teaching others &#8220;to observe all that I have commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). At every stage of redemption history, God entrusts His word to human voices so it can reach human hearts unchanged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this is what the LORD has commanded</b><p>The phrase settles all debate: the command originates with Yahweh. Authority rests not in Moses&#8217; leadership ability or Israel&#8217;s communal consensus but in the very character of God. <a href="/psalms/119-4.htm">Psalm 119:4</a> states, &#8220;You have ordained Your precepts, that we should keep them diligently,&#8221; and Jesus later affirms, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Obedience is expected because the Commander is the covenant-keeping God whose words are life (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46-47</a>). To accept or reject the instruction is, therefore, to accept or reject the Lord Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/17-2.htm">Leviticus 17:2</a> highlights God&#8217;s orderly chain of communication&#8212;leader to priesthood to people&#8212;while underscoring that all alike live under divine command. Aaron&#8217;s high calling, his sons&#8217; shared responsibility, the nation&#8217;s collective accountability, Moses&#8217; duty to speak plainly, and the Lord&#8217;s absolute authority together teach that every believer today is invited into obedient fellowship with a holy God whose word remains eternally binding.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And unto all the children of Israel.</span>--To understand the import of this phrase, and its bearing upon the injunction in question, it is necessary to notice that the words "and unto all the children of Israel" are here used for the first time. Hitherto the Divine communications were made to (1) Moses alone, without his being ordered to speak to any one else (<a href="/leviticus/5-14.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 5:14</a>, <a href="/leviticus/6-12.htm" title="And the fire on the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order on it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.">Leviticus 6:12</a>, <a href="/leviticus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 8:1</a>, (<a href="/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 14:1</a>); (2) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron (<a href="/leviticus/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;">Leviticus 16:1</a>); (3) to Moses, with the command to speak to Aaron and his sons (<a href="/leviticus/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 6:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm" title="It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.">Leviticus 6:17</a>); (4) to Moses, with a command to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,">Leviticus 1:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 4:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-28.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 7:28</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 12:1</a>); (5) to Moses and Aaron conjointly, without being ordered to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 13:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 14:33</a>); (6) to Moses and Aaron conjointly, who <span class= "bld">are </span>ordered to speak to the children of Israel (<a href="/leviticus/11-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,">Leviticus 11:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 15:1</a>); and (7) Aaron alone is addressed (<a href="/leviticus/10-8.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,">Leviticus 10:8</a>). In the chapter before us, however, the communication is made to Moses alone, and he is commanded not only to impart its contents to Aaron and his sons--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the priesthood--but "unto all the children of Israel," or their representatives, at the same time. The pontiff and the priests are thus put on a level with the ordinary Israelite or the laity, as far as this regulation is concerned. There are only two other occasions on which this phrase is used again, viz., <a href="/leviticus/21-24.htm" title="And Moses told it to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.">Leviticus 21:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-18.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;">Leviticus 22:18</a>. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1436;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his sons,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
