This type of offering is distinct from sin or guilt offerings, which were mandatory. Thanksgiving offerings were a way for the Israelites to acknowledge God's provision and blessings. The concept of thanksgiving is deeply rooted in the Hebrew tradition, as seen in Psalms and other scriptures, where gratitude is a central theme. This offering prefigures the New Testament call to give thanks in all circumstances (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p><b>then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving</b><br>The sacrifice of thanksgiving was part of the peace offerings, which were shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer. This communal aspect highlights the fellowship between God and His people. The peace offering symbolizes reconciliation and communion, pointing forward to the ultimate reconciliation through Christ, who is our peace (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil</b><br>Unleavened cakes signify purity and the absence of sin, as leaven often represents sin in the Bible (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). Olive oil, a staple in ancient Israel, symbolizes the Holy Spirit and anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The mixing of oil with the cakes indicates the presence and work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer, foreshadowing the anointing of Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit in the New Covenant.<p><b>unleavened wafers coated with oil</b><br>The unleavened wafers, like the cakes, emphasize purity and holiness. Coating them with oil further signifies consecration and the work of the Holy Spirit. This imagery is consistent with the anointing of priests and kings in the Old Testament, pointing to Jesus as the Anointed One, the Messiah (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil</b><br>Fine flour represents the best of what one can offer, indicating the quality and sincerity of the worshiper's gift. The well-kneaded nature of the cakes suggests thorough preparation and dedication. Mixing with oil again highlights the role of the Holy Spirit. This offering reflects the believer's call to present themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), and points to Christ, the Bread of Life, who was without sin and fully consecrated to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the thank offering, representing the Israelites who were commanded to bring offerings to God as expressions of gratitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who performs the sacrificial rituals, ensuring that the offerings are made according to God's instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/thank_offering.htm">Thank Offering</a></b><br>A type of peace offering given to express gratitude to God, often in response to His blessings or deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unleavened_cakes_and_wafers.htm">Unleavened Cakes and Wafers</a></b><br>Specific types of bread used in the thank offering, symbolizing purity and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_as_worship.htm">Gratitude as Worship</a></b><br>The thank offering teaches us that gratitude is a vital part of worship.

The rule which obtained during the second Temple with regard to this offering was as follows :--The offerer brought twenty tenths or pottles of fine flour; ten of them he made leavened and ten he left unleavened. He made the leavened into ten cakes, and of the ten that were unleavened he made thirty cakes. These thirty unleavened cakes, which were made with half a log of oil, were divided into three tens, and each ten was prepared in a different manner; that is, ten with an eighth of the oil were baked in the oven, ten with another eighth of the oil were made into wafers, and ten with a fourth of the oil were hastily fried.
