The chapter details blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The "things" mentioned include various forms of discipline intended to bring the Israelites back to faithfulness. This reflects the biblical principle that God uses circumstances to guide and correct His people, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>, which speaks of the Lord disciplining those He loves.<p><b>you do not accept My discipline</b><br>Discipline here is understood as corrective measures taken by God to bring His people back to righteousness. The Hebrew word for discipline can also mean instruction or correction, indicating a purpose beyond mere punishment. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, where the wise are encouraged not to despise the Lord's discipline. The refusal to accept discipline is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting the stubbornness of the human heart and the need for repentance.<p><b>but continue to walk in hostility toward Me</b><br>Walking in hostility implies a deliberate and ongoing rebellion against God. This phrase suggests a conscious choice to oppose God's will, reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated disobedience throughout their history. The imagery of "walking" is often used in Scripture to describe one's way of life or conduct, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. Hostility toward God is not just passive indifference but active resistance, which ultimately leads to separation from Him. This rebellion is contrasted with the call to walk in the Spirit, as described in <a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>, which leads to life and peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, the Israelites were God's chosen people, whom He delivered from Egypt and to whom He gave the Law through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, Moses was the mediator of God's covenant and the one through whom God communicated His laws and commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

The phrase points back to those real, literal consequences&#8212;crop failures, wild beasts, and enemy domination&#8212;that God had already described.<p>&#8226; Even severe hardships are purposeful, designed to turn hearts back to the Lord (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet history shows that people often harden themselves further (<a href="/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>).<p>The Lord&#8217;s patience is remarkable, but it is not limitless. He gives time and evidence so that repentance is possible, then holds people accountable for how they respond.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you do not accept My discipline</b><p>Discipline here is God&#8217;s corrective training, not random punishment. He desires restoration, not destruction.<p>&#8226; &#8220;For whom the LORD loves He disciplines&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusing discipline is to despise wisdom and life itself (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; 15:32).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this heart when He says, &#8220;Those I love, I rebuke and discipline&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p>God&#8217;s chastening is proof of His covenant love. Accepting it means humbling ourselves, confessing sin, and aligning with His ways. To reject it is to reject the very remedy He offers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but continue to walk in hostility toward Me</b><p>Hostility is not passive neglect; it is active resistance.
