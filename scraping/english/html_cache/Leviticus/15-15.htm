The role of the priest was crucial in maintaining the holiness required by the Law. Sacrifices were central to this process, symbolizing the removal of sin and impurity. The priest's involvement underscores the necessity of an intermediary, foreshadowing the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who would offer Himself as the perfect sacrifice.<p><b>one as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was designed to atone for unintentional sins and cleanse the individual from impurity. It highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for purification. This offering points to the sacrificial work of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity, providing a way for believers to be cleansed and reconciled to God.<p><b>and the other as a burnt offering</b><br>The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, symbolizing total dedication and surrender to God. It was completely consumed by fire, representing the offerer's complete devotion. This offering prefigures Christ's total obedience and submission to the Father's will, culminating in His sacrificial death on the cross.<p><b>In this way the priest will make atonement for the man</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the shedding of blood. The priest's actions here are a temporary measure, pointing to the ultimate atonement made by Christ. His sacrifice on the cross provides permanent reconciliation for those who believe, fulfilling the requirements of the Law once and for all.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The phrase "before the LORD" emphasizes the presence and holiness of God. All sacrificial acts were performed with an awareness of God's holiness and the need for purity. This setting underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of approaching God with reverence and obedience, a theme echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>because of his discharge</b><br>The discharge mentioned refers to a physical impurity that rendered a person ceremonially unclean. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin as a defiling force that separates humanity from God. The need for cleansing from such impurities points to the deeper spiritual cleansing provided by Christ, who heals and restores those who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrifices and rituals as prescribed by the Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_a_discharge.htm">The Man with a Discharge</a></b><br>Represents individuals who are ceremonially unclean due to bodily discharges, requiring purification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides the means for atonement and purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sin_offering.htm">Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice made to atone for sin and cleanse impurity, symbolizing the need for forgiveness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrifice of dedication and worship, symbolizing complete surrender to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of ritual purity in the Old Testament as a means of maintaining a relationship with a holy God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>Appreciate the priest's role as a mediator, pointing to Jesus Christ as our ultimate High Priest who intercedes for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_sacrifices.htm">Significance of Sacrifices</a></b><br>Reflect on how the sin and burnt offerings symbolize atonement and dedication, fulfilled in Christ's sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/atonement_and_forgiveness.htm">Atonement and Forgiveness</a></b><br>Embrace the assurance of forgiveness and cleansing through faith in Jesus, who fulfills the Law's requirements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_sacrifices.htm">Living Sacrifices</a></b><br>Apply the principle of the burnt offering by dedicating our lives wholly to God as an act of worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_15_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 15:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_15_Ritual_purity_s_role.htm">How does Leviticus 15:15 highlight the importance of ritual purity in worship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_turtledoves_pigeons_in_atonement.htm">What role do the "two turtledoves or two young pigeons" play in atonement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_purification_daily.htm">How can we apply the principles of purification in our daily spiritual lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_15_15_and_New_Testament_link.htm">How does Leviticus 15:15 connect to New Testament teachings on cleanliness and holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Priest_s_role_in_Lev_15_15_leadership.htm">What does the priest's role in Leviticus 15:15 teach about spiritual leadership today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ritual_s_modern_meaning_in_Leviticus_15_15.htm">What is the significance of the ritual in Leviticus 15:15 for modern believers?

Therefore, cleansing is still necessary (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The sin offering foreshadows Jesus, &#8220;who knew no sin&#8221; yet was &#8220;made sin for us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the other as a burnt offering</b><p>&#8226; A burnt offering is wholly consumed (<a href="/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8-9</a>), symbolizing total surrender and renewed fellowship.<p>&#8226; Pairing it with the sin offering teaches that forgiveness (sin offering) is inseparable from consecration (burnt offering).
