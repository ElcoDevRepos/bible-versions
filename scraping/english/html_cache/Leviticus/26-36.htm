In the context of <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, God outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The survivors are those who have experienced the latter. This concept of a remnant is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>, where a remnant returns to God. It highlights God's mercy and the hope of restoration despite judgment.<p><b>I will send a faintness into their hearts</b><br>The "faintness" refers to a state of fear and anxiety. This psychological consequence is part of the divine judgment. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>, a similar curse is described, emphasizing the internal turmoil that accompanies external oppression. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true peace and security come from obedience to God, not merely from external circumstances.<p><b>in the lands of their enemies</b><br>This phrase indicates exile, a significant theme in Israel's history. The Babylonian exile is a primary example, where the Israelites were taken from their land due to disobedience. The land of their enemies becomes a place of punishment and reflection. This exile motif is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are described as exiles in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>), emphasizing the temporary nature of earthly life and the call to live in obedience to God.<p><b>so that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight</b><br>This hyperbolic imagery illustrates extreme fear and paranoia. It signifies a lack of peace and security, where even the smallest disturbance causes panic. This condition contrasts with the peace promised to those who trust in God (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>). The imagery serves as a vivid reminder of the consequences of turning away from God&#8217;s protection.<p><b>And they will flee as one flees the sword</b><br>This phrase underscores the irrational fear that grips those under judgment. The comparison to fleeing from a sword suggests a life lived in constant threat, even when no real danger is present. This reflects the spiritual truth that without God, people are vulnerable to fear and insecurity. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance from fear through Christ, who offers peace beyond understanding (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><b>and fall when no one pursues them</b><br>This final phrase highlights the futility and self-destructive nature of living apart from God. The idea of falling without pursuit suggests a collapse from within, a spiritual and moral failure. It echoes the warnings in <a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>, where the wicked flee though no one pursues, while the righteous are bold as a lion. This serves as a call to repentance and reliance on God for true stability and courage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, the Israelites are God's chosen people, receiving His laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered God's laws to the Israelites, including the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

This reflects the spiritual truth that sin separates us from the peace of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_a_guilty_conscience.htm">The Power of a Guilty Conscience</a></b><br>A guilty conscience can cause irrational fear and anxiety. This verse illustrates how sin can distort our perception of reality, leading to unnecessary panic and distress.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commandments brings peace and security. The Israelites' experience serves as a warning to remain faithful to God's Word to avoid the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and just in His judgments.

rather, it underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises&#8212;even in chastening (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>- The text reminds us that physical preservation apart from obedience can still involve hard consequences, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/28-62.htm">Deuteronomy 28:62&#8211;63</a> where few remain yet still taste the curse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies</b><p>- &#8220;Faintness&#8221; points to divinely-induced terror and emotional collapse; God Himself is the source of this panic (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/53-5.htm">Psalm 53:5</a>).<p>- Being &#8220;in the lands of their enemies&#8221;

The verse fulfills covenant warnings, shows exile&#8217;s reality, and demonstrates that estrangement from God turns promised victory into dread. Restoration, therefore, requires repentance and renewed trust in the Lord, the only source of true courage and peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36, 37) <span class= "bld">And upon them that are left alive of you.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And as to those that remain of you, </span>as the Authorised Version generally renders this expression.
