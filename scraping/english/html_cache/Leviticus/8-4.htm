His actions reflect a direct response to God's instructions, emphasizing the importance of following divine commands precisely. This obedience is a model for leadership and faithfulness, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people prefigures Christ's mediatory role in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<p><b>and the assembly gathered</b><br>The gathering of the assembly signifies the communal aspect of worship and covenantal life in Israel. This assembly likely included the elders and representatives of the tribes, highlighting the collective responsibility and participation in the religious life of the nation. The concept of assembly is echoed in the New Testament with the gathering of believers, the ecclesia, or church (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>).<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. Its location at the center of the camp symbolized God's centrality in the life of the nation. The entrance was a significant place for divine encounters and communication, as seen in various instances where God spoke to Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9-11</a>). The Tabernacle foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate His laws.

Moses carried out God&#8217;s instructions without delay or alteration, echoing <a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>, &#8220;Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him&#8221;.<p>- This pattern of obedience had characterized Moses since the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10&#8211;12</a>) and would continue through the wilderness years (<a href="/numbers/27-22.htm">Numbers 27:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- The statement underscores that God&#8217;s commands are to be taken literally and acted upon wholly, reflecting <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>, which warns against adding to or subtracting from His word.<p>- For God&#8217;s people today, the principle remains: Jesus said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Obedience demonstrates trust and love, just as <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> urges believers to &#8220;be doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Assembly Gathered</b><p>- The entire congregation of Israel came together, showing that God&#8217;s covenant community was expected to witness and affirm what He was doing (cf. <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>, where &#8220;all the people&#8221; responded together; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11&#8211;13</a>, commanding public readings of the Law).<p>- Corporate participation teaches that consecration is not a private act but a shared responsibility. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a> reminds Christians today &#8220;not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together&#8221; because collective worship and accountability strengthen faith.<p>- Gathering also serves as a visible reminder that God&#8217;s work among leaders&#8212;here, Aaron and his sons being set apart&#8212;directly affects and blesses the whole body (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, &#8220;a royal priesthood&#8221; applied to every believer).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the Entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>- The location is significant: the entrance was where sacrifices were brought (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>) and where God spoke with Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>- By assembling there, Israel recognized that everything about priestly service begins at the threshold of God&#8217;s presence. It was a public yet sacred space, bridging everyday life and divine holiness.<p>- Later, Jesus fulfills and surpasses this pattern: <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> describes Him &#8220;tabernacling&#8221; among us, and <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a> declares believers now have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place.<p>- The verse therefore invites every generation to approach God at His appointed place and manner, remembering that access is a gift established by His covenantal order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-4.htm">Leviticus 8:4</a> captures three linked truths: obedient leadership, unified participation, and reverent approach. Moses&#8217; exact compliance models wholehearted submission to God&#8217;s word. The assembly&#8217;s presence highlights the communal nature of covenant life. Gathering at the Tent&#8217;s entrance anchors everything in God&#8217;s chosen meeting point. Together, these elements show that consecration, worship, and service must align with God&#8217;s revealed pattern&#8212;then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And Moses did as the Lord commanded him.</span>--That is, he not only summoned Aaron and his sons, but had their holy vestments, the oil, and the sacrifices brought, which were necessary for the consecration.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to the entrance of the tent of meeting. </span>These representatives of the people, and as many more as the place would conveniently hold, occupied the ?court-yard, whilst the people at large who wished to witness the solemn consecration of the priesthood probably occupied the neighbouring places which overlooked the enclosure.
