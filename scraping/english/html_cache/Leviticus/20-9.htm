In ancient Israelite society, the family unit was foundational, and respect for parents was seen as respect for God's ordained order. Cursing, in this context, implies a severe form of disrespect or rebellion, not merely using foul language but invoking harm or wishing evil upon one's parents. This reflects the gravity of maintaining familial and societal harmony.<p><b>he must be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment highlights the seriousness with which God views the breakdown of family respect and authority. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such severe penalties were not uncommon for actions that threatened the social fabric. This law served as a deterrent, emphasizing the sanctity of the family and the community's role in upholding divine commandments. It also reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, which seeks to maintain purity and order among God's people.<p><b>He has cursed his father or mother</b><br>Repetition of the offense underscores its gravity and the certainty of the transgression. This mirrors the biblical principle that words have power and consequences (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). The act of cursing one's parents is seen as a direct violation of God's command and an affront to the divine order, warranting the community's intervention.<p><b>his blood shall be upon him</b><br>This phrase indicates personal responsibility for one's actions. The individual bears the guilt and consequences of their sin, a concept echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). It also implies that the community, in executing judgment, is not held accountable for the death, as the transgressor has brought it upon themselves. This principle of justice is seen in the broader biblical narrative, where sin leads to death, but through Christ, believers find redemption and life (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the laws in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, living in the wilderness at the time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the commandments found in Leviticus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who established the covenant with Israel and provided the laws for holy living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/parents.htm">Parents (Father and Mother)</a></b><br>The immediate family members whom the law specifically mentions as deserving of honor and respect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_family_relationships.htm">The Sanctity of Family Relationships</a></b><br>The family unit is foundational in God's design, and honoring parents is crucial for maintaining its sanctity.

His use of the verse shows the moral principle did not expire with the old covenant.<p>&#8226; The statement is open-ended&#8212;&#8220;anyone&#8221;&#8212;signaling that neither age, status, nor gender excuses dishonor.<p>&#8226; By addressing fathers and mothers together, the text upholds equal parental authority, echoing <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a> and <a href="/colossians/3-20.htm">Colossians 3:20</a>, where children are urged to obey &#8220;in the Lord, for this is right.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must be put to death</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;he must be put to death.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Under Israel&#8217;s theocratic law, capital punishment safeguarded family and societal stability (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; This penalty underscores the seriousness with which God views parental authority; an attack on the home was an attack on the covenant community itself.<p>&#8226; The civil sanction also foreshadows the universal truth that &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). God ties blatant rebellion to the ultimate consequence.<p>&#8226; While today&#8217;s governments are not bound to apply Mosaic civil penalties, <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> teaches that the state still bears the sword to restrain evil.

Justice is satisfied; societal hands are clean.<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where taking life incurs life, highlighting God&#8217;s commitment to uphold His image in humanity.<p>&#8226; It anticipates the substitutionary hope later fulfilled in Christ. Though we all deserve to have our blood upon ourselves, &#8220;God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), so that repentant rebels can be forgiven.<p>&#8226; The warning therefore becomes an invitation: honor the Son who honored His Father perfectly (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>) and find refuge in His shed blood instead of bearing our own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a> presents more than an ancient legal code; it reveals God&#8217;s heart for ordered families, personal responsibility, and reverence for authority.

The verse calls every generation to honor father and mother, to recognize the lethal seriousness of rebellion, and to flee to Christ&#8212;who bore the guilt of the disobedient&#8212;so that we might live lives that display the honor God deserves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For every one that curseth his father.</span>--Though the administrators of the Law during the second Temple have laid down the most minute regulation with regard to filial obedience (see <a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm" title="You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:3</a>), and though nothing can exceed the tenderness with which they instilled into the hearts of children the Biblical precepts on this subject (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>), yet they enacted that the child only incurred the penalty of death when he used the ineffable name God when cursing his parent, who was either alive or dead, and that if he used an attribute of the Deity, such as Almighty, the Merciful, <span class= "ital">&c, </span>he was simply to be beaten with stripes.
