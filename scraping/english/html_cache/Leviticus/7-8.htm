The burnt offering, or "olah," was a voluntary act of worship, atonement, and dedication to God. The priest's duty was to present the offering on behalf of the individual, symbolizing the transfer of sin and the need for divine forgiveness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of mediation, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>the hide of that offering belongs to him</b><br>The hide of the burnt offering was a practical provision for the priest. In ancient Israel, priests did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Instead, they relied on portions of the offerings for their sustenance. The hide, a valuable commodity, could be used for clothing or trade. This provision underscores God's care for those who serve Him, a principle echoed in the New Testament where ministers of the gospel are supported by the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). The allocation of the hide also highlights the principle of sharing in the benefits of one's labor, a theme seen throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The individual responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals in the Tabernacle, serving as a mediator between God and the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament where the entire animal was consumed by fire, symbolizing atonement and complete surrender to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God during their journey through the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_provision.htm">Priestly Provision</a></b><br>The hide of the burnt offering was a provision for the priest, acknowledging their service and dedication.
