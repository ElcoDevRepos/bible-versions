In the Levitical system, certain portions of sacrifices were designated for the priests and their families (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>). The sacred offerings were holy and meant to be consumed only by those who were ritually clean and authorized. The concept of unintentional sin is significant in the Old Testament, highlighting human fallibility and the need for atonement (<a href="/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-29</a>). This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision for human error and the importance of maintaining holiness.<p><b>he must add a fifth to its value</b><br>The requirement to add a fifth (20%) to the value of the consumed offering serves as restitution and a penalty for the error. This principle of restitution is seen elsewhere in the Mosaic Law, such as in <a href="/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16</a> and <a href="/numbers/5-7.htm">Numbers 5:7</a>, emphasizing justice and the restoration of what was lost or misused. The additional fifth underscores the seriousness of maintaining the sanctity of what is holy and the need for accountability in the community.<p><b>and give the sacred offering to the priest</b><br>The restitution is to be given to the priest, restoring the loss of the sacred offering. This act reaffirms the priest's role as a mediator between God and the people, a role that foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The priesthood in Israel was a type of Christ, pointing to His future work as the High Priest who would offer Himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>). This requirement also highlights the communal aspect of worship and the support of those who serve in the temple, ensuring that the priests could continue their sacred duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests were the descendants of Aaron, responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and later the temple.

He thus acknowledged that he had "committed a trespass in the holy things of the Lord," the case falling under the rule given in chapter Leviticus 5:15, 16, "And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest." In the fifth chapter a trespass offering of a ram is also ordered, which, though not specified, is probably understood here also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/22-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
