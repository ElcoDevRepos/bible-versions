The law demonstrates God's compassion and justice, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their economic status, can participate in the sacrificial system. This reflects the broader biblical principle of caring for the poor, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a> and <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>.<p><b>he is to take one male lamb as a guilt offering</b><br>The male lamb as a guilt offering signifies the need for atonement and reconciliation with God. The guilt offering, or "asham," is specifically for unintentional sins or sins requiring restitution. The lamb is a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, symbolizing Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>to be waved to make atonement for him</b><br>The waving of the offering is a ritual act signifying the presentation of the sacrifice to God. This act of atonement is central to the sacrificial system, emphasizing the need for purification and forgiveness.

The use of fine flour indicates the offering of one's best, and the olive oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit. This offering complements the guilt offering, highlighting the holistic nature of worship and devotion.<p><b>a log of olive oil</b><br>A log is a unit of measurement, approximately equivalent to about a third of a liter. Olive oil was a valuable commodity in ancient Israel, used for anointing, cooking, and lighting lamps. In this context, it is part of the purification process, symbolizing the presence and blessing of God. Olive oil's significance is seen throughout Scripture, including its use in anointing kings and priests, foreshadowing the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Poverty does not bar anyone from cleansing, atonement, dedication, or Spirit-empowered living. A single lamb, a handful of flour, and a small jar of oil are enough when God Himself ordains the substitute, receives the offering, and supplies the anointing. The verse assures every believer&#8212;regardless of means&#8212;that full forgiveness, fellowship, and Spirit-filled service are freely provided through the perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And if he be poor.</span>--The benign consideration for the poor which has been evinced on former occasions in connection with the sacrifices (see <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm" title="And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he has committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/5-11.htm" title="But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:11</a>, Lev. 12:18) is also shown here. Three lambs and three tenth deals of flour were more than a poor leper could afford to bring. In such cases, therefore, all that was required was one lamb, which constituted the trespass offering, and one tenth deal of flour for a meat offering, and the log of oil which was needed for his consecration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if he be poor, and cannot get so much.</span> The concession to poverty consists in the substitution of two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, for the two lambs required for the sin offering and the burnt offering, and one tenth-deal of flour for three tenth-deals of flour in the meat offering. But no difference is made as to the lamb required for the trespass offering, or the log of oil. These must be provided by the poor as well as by the rich, and the ceremonies used at their offering must be the same for poor and rich, as they are essential to the rite, <p> CHAPTER 14:33-57 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
