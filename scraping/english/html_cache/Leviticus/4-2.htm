The Israelites are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they are in a covenant relationship with God. This covenant is central to their identity and their understanding of God's expectations for them. The instructions given here are part of the Mosaic Law, which was intended to set them apart as a holy nation.<p><b>to do as follows</b><br>This indicates that specific instructions are about to be given. The Law provided detailed guidelines for various aspects of life, including worship, morality, and community living. These instructions were not merely suggestions but were commands that required obedience. The specificity of the Law underscores the importance of holiness and order in the community.<p><b>with one who sins unintentionally</b><br>The concept of unintentional sin highlights the difference between sins committed knowingly and those done in ignorance or by accident. In the ancient Near Eastern context, intent was significant in determining guilt and the necessary atonement. This provision shows God's grace and understanding of human fallibility. It also emphasizes the need for continual awareness and repentance, as even unintentional sins required atonement.<p><b>against any of the LORD&#8217;s commandments</b><br>The commandments refer to the laws given by God, which include the Ten Commandments and other laws detailed in the Torah. These commandments cover moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of life. Sinning against these commandments is seen as an offense against God Himself, as they are His direct instructions. This underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement.<p><b>and does what is forbidden by them:</b><br>This phrase indicates a violation of the commandments, whether knowingly or unknowingly. The Law was clear about what was permissible and what was not, and any transgression required a response. This reflects the holiness of God and the need for His people to live in accordance with His standards. The sacrificial system, which included offerings for unintentional sins, pointed to the need for a mediator and ultimately foreshadowed the atoning work of Jesus Christ, who provides the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and commandments were given.
