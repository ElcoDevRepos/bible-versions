In ancient Israel, the community was seen as a covenant people, bound together in their relationship with God. The concept of unintentional sin highlights the human propensity to err, even without malicious intent. This reflects the need for communal awareness and vigilance in maintaining faithfulness to God's laws. The idea of corporate sin is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where the sin of one affected the entire community.<p><b>and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly</b><br>The assembly refers to the gathered leaders or representatives of the people, such as the elders. This indicates that even leaders can overlook transgressions, emphasizing the importance of discernment and accountability within the community. The oversight of sin suggests a need for constant spiritual vigilance. This concept is mirrored in the New Testament, where church leaders are called to be watchful and shepherd the flock (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<p><b>so that they violate any of the LORD&#8217;s commandments</b><br>The commandments of the LORD are central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Violating these commandments, even unintentionally, disrupts this relationship. The commandments are not merely legalistic rules but are meant to guide the people in living a life that reflects God's holiness. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where obedience to God's law is a sign of love and devotion (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>and incur guilt by doing what is forbidden</b><br>Guilt in this context is not just a feeling but a legal and spiritual state that requires atonement. The sacrificial system in Leviticus provides a means for addressing this guilt, pointing to the need for reconciliation with God. This foreshadows the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, who, as the perfect sacrifice, takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>). The concept of forbidden actions underscores the holiness of God and the seriousness of sin, which separates humanity from Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Whole Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the collective body of the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are bound by the covenant to follow His commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/unintentional_sin.htm">Unintentional Sin</a></b><br>This is a sin committed without deliberate intent, highlighting human fallibility and the need for atonement even when sin is not premeditated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The gathering of Israelite leaders and representatives who are responsible for maintaining the community's adherence to God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_commandments.htm">The LORD&#8217;s Commandments</a></b><br>The divine laws given by God to the Israelites, which they are required to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilt_and_atonement.htm">Guilt and Atonement</a></b><br>The state of being guilty due to sin and the subsequent need for atonement, which in the context of Leviticus, involves specific sacrificial rituals.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Even unintentional sins are serious in God's eyes and require atonement.

The case here assumed is that of the whole congregation having ignorantly committed some act which at the time of its committal they believed to be lawful, but which they afterwards discovered to be sinful. The two terms respectively rendered in the Authorised Version by <span class= "ital">congregation </span>and <span class= "ital">assembly </span>denote the same body of people, and are used interchangeably, so that the same congregation or assembly which inadvertently committed the sin afterwards recognised it.

An instance of such a national and congregational sin is recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32</a>, where we are told that the Israelites, after smiting the Philistines, "flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground, and the people did eat them with the blood." According to the ancient interpretation, however, which obtained at the time of Christ, "the whole congregation of Israel" and "the assembly" here spoken of denote the great Sanhedrin, the representatives of the people, who, through error, might proclaim a decree calculated to mislead the nation, thus accounting for the apparent discrepancy between this passage and <a href="/context/numbers/15-22.htm" title="And if you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,">Numbers 15:22-26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-21.</span> - The case of the whole congregation.
