The priests were required to maintain a high level of ritual purity to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple. Skin diseases, often translated as "leprosy" in older versions, could refer to a variety of skin conditions, not just Hansen's disease. Discharges could include any bodily fluid that rendered a person ceremonially unclean. The emphasis on purity underscores the holiness required to approach God, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for His people to be set apart.<p><b>he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean</b><br>The sacred offerings refer to portions of sacrifices that were designated for the priests and their families. Eating these offerings was both a privilege and a responsibility, symbolizing participation in the covenant community. The requirement for the priest to be clean before partaking highlights the importance of purity in worship and service. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to examine themselves before partaking in the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>).<p><b>Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse</b><br>Contact with a dead body rendered a person ceremonially unclean, as death is the antithesis of the life and holiness of God. This regulation served as a constant reminder of the consequences of sin, which is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The need for purification after such contact points to the necessity of cleansing from sin, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through the atoning work of Jesus Christ, who conquered death and offers eternal life.<p><b>or by a man who has an emission of semen</b><br>This part of the verse addresses another source of ritual impurity. Emissions, like other bodily discharges, were considered unclean, not because they were sinful, but because they were part of the natural processes that could not coexist with the holiness required in the presence of God. This regulation emphasizes the separation between the sacred and the profane, a recurring theme in Leviticus. In the New Testament, the focus shifts from external purity to internal, spiritual purity, as seen in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, brother of Moses, and ancestor of the Levitical priesthood.
