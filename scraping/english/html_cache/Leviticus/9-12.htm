The burnt offering, or "olah" in Hebrew, was a sacrifice of atonement, symbolizing complete surrender to God. This act of slaughtering the offering was a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as He was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire, representing total dedication and the need for purification from sin.<p><b>His sons brought him the blood,</b><br>Aaron's sons, the priests, assisted in the sacrificial process, highlighting the importance of the priestly family in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The blood, representing life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), was central to the atonement process. This act prefigures the New Testament understanding of Christ's blood as the means of atonement for humanity's sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and he splattered it on all sides of the altar.</b><br>The act of splattering the blood on the altar was a ritual of consecration and purification. The altar, a central place of worship, needed to be sanctified by the blood, symbolizing the cleansing power necessary for approaching a holy God. This ritual act points to the comprehensive nature of Christ's atoning work, which cleanses believers from all sin (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>).
