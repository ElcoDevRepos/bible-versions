The mention of a saddle here indicates the practical aspects of daily life and the need for purity in all areas. Saddles were typically made of leather or woven materials, which could easily absorb impurities, making them a focus in the laws of cleanliness.<p><b>on which the man with the discharge rides</b><br>The discharge refers to a bodily fluid that rendered a person ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law. This condition could be due to illness or other natural causes. The emphasis on riding highlights the transmission of impurity through contact, underscoring the importance of avoiding contamination. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from impurity, as seen in passages like <a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>.<p><b>will be unclean</b><br>The concept of uncleanness in Leviticus is not merely about physical hygiene but also about spiritual and communal purity. Uncleanness required purification rituals to restore a person to full participation in the community and worship. This reflects the holiness of God and the need for His people to be set apart, as echoed in <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>, "Be holy, because I am holy."

The word &#8220;any&#8221; reflects the comprehensiveness already seen in previous verses about beds and seats (<a href="/leviticus/15-4.htm">Leviticus 15:4-6, 8</a>).<p>&#8226; A saddle covers more than a riding blanket; it represents whatever a person sits on while traveling&#8212;much like &#8220;any article&#8221; touched by a carcass in <a href="/leviticus/11-32.htm">Leviticus 11:32</a>.<p>&#8226; By singling out transportation gear, the law guards the community&#8217;s shared spaces&#8212;roads, beasts of burden, and communal belongings&#8212;just as rules about cooking vessels protect kitchens (<a href="/leviticus/11-33.htm">Leviticus 11:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on which the man with the discharge rides</b><p>&#8226; The impurity is tied to the individual, not the object itself. <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2-3</a> defines this &#8220;discharge&#8221; as an abnormal flow, likely chronic and infectious.<p>&#8226; Contact spreads ceremonial uncleanness: beds (v 4), seats (v 6), and now saddles&#8212;anything supporting weight. The same principle excludes lepers from the camp (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>) and removes anyone with bodily emission until cleansing (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By linking impurity to riding, the text recognizes mobility. When the afflicted person moves, the impurity moves with him. This protects the wider congregation, anticipating Jesus&#8217; day when an unclean woman touches His cloak amid a crowd (<a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be unclean</b><p>&#8226; The saddle becomes &#8220;unclean&#8221; until properly washed and left until evening (<a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a>).

By covering &#8220;any saddle,&#8221; the Lord safeguards the community, underscores personal responsibility, and highlights the pervasive reach of impurity. The regulation points to humanity&#8217;s continual need for cleansing, ultimately fulfilled in the perfect purity and atoning work of Christ, who alone makes the unclean clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And what saddle soever.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and any carriage. </span>The word here translated "saddle" only occurs twice more: viz., <a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm" title="Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.">1Kings 5:6</a> in Hebrew, or <a href="/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a> in English, where it is rendered "chariot" in the Authorised Version, and in <a href="/songs/3-10.htm" title="He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the middle thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.">Song of Solomon 3:10</a>, where it is translated "covering" but where it manifestly denotes the seat inside the palanquin. With the feminine termination the word in question occurs no less than forty-four times, and is invariably translated in the Authorised Version "chariot." What kind of vehicle the masculine form of the expression in question denotes in the three passages in which it occurs must be decided from the context. In Kings, the horses which are used in connection with it show that it was a carriage drawn by animals. In Canticles it is a vehicle, or the essential part of it, carried by men, and this is the kind of vehicle meant in the passage before us. It is the well-known palanquin so largely used in the East.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be unclean.</span>--The conveyance used is to be unclean, and hence, is not to be used by any one else. It will be seen that the present text does not say how long the vehicle is to be defiled, though in every other instance the time is fixed. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/15-5.htm" title="And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:5-11</a>.) There can, therefore, hardly be any doubt that the reading in the LXX., which has here <span class= "ital">until evening, </span>is the original one, and that the words have dropped out of the Hebrew text.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
