In the ancient Israelite context, leprosy rendered a person ceremonially unclean, separating them from the community and worship. The cleansing process symbolizes restoration and reintegration into the community.<p><b>must wash his clothes</b><br>Washing clothes was a common purification ritual in the Old Testament, symbolizing the removal of impurity. This act signifies a fresh start and a break from the past condition of uncleanness.<p><b>shave off all his hair</b><br>Shaving all hair, including the head, beard, and eyebrows, was a sign of complete purification and renewal. It represents the removal of the old self and the beginning of a new life. This act is similar to the Nazirite vow in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where hair is shaved as a sign of dedication to God.<p><b>and bathe with water</b><br>Bathing in water is a recurring theme in purification rites, symbolizing spiritual cleansing and renewal. Water is often associated with life and purity in the Bible, as seen in the baptism of Jesus, which signifies the washing away of sin.<p><b>then he will be ceremonially clean</b><br>This phrase indicates the completion of the cleansing process, allowing the individual to be considered pure and able to participate in religious and communal life. It reflects the importance of holiness and purity in maintaining a relationship with God.<p><b>Afterward, he may enter the camp</b><br>Re-entry into the camp signifies the restoration of the individual to the community. The camp represents the collective life of Israel, and being outside it symbolizes separation from God's people. This mirrors the spiritual restoration believers experience through Christ.<p><b>but he must remain outside his tent for seven days</b><br>The seven-day period is a time of transition and further purification. The number seven often represents completeness and perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week. This waiting period ensures the individual is fully prepared to rejoin family life, reflecting the thoroughness of God's cleansing process.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_being_cleansed.htm">The One Being Cleansed</a></b><br>This refers to a person who has been healed from a skin disease, often translated as leprosy, and is undergoing the purification process as prescribed by the Mosaic Law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>Represents the community of Israel, where the presence of God dwelt among His people.

The verse foreshadows the fuller cleansing Christ secures, inviting believers to live out the holiness He has already given.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Shall wash his clothes.</span>--This was done not to disinfect them, for leprosy, as we have seen, was not contagious, but as an act of purification, which was performed after every kind of defilement. (See <a href="/leviticus/6-20.htm" title="This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.">Leviticus 6:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm" title="And whoever bears ought of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 11:25</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">And shave off all his hair.</span>--The razor had to pass over the whole of his body, even his secret parts. A similar process was undertaken at the consecration of the Levites. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/8-7.htm" title="And thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying on them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.">Numbers 8:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And shall tarry abroad out of his tent</span>--But though permitted to return to the camp, yet he had to live the first week out of his own house. This the authorities during the second Temple rightly regarded as an euphemism for seclusion from connubial intercourse during the first seven days, in order that he might not contract impurity (see <a href="/leviticus/15-10.htm" title="And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that bears any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:10</a>), and thus interrupt the period of holy preparation. Hence the ancient Chaldee Version of the so-called Jonathan translates it: "He shall sit without the tent of the house of his habitation, and shall not come near to the side of his wife seven days." With this ended the first stage of purification, which restored the convalescent to his social or civil privileges, but not to the sanctuary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - After the healed leper has <span class="cmt_word">washed his clothes, and shaved off all his hair, and washed himself with water,</span> so as to leave no remnant of his former defilement that can be removed, the first stage of his purification is over. He is restored to the camp, but not yet to the sanctuary, nor to his position as head or member of his family. He has still to undergo another week's purgation, and until that time has elapsed he may not live in his tent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The one being cleansed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1496;&#1468;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mi&#7789;&#183;&#7789;a&#183;h&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
