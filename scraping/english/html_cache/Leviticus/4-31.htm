Fat was considered the richest part of the animal, representing abundance and blessing. This act signifies giving God the choicest portions, reflecting the principle of offering our best to Him. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, fat was often associated with wealth and prosperity, making its offering a significant gesture of devotion.<p><b>just as it is removed from the peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, or "shelamim," was a voluntary sacrifice expressing thanksgiving and fellowship with God. The removal of fat in both the sin offering and the peace offering indicates a consistent ritual practice, emphasizing the importance of purity and dedication in worship. This connection highlights the continuity and unity of the sacrificial system, where different offerings share common elements, pointing to a holistic approach to atonement and worship.<p><b>and the priest is to burn it on the altar</b><br>The burning of the fat on the altar signifies the complete surrender of the offering to God. Fire in biblical symbolism often represents God's presence and purification. The altar, central to Israelite worship, serves as the meeting point between God and man, where sacrifices are made to atone for sin and express devotion. This act of burning transforms the physical offering into a spiritual one, ascending to God.<p><b>as a pleasing aroma to the LORD</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, indicating God's acceptance of the sacrifice. It suggests that the offering, when made according to God's instructions, is received favorably by Him. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a "fragrant offering" (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), drawing a parallel between the Old Testament sacrifices and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<p><b>In this way the priest will make atonement for him</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through the sacrificial system. The priest acts as a mediator, performing the ritual to cover the sins of the individual. This foreshadows the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest, who makes atonement for humanity through His sacrifice on the cross, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>.<p><b>and he will be forgiven</b><br>Forgiveness is the ultimate goal of the sacrificial system, restoring the relationship between the sinner and God. This assurance of forgiveness reflects God's mercy and grace, foundational themes throughout Scripture. The concept of forgiveness through sacrifice is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Jesus' death and resurrection provide complete and eternal forgiveness for those who believe, as seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between the people and God, performing the sacrificial rituals necessary for atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The place where sacrifices are offered to God, symbolizing His presence and the means of atonement.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament that symbolizes fellowship and reconciliation with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process by which sin is covered or forgiven, restoring the relationship between the sinner and God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are given the law and instructions for maintaining a covenant relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The concept of atonement in Leviticus points to the seriousness of sin and the need for a mediator.
