Biblically, the number eight often symbolizes new creation or a new order, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus, which occurred on the first day of the week, the day after the Sabbath (<a href="/john/20.htm">John 20:1</a>). This day marks the commencement of Aaron's priestly duties, indicating a transition from preparation to active service.<p><b>Moses summoned Aaron and his sons</b><br>Moses, acting as God's appointed leader and mediator, calls Aaron and his sons to begin their priestly ministry. This highlights the importance of divine calling and preparation for service. Aaron, as the high priest, is a type of Christ, our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). The summoning also emphasizes the necessity of obedience to God's instructions, as Aaron and his sons had to follow the detailed commands given by God through Moses.<p><b>and the elders of Israel</b><br>The elders represent the leadership and authority within the Israelite community. Their presence underscores the communal aspect of worship and the importance of accountability and witness in religious practices. This gathering of leaders also reflects the structure of the early church, where elders played a crucial role in governance and spiritual oversight (<a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, <a href="/1_peter/5.htm">1 Peter 5:1-3</a>).

His own sin offering is a <span class="cmt_word">young calf</span>, or young bull calf, whereas the sin offering commanded for the high priest on ordinary occasions was a young bull, further advanced in age (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>); and in presenting the blood he does not take it into the sanctuary according to the regulations in chapter Leviticus 4:6, but uses it as Moses had done in the sin offerings of the previous week, the purpose of the difference being to show that Aaron's full dignity had not yet devolved upon him. This did not take place until he had gone into the tabernacle with Moses (verse 23). <span class="cmt_word">A ram</span> is again taken for the burnt offering, as had been the case in Moses' sacrifice of the previous week.
