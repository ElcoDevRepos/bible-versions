The prohibition against such acts is rooted in the creation order, where God established distinct boundaries between humans and animals (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>). Bestiality is seen as a violation of the natural order and an affront to the sanctity of human sexuality, which is intended to reflect the covenant relationship between God and His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>). The act is also considered a form of idolatry, as it distorts the image of God in humanity and corrupts the intended purpose of creation.<p><b>he must be put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment of death underscores the severity of the offense in the eyes of God. In the context of ancient Israel, capital punishment served as a deterrent to prevent the spread of practices that could lead to moral and spiritual decay within the community. The death penalty for such acts is consistent with other severe prohibitions in the Law, such as those against idolatry and murder (<a href="/exodus/22-19.htm">Exodus 22:19</a>, <a href="/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>). This reflects the holiness code in Leviticus, which emphasizes the need for Israel to be set apart as a holy nation (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>And you are also to kill the animal</b><br>The command to kill the animal involved in the act serves multiple purposes. It removes the object of the sin from the community, preventing any further defilement or association with the act. This also reflects the principle of purging evil from among the people, a recurring theme in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>). Additionally, the killing of the animal may symbolize the eradication of the sin itself, emphasizing the need for purity and holiness in the community. This action can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He bore the sins of humanity to cleanse and sanctify His people (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including those in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the laws in Leviticus were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where they were to live according to God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/animals.htm">Animals</a></b><br>Creatures that are mentioned in the context of prohibitions against certain behaviors.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br><a href="/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a> emphasizes the need for God's people to be holy and separate from the practices of surrounding nations.

Bestiality is not a vague moral lapse; it is a specific, deliberate crossing of the Creator&#8217;s boundaries (see <a href="/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-21.htm">Deuteronomy 27:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording shows that God holds people accountable for what they choose to do with their bodies, which are meant to bear His image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling it &#8220;lying carnally,&#8221; Scripture links the act to a misuse of the sexual gift. Sexuality was designed for husband and wife within marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>). Any distortion&#8212;whether adultery, homosexuality, or bestiality&#8212;is treated as rebellion against God&#8217;s created order (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he must be put to death</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; he must be put to death &#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a>b)<p>&#8226; Under Israel&#8217;s theocratic law, capital punishment underscored how seriously God views this sin (compare <a href="/exodus/22-19.htm">Exodus 22:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-13.htm">Leviticus 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The penalty protected the covenant community from corruption. Just as Achan&#8217;s sin brought trouble on Israel (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>), tolerated impurity invites judgment on all (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The severity also teaches a timeless spiritual truth: sin brings death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). While modern civil penalties differ, the moral weight has not changed; Christ bore that death penalty on our behalf (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By enforcing justice swiftly, the nation was reminded of God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>) and His zeal to guard human dignity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you are also to kill the animal</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; And you are also to kill the animal.&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a>c)<p>&#8226; The animal is not morally culpable, yet it is destroyed to remove contamination from the camp&#8212;similar to burning idolatrous objects (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-17</a>) and cleansing leprous houses (<a href="/leviticus/14-33.htm">Leviticus 14:33-45</a>).<p>&#8226; Eliminating the animal prevents further temptation and erases the memory of the act, safeguarding community purity (<a href="/leviticus/20-16.htm">Leviticus 20:16</a> mirrors this directive when a woman is involved).<p>&#8226; The step reminds Israel that sin defiles everything it touches (<a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>). God&#8217;s solution is radical removal, a principle echoed when Jesus urges believers to &#8220;cut off&#8221; whatever causes them to stumble (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/20-15.htm">Leviticus 20:15</a> condemns bestiality as a flagrant violation of God-given sexual boundaries, assigns capital punishment to emphasize the gravity of the offense, and commands the death of the animal to purge defilement from the covenant community. The verse highlights God&#8217;s holiness, the sanctity of human sexuality, and the lethal seriousness of sin&#8212;truths ultimately answered by Christ, who cleanses and restores all who turn to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) <span class= "bld">with a beast.</span>--See <a href="/leviticus/18-23.htm" title="Neither shall you lie with any beast to defile yourself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.">Leviticus 18:23</a><span class= "ital">.</span><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/20-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
