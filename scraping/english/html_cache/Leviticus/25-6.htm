During this year, the land is to lie fallow, and the Israelites are to trust in God's provision. This practice emphasizes reliance on God rather than human effort. It also serves as a reminder of the creation week, where God rested on the seventh day (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). The land's natural yield during this time is a testament to God's ongoing provision and care.<p><b>shall be food for you</b><br>The produce that grows naturally without cultivation is intended to sustain the people. This provision underscores the principle of divine providence, where God supplies the needs of His people. It also reflects the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16), where God supplied food without human labor. This reliance on God's provision is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of trusting God for daily needs (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>).<p><b>for yourself</b><br>The primary beneficiaries of the Sabbath year's yield are the landowners themselves. This ensures that even without active farming, the basic needs of the family are met. It highlights the personal aspect of God's care and provision for each individual.<p><b>your manservant and maidservant</b><br>Servants, who were often part of the household, are also included in this provision. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for those who work for you, ensuring that they too benefit from God's provision. It aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and kindness towards servants (<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, <a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>).<p><b>the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you</b><br>The inclusion of hired hands and foreigners demonstrates the inclusive nature of God's provision. It reflects the biblical mandate to care for the sojourner and the stranger (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>). This provision foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the gospel being available to all people, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). It also emphasizes the community's responsibility to ensure that everyone, regardless of status or origin, is cared for during the Sabbath year.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, including the instructions for the Sabbath year.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the laws for the Israelites, including the instructions for the Sabbath year.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_year.htm">Sabbath Year</a></b><br>A year of rest for the land, occurring every seventh year, during which the land was to lie fallow, and the people were to rely on what the land naturally produced.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where these laws were to be observed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The Sabbath year required the Israelites to trust that God would provide for their needs without their usual agricultural efforts.

During that year the Israelites are neither to sow nor reap for profit, yet the land will still &#8220;yield&#8221; on its own. This spontaneous produce is His promise of provision&#8212;similar to how He supplied manna in <a href="/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22&#8211;30</a> and multiplied oil and flour for the widow in <a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8&#8211;16</a>. The earth belongs to the Lord (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>), so He reserves the right to let it grow without human effort and still feed His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall be food for you</b><p>The Sabbath year was not about starvation or waste; it was about trust. Whatever sprouted naturally was &#8220;food,&#8221; not forbidden fruit. God&#8217;s people could gather enough for their daily needs, echoing the principle of <a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>, &#8220;I may test them to see whether they will walk in My law.&#8221; Dependence on the Lord&#8217;s schedule, not their own, kept greed in check and fostered gratitude (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25&#8211;34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for yourself</b><p>Each household head first ensured his own family&#8217;s sustenance (<a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>). Yet &#8220;yourself&#8221; here never meant hoarding. Just as <a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8&#8211;9</a> urges &#8220;daily bread,&#8221; the Sabbath year taught contentment: take what you need, leave the rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your manservant and maidservant</b><p>Employees and servants were to share equally in God&#8217;s bounty. This safeguards the dignity of laborers, reflecting <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14&#8211;15</a>, which forbids oppressing hired workers. In the Sabbath year all social tiers stand on level ground before their Provider.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you</b><p>God&#8217;s compassion extends beyond Israel. Resident aliens and day-laborers were to eat freely from the fields, paralleling the gleaning laws in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9&#8211;10</a> and <a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2&#8211;17</a>. By opening the pantry of the land to outsiders, Israel displayed the character of the Lord who &#8220;shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34&#8211;35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-6.htm">Leviticus 25:6</a> reassures that during the Sabbath year God Himself supplies food through the untended land. Every person&#8212;family, servant, worker, or stranger&#8212;is invited to partake equally. The verse calls believers to rest from striving, trust in divine provision, practice generosity, and bear witness to God&#8217;s inclusive care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And the sabbath of the land.</span>--That is, the growth or produce during this sabbath of the land. For the figure of speech see Lev. 18:38.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be meat for you.</span>--That is, it shall serve as your food, but you must not trade with it, or store it up. Hence, during the second Temple the produce of the sabbatical year could only be used for direct consumption, and was not allowed to be converted first into other articles and then used. Thus, for instance, though wood of that year could be used as firewood, yet it was illegal to convert it first into coal and then use the coal thus obtained from the wood, nor was it legal to convert vegetables into medicines, or to give human food to animals.<p><span class= "bld">For thee, and for thy servant . . . --</span>The produce is to be left in the field for the free use of the poor, the servant, &c. (See also <a href="/exodus/23-11.htm" title="But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your olive grove.">Exodus 23:11</a>.) Hence it was enacted during the second Temple that "whoso locks up his vineyard, or hedges in his field, or gathers all the fruit into his house in the sabbatical year breaks this law." Everything is to be left common, and every man has a right to every thing in every place. Every man could only bring into his house a little at a time according to the manner of things that are in common."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Whatever the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
