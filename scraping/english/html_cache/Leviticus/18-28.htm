The land of Canaan was a gift from God, a holy land meant to be inhabited by a holy people. Defilement refers to the moral and spiritual corruption that comes from sin, particularly the sins listed earlier in <a href="/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>, such as idolatry and sexual immorality. The land is seen as a living entity that can be tainted by the actions of its inhabitants. This reflects the broader biblical theme that sin has consequences not only for individuals but also for the community and the environment.<p><b>it will vomit you out</b><br>The imagery of the land vomiting out its inhabitants is vivid and powerful, suggesting a natural and inevitable reaction to impurity. This metaphor indicates that the land itself cannot tolerate sin and will expel those who defile it. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/20-22.htm">Leviticus 20:22</a>, where the Israelites are warned again about the consequences of disobedience. The idea of the land reacting to sin underscores the seriousness of maintaining holiness and the covenant with God.<p><b>as it spewed out the nations before you.</b><br>This phrase refers to the Canaanite nations that previously inhabited the land. According to biblical history, these nations were expelled due to their abominable practices, which included idolatry and various forms of immorality. The Israelites are reminded that they are not inherently more righteous than the nations they replaced; rather, their continued occupation of the land is contingent upon their obedience to God's laws. This serves as a warning and a call to holiness, emphasizing that God's standards are consistent and that His judgment is impartial. The historical context of the conquest of Canaan, as described in the books of Joshua and Judges, provides a backdrop for understanding the gravity of this warning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, receiving God's laws through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, which they were to enter and inhabit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanite_nations.htm">The Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The previous inhabitants of the land, who were expelled due to their abominations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver, establishing moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_the_land.htm">The Sanctity of the Land</a></b><br>The land is a gift from God, and its sanctity must be preserved by living according to His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Just as the Canaanites were expelled for their abominations, persistent sin leads to separation from God's blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_obedience.htm">Holiness and Obedience</a></b><br>God's people are called to live distinctively holy lives, reflecting His character and commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/corporate_responsibility.htm">Corporate Responsibility</a></b><br>The actions of individuals affect the community; thus, communal adherence to God's laws is crucial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While God is just in punishing sin, His mercy is evident in providing laws to guide His people toward righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_s_warning_on_sin_adoption.htm">How does Leviticus 18:28 warn against adopting sinful practices of other nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_consequences_for_sin.htm">What consequences does Leviticus 18:28 describe for defiling the land with sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_s_relevance_today.htm">How can we apply Leviticus 18:28 to modern cultural influences today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_Romans_1_24-27_links.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Leviticus 18:28 and Romans 1:24-27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_Uphold_God_s_standards.htm">How does Leviticus 18:28 encourage us to uphold God's standards in society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_God_s_judgment_on_nations.htm">What does Leviticus 18:28 imply about God's judgment on nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_28_and_divine_retribution.htm">How does Leviticus 18:28 relate to the concept of divine retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_land_s_defilement_key_in_Lev_18_28.htm">Why is the land's defilement significant in Leviticus 18:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_18.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_constitutes_sexual_immorality.htm">What constitutes sexual immorality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_displace_nations_for_israel.htm">In Exodus 23:23&#8211;31, why would a just God command the displacement of entire nations for Israel&#8217;s sake?
