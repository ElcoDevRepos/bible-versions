This act symbolizes the consecration and ordination of Aaron and his sons as priests. The laying of hands is a significant biblical gesture, often used to confer authority or blessing (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). It marks the beginning of their service in the tabernacle, highlighting the importance of the priesthood in mediating between God and the Israelites.<p><b>and waved them before the LORD</b><br>The wave offering is a specific type of sacrifice where the offering is moved back and forth before the altar. This act symbolizes presenting the offering to God and acknowledging His sovereignty. The wave offering is part of the peace offerings, which express fellowship and gratitude towards God (<a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-34</a>). The motion of waving signifies the offering being given to God and then returned to the priests for their sustenance, illustrating the reciprocal relationship between God and His people.<p><b>as a wave offering</b><br>The wave offering is a subset of the peace offerings, which were voluntary and expressed thanksgiving and fellowship. This particular offering is unique because it involves a physical motion that sets it apart from other sacrifices. The wave offering is a reminder of God's provision and the priest's role in facilitating the people's relationship with God. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who, as the perfect High Priest, offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>). The wave offering, therefore, points to the greater reality of Christ's atoning work and the peace it brings between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is performing the consecration ceremony for Aaron and his sons as priests.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, who is being consecrated as the high priest.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>They are being consecrated alongside Aaron to serve as priests.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, to whom the wave offering is presented.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering in the Levitical system, symbolizing the presentation and dedication of the offering to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_priests.htm">The Role of Priests</a></b><br>The consecration of Aaron and his sons highlights the importance of the priestly role in mediating between God and the people.

By literally gathering &#8220;all these,&#8221; the passage underscores that nothing God commanded for the ordination was omitted. Every piece mattered&#8212;mirroring how in <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a> God tells Moses to make everything &#8220;according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.&#8221; Nothing short of full obedience is acceptable when approaching a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the hands of Aaron and his sons</b><p>The new priests do not merely watch; they physically receive the portions.<p>&#8226; This transfer symbolizes stewardship: what once lay on God&#8217;s altar is now entrusted to human hands (<a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; It also pictures identification: the priests hold what will soon be offered, confessing that their ministry depends entirely on God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a> reminds us that only &#8220;clean hands&#8221; may stand in His presence).<p>&#8226; By placing the pieces in each man&#8217;s grasp, Moses visually confirms their shared calling&#8212;much like Paul laying hands on Timothy to affirm his ministry (<a href="/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and waved them</b><p>A wave offering involved moving the items forward and back, symbolically presenting them to God and receiving them back for service (<a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>, <a href="/exodus/29-24.htm">Exodus 29:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The motion declares: &#8220;These belong to You first.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It also announces: &#8220;You graciously return them for our benefit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This dual truth anticipates <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>: &#8220;For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the LORD</b><p>The ceremony takes place at the entrance to the tent of meeting where the cloud of God&#8217;s glory rested (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). By acting &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; the priests acknowledge His immediate presence&#8212;nothing is hidden from His gaze (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-8</a>). The setting reinforces reverence: ministry is never performed for an audience of people but for the Audience of One (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a wave offering</b><p>Calling it a &#8220;wave offering&#8221; distinguishes this act from other sacrifices:<p>&#8226; Portions are waved, not burned, signifying dedication rather than atonement (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests will consume part of what was waved (<a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>), displaying fellowship with God&#8212;He shares His table with them.<p>&#8226; Later, Israel will &#8220;wave&#8221; the first sheaf of barley at Passover (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>), showing that everything first and best belongs to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a> captures a profound moment: Moses gathers every commanded portion, places them in the newly ordained priests&#8217; hands, and they ceremonially wave the offering before God. The act proclaims total obedience, transferred stewardship, public dedication, and joyful fellowship. In simple motions, the verse teaches that ministry begins and ends with God&#8217;s provision, God&#8217;s presence, and God&#8217;s pleasure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/8-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
