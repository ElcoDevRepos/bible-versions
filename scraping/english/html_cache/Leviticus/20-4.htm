In the ancient Near Eastern context, the community was expected to uphold God's laws collectively. "Hiding their eyes" suggests a willful ignorance or neglect of duty, which is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of vigilance in maintaining holiness and justice within the community.<p><b>and fail to put to death</b><br>The prescribed punishment for giving a child to Molech was death, reflecting the severity of the crime. This command highlights the sanctity of life and the abhorrence of idolatry, particularly child sacrifice, which was prevalent among neighboring cultures like the Ammonites. The death penalty here serves as a deterrent and a means of purging evil from among the people, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>).<p><b>the man who gives one of his children to Molech</b><br>Molech worship involved detestable practices, including child sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). This act was not only a violation of God's commandments but also a betrayal of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The reference to Molech connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's struggle with idolatry and the call to exclusive worship of the one true God (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself willingly, contrasting with the forced sacrifices to Molech.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are living in the Promised Land.

The penalty is death, and is to be carried out by the proper tribunals, whose business it was to see that the stoning took place. So in Deuteronomy the duty of killing those who entice to idolatry is laid down. "Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shall thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people" (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-8.htm">Deuteronomy 13:8, 9</a>). In the case of Molech-worship God declares that, if the tribunals of the nation fail to adjudge the penalty of death to the offender, he will himself lake the matter into his hands, and cut him off with his family and all that follow him in his sin of unfaithfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1441;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
