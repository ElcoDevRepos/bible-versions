It was a year when debts were forgiven, slaves were freed, and land was returned to its original owners. This concept underscores God's desire for justice and mercy within the community. The Jubilee year is a reminder of God's sovereignty over the land and His provision for His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption and freedom found in Jesus Christ, who proclaimed the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>), symbolizing spiritual liberation.<p><b>he is to calculate and pay his redemption</b><br>The process of redemption involved a financial transaction to buy back one's freedom or property. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption, where God redeems His people from slavery and sin. The calculation of redemption price based on remaining years until Jubilee emphasizes fairness and justice in economic dealings. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is the ultimate redemption for humanity, paying the price for sin (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><b>according to his remaining years</b><br>The calculation based on remaining years until Jubilee ensured that the redemption price was fair and proportional. This reflects God's concern for equity and justice in His laws. It also highlights the temporary nature of earthly possessions and the importance of looking forward to ultimate redemption. The concept of time and remaining years can be seen as a metaphor for the brevity of life and the urgency of seeking spiritual redemption through Christ, who offers eternal life (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Levitical laws, including the regulations concerning the Year of Jubilee.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/year_of_jubilee.htm">Year of Jubilee</a></b><br>A significant event occurring every 50 years in Israel, where slaves were freed, debts forgiven, and land returned to original owners.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/redeemer.htm">Redeemer</a></b><br>A family member who could redeem a relative sold into slavery, reflecting the concept of redemption.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws of Leviticus to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where these laws were to be practiced by the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>The concept of redemption in <a href="/leviticus/25-52.htm">Leviticus 25:52</a> highlights God's provision for restoration and freedom.

When &#8220;only a few years remain,&#8221; Scripture narrows the focus to the closing stretch of that servitude. God refuses to let hardship linger longer than necessary. Similar concern appears when a Hebrew slave goes free in his seventh year (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>), underscoring that servitude among God&#8217;s people is always temporary and regulated for mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;until the Year of Jubilee</b><p>The Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>) is the grand reset when land returns to original families, debts are erased, and captives are released. By tying every individual circumstance to that fiftieth-year celebration, God keeps hope alive. Jesus echoes Jubilee language in announcing liberty to the captives (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>), showing that the principle of ultimate release culminates in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is to calculate and pay his redemption</b><p>Redemption is a concrete price that purchases freedom. A kinsman redeemer may pay it (<a href="/leviticus/25-48.htm">Leviticus 25:48&#8211;49</a>), or the debtor may raise it himself. The fairness of a calculable sum protects both parties and models the greater redemption God provides: &#8220;You were bought with a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). The procedure in <a href="/ruth/4-4.htm">Ruth 4:4&#8211;6</a> illustrates how redemption law worked in daily life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;according to his remaining years</b><p>The price is prorated: fewer years, smaller cost. God bans exploitation and insists on just balances (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>). Servitude must never outlast the debt itself. Job defends his integrity by citing such equity (<a href="/job/31-13.htm">Job 31:13&#8211;15</a>), and Paul reminds us that God shows no partiality (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>). The standard is strict yet compassionate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/25-52.htm">Leviticus 25:52</a> guarantees that when release is near, the cost of freedom drops proportionally, reflecting God&#8217;s justice and mercy.
