This type of offering was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, but in Israel, it held a unique covenantal significance. The offering from the herd indicates a domesticated animal, typically cattle, which were valuable assets, reflecting the offerer's willingness to give something of great worth to God. This act of sacrifice is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly for humanity's redemption.<p><b>he is to present an unblemished male</b><br>The requirement for an unblemished male animal underscores the importance of purity and perfection in offerings to God. This reflects God's holiness and the need for the worshiper to approach Him with integrity and sincerity. The male animal, often seen as the stronger and more valuable, symbolizes strength and leadership. This foreshadows Christ, the sinless and perfect Lamb of God, who was offered without blemish for the sins of the world (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>He must bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. Bringing the offering to the entrance signifies the worshiper's approach to God, acknowledging His presence and seeking communion with Him. This act of bringing the offering to a specific location highlights the importance of obedience and reverence in worship. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, as it was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>for its acceptance before the LORD</b><br>The acceptance of the offering by the LORD indicates divine approval and favor. This acceptance was contingent upon the offerer's obedience to God's instructions and the condition of the offering itself. It reflects the principle that God desires sincere worship and a heart aligned with His will. This acceptance is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, whose sacrifice was fully accepted by God, providing eternal redemption for believers (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the sacrifice, representing the people of Israel who seek to maintain a right relationship with God through offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire animal is consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication and atonement for sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unblemished_male.htm">Unblemished Male</a></b><br>The requirement for the offering to be without defect, symbolizing purity and perfection, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, representing God's presence among His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who establishes the terms of worship and acceptance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_for_purity.htm">The Call for Purity</a></b><br>Just as the offering had to be unblemished, believers are called to pursue holiness and purity in their lives, reflecting the character of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/total_dedication.htm">Total Dedication</a></b><br>The burnt offering symbolizes complete surrender to God.

First in order comes the burnt offering, which is divided into burnt offering from the beeves (<a href="/context/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>), and burnt offering from the flock (<a href="/context/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10-13</a>). The ox takes precedence because it is the more costly and more important sacrifice. It had to be without disease or blemish of any kind. To offer a defective sacrifice was an insult and a deception. Hence the exclamation of the prophet, "cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>an animal with a blemish), <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm" title="But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, said the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.">Malachi 1:14</a>. The offerer is to bring the animal to <span class= "ital">the entrance of the tent of meeting, </span>as it should be rendered, that is, to the front of the Tabernacle where the brazen altar stood (<a href="/exodus/40-6.htm" title="And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.">Exodus 40:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Of his own voluntary will.</span>--The whole passage is better rendered, <span class= "ital">at the entrance of the tent of meeting shall he offer it, that he may be accepted before the Lord. </span>(Comp. <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-5.htm" title="And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it at your own will.">Leviticus 19:5</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/22-19.htm" title="You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.">Leviticus 22:19-20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-29.htm" title="And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.">Leviticus 22:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a>.) This meaning is unmistakably set forth in <a href="/context/leviticus/22-19.htm" title="You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.">Leviticus 22:19-21</a>, where it is explicitly declared, "ye shall offer for your acceptance a male without blemish of the beeves, of the sheep or of the goats, but whatsoever hath a blemish that ye shall not offer, for <span class= "ital">it </span>shall not be acceptable for you." It is to be remarked that the phrase "for your acceptance," or "acceptable for you," is only used in connection with burnt offerings and peace offerings, but never with sin offerings. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If his offering be a burnt sacrifice.</span> The Hebrew term for "burnt sacrifice" is <span class="accented">olah</span>, meaning "that which ascends;" sometimes <span class="accented">kaleel</span> "whole offering," is found (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>); the LXX. use the word <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "whole burnt offering."
