In biblical terms, God's "face" represents His presence and favor. When God sets His face against someone, it signifies His disfavor and judgment. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>, where God sets His face against Jerusalem for harm. The idea of God turning His face away is also seen in the Aaronic blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the opposite is desired&#8212;God's face shining upon His people, indicating blessing and peace.<p><b>so that you will be defeated by your enemies</b><br>This consequence is a direct result of God's disfavor. In the historical context of Israel, military defeat was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure. The Israelites' victories and defeats were closely tied to their covenant relationship with God. When they were obedient, God promised to fight for them, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>. Conversely, disobedience led to defeat, as illustrated in the battles during the period of the Judges, where Israel repeatedly fell into the hands of their enemies due to their unfaithfulness.<p><b>Those who hate you will rule over you</b><br>This phrase highlights the reversal of the intended order where Israel, as God's chosen people, was meant to be the head and not the tail (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>). The rule of enemies over Israel is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly during the times of the Judges and the Babylonian exile. This domination by enemies serves as a tangible expression of the curses for disobedience outlined in the covenant. It also foreshadows the ultimate need for a deliverer, pointing to the messianic hope fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who brings ultimate liberation from spiritual bondage.<p><b>and you will flee when no one pursues you</b><br>This phrase describes a state of fear and paranoia resulting from a guilty conscience and the absence of God's peace. It reflects the psychological and spiritual turmoil that accompanies disobedience. The imagery of fleeing without a pursuer is also found in <a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>, where the wicked flee though no one pursues, contrasting with the boldness of the righteous. This condition underscores the internal consequences of sin, where fear replaces the security that comes from trusting in God. It serves as a reminder of the peace and assurance available through faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His response to Israel's disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's covenant and the ones being warned of the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who will defeat and rule over the Israelites as a result of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_at_sinai.htm">Covenant at Sinai</a></b><br>The broader context of Leviticus, where God establishes His covenant with Israel, including blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land given to the Israelites, where these blessings and curses would manifest based on their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's warning in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> underscores the seriousness of turning away from His commands. Disobedience leads to tangible consequences, including defeat and oppression.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>This verse highlights God's sovereign control over nations and His just nature. He allows consequences to unfold as a means of correction and to uphold His covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>While the verse speaks of judgment, it also implicitly calls for repentance. The broader biblical account shows that turning back to God can restore His favor.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare_and_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Warfare and Vigilance</a></b><br>The idea of fleeing when no one pursues can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual unrest and fear that comes from being out of alignment with God. Staying vigilant in faith can prevent unnecessary fear and anxiety.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_leadership.htm">Community and Leadership</a></b><br>The verse serves as a reminder of the impact of collective disobedience.
