In the ancient Near Eastern context, water creatures were abundant and varied, making it necessary to establish clear guidelines. The Israelites, living near bodies of water like the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, would have encountered a wide range of aquatic life. This command reflects God's concern for the health and holiness of His people, setting them apart from surrounding nations with different dietary practices.<p><b>whether in the seas or in the streams</b><br>This specifies the habitats of the creatures, encompassing both saltwater and freshwater environments. The distinction between seas and streams indicates a comprehensive scope, covering all possible sources of water. This inclusivity ensures that the Israelites understand the universality of the law, applying it to all bodies of water they might encounter. The mention of both environments highlights the thoroughness of God's instructions, ensuring no ambiguity in the application of the law.<p><b>you may eat anything with fins and scales</b><br>This criterion for permissible aquatic creatures is both practical and symbolic. Fins and scales are features that typically belong to fish, which are generally considered clean and safe to eat. The requirement for fins and scales serves as a simple, observable guideline for distinguishing clean from unclean creatures. Symbolically, fins and scales can represent spiritual protection and guidance, as they enable fish to navigate and survive in their environment. This law foreshadows the New Testament teaching of discernment and purity, as seen in passages like <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, where Peter's vision expands the understanding of clean and unclean, ultimately pointing to the inclusivity of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the dietary laws were given as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the Law, including dietary instructions, during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>The dietary laws were given to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.

The verse reassures believers that the Creator who filled the waters also cares enough to guide daily choices, calling His people to enjoy His provision while walking in obedient separation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">These shall ye eat.</span>--The water animals, which, as we have seen, constitute the second division of the animal kingdom, now follow the land animals. They are discussed in <a href="/context/leviticus/11-9.htm" title="These shall you eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall you eat.">Leviticus 11:9-12</a>. Like the clean quadrupeds, the salt-water and the fresh-water fish must comply with two conditions to bring them within the class of clean. They must have both scales and fins. It will be seen that in the case of the quadrupeds, not only are two criteria given by which the clean animals may be distinguished from the unclean, but that the law is illustrated by adducing ten land animals of the former kind (see <a href="/leviticus/11-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which you shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.">Leviticus 11:2</a>), and four of the latter (see <a href="/context/leviticus/11-4.htm" title="Nevertheless these shall you not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he is unclean to you.">Leviticus 11:4-7</a>). In the case before us, however, not a single typical fish is given by name, and the law itself is expressed in the briefest and most generic manner possible. It was evidently left to those upon whom the administration of the law devolved to define it more minutely in order that it may be observed in practical life. Hence the following expanded definitions obtained during the second Temple:--(1) All fishes with scales have invariably also fins, but fishes which have fins have not always scales. Any fish, therefore, or even a piece of one exposed by itself for sale in the market, which exhibits scales may be eaten, for it is to be taken for granted that it had fins, or that the fins cannot be seen because of their extraordinary smallness. But, on the other hand, a fish with fins may exist without scales, and hence is unclean; (2) Clean fishes have a complete vertebral column, but the unclean have simply single joints, united by a gelatinous cord. To the former class belong, (<span class= "ital">a</span>) "the soft fins," or the salmon and trout, the capellan and grayling, the herring, the anchovy and the sardine, the pike and carp families, the cod, the hake and the haddock, the sole, the turbot, and the plaice; (b) "the spiny fins," as the perch, the mackerel, and the tunny. To the latter class belong the shark tribe, the sturgeons with their caviare, the lamprey, and the nine-eyed eel; (3) The head of clean fishes is more or less broad, whilst that of the unclean kinds is more or less pointed at the end, as the eel, the mammalian species, &c.; (4) The swimming bladder of clean fishes is rounded at one end, and pointed at the other, whilst that of the unclean fishes is either rounded or pointed at both extremities alike. It is in allusion to this law that we are told in the parable of the fisherman, which is taken from Jewish life, that when they drew to shore the net with every kind of fishes, the fishermen sat down (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to examine the clean and the unclean), and gathered the good (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the clean), into the vessels, but cast the bad (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the unclean) away (<a href="/matthew/13-48.htm" title="Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.">Matthew 13:48</a>). The orthodox Jews to this day strictly observe these regulations, and abhor eating those fishes which are enumerated under the four above-named criteria of not clean. It is moreover to be remarked that fishes without scales are also still regarded in Egypt as unwholesome, and that the Romans would not permit them to be offered in sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever hath fins and scales.</span> The absence of fins and scales, or their apparent absence - for phenomenal language is used, as before - gives to fish a repulsive look, on which is grounded the prohibition to eat them. Eels and shell-fish are thus forbidden, though a long course of experience has now taken away the feeling of repulsion with which they were once looked upon. The flesh of the beasts for, bidden to be eaten is only described as unclean, but that of the prohibited fish, birds, insects, and vermin, is designated as <span class="cmt_word">an abomination unto you</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Of all [the creatures]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
