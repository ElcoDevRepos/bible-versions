The covenant with Jacob, also known as Israel, is a continuation of the Abrahamic covenant, which includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing. Jacob's life, marked by struggles and transformation, reflects the ongoing relationship between God and His people. The covenant is unconditional, highlighting God's grace and commitment despite Israel's disobedience. This remembrance signifies a future restoration and blessing for Israel, aligning with prophecies of national restoration found in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>.<p><b>and My covenant with Isaac</b><br>Isaac, the son of Abraham, represents the continuation of God's covenantal promises. The covenant with Isaac reaffirms the promises made to Abraham, including the inheritance of the land of Canaan and the establishment of a chosen people. Isaac's life, characterized by faith and obedience, serves as a type of Christ, particularly in the account of the near-sacrifice on Mount Moriah, which prefigures Christ's sacrificial death. The mention of Isaac underscores the generational aspect of God's promises and His unwavering commitment to fulfill them.<p><b>and My covenant with Abraham</b><br>The covenant with Abraham is foundational to the biblical narrative, establishing the framework for God's redemptive plan. It includes promises of a great nation, blessings, and a land for his descendants. Abraham's faith and obedience are central themes, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15 and 17</a>, where God makes and reaffirms His covenant. This covenant is pivotal in understanding the relationship between God and Israel and is often referenced throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament, where it is seen as a precursor to the new covenant in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<p><b>and I will remember the land</b><br>The land is a critical component of the covenant, symbolizing God's promise and faithfulness. It is not just a physical territory but a place of divine blessing and presence. The land of Canaan, promised to Abraham and his descendants, is central to Israel's identity and history. This phrase indicates God's intention to restore Israel to their land, a theme echoed in prophetic books like Jeremiah and Isaiah. The land also serves as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the new heavens and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, Jacob is a patriarch of Israel whose name was changed to Israel.

The expression "remember" frequently denotes "to be mindful," "to perform," especially when used with regard to God; as, for instance, "I have remembered my covenant," &c. (<a href="/context/exodus/6-5.htm" title="And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.">Exodus 6:5-6</a>); "He remembered for them his covenant" (<a href="/psalms/106-45.htm" title="And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.">Psalm 106:45</a>).<p><span class= "bld">My covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham.</span>--When thus brought to repentance, the Lord will perform towards them the covenant which He made with their ancestors, and in which He not only promised that the Israelites are to be a numerous people, but that they are to possess the land for ever (<a href="/exodus/32-13.htm" title="Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.">Exodus 32:13</a>). From the fact that the expression "covenant" is here exceptionally repeated before the name of each patriarch, the authorities during the second Temple rightly concluded that it refers to three distinct covenants made respectively with the patriarchs. Hence the Chaldee Versions render it, "And I will remember in mercy the covenant which I covenanted with Jacob at Bethel [<a href="/context/genesis/35-9.htm" title="And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.">Genesis 35:9-15</a>], and also the covenant which I covenanted with Isaac at Mount Moriah [Genesis 22], and the covenant which I covenanted with Abraham between the divided pieces [of the sacrifices (<a href="/context/genesis/15-18.htm" title="In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:">Genesis 15:18-21</a>)]." The ancients also call attention to the fact that whilst in all other passages where the three patriarchs are mentioned together, the order is according to their seniority, viz., Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>;
