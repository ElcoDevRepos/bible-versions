In the ancient Near Eastern context, animals with split hooves were often seen as suitable for domestication and consumption. The split hoof is a physical characteristic that, in other clean animals, symbolizes separation and purity. However, the pig's failure to meet the second criterion (chewing the cud) renders it unclean. This distinction emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's specific instructions rather than relying on partial compliance.<p><b>does not chew the cud;</b><br>Chewing the cud is a process where animals regurgitate their food and chew it again, which is a characteristic of ruminant animals. This process was seen as a sign of cleanliness and purity in the dietary laws given to Israel. The act of chewing the cud can symbolize meditation and reflection on God's Word, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous person meditates on the law day and night. The pig's failure to chew the cud signifies a lack of this meditative process, making it unclean according to the Levitical law.<p><b>it is unclean for you.</b><br>The declaration of the pig as unclean is part of the broader Levitical dietary laws that set Israel apart from other nations. These laws served to maintain the holiness and distinctiveness of God's people. The term "unclean" in this context means that the animal is not suitable for consumption or sacrifice. This separation from unclean animals is a physical representation of the spiritual separation from sin and impurity. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ fulfills the law, and the ceremonial aspects, including dietary restrictions, are no longer binding (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>, <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>).

Pigs were plentiful in the ancient Near East, yet Israel was told to keep their distance. Other prophets later mention them to illustrate rebellion (<a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>; 66:3, 17). Jesus&#8217; parable of the prodigal son even pictures a Jewish boy feeding pigs to highlight the depth of his fall (<a href="/luke/15-15.htm">Luke 15:15-16</a>). From the start, then, the Lord singles out a creature that would forever remind His people of the boundary between holy and common life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though it has a split hoof completely divided</b><p>On first glance the pig seems to meet the obvious qualification for clean land animals&#8212;its hoof is split right through (<a href="/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-6.htm">Deuteronomy 14:6</a>). The outward sign looks right. This detail quietly teaches that appearances alone never guarantee acceptability to God. As Samuel later heard, &#8220;man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>Helpful takeaway:<p>&#8226; Discernment must move beyond what is immediately visible.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s definitions, not cultural convenience, set the standard for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>does not chew the cud</b><p>Here is the disqualifying trait.

The label set clear limits on Israel&#8217;s diet and associations (<a href="/leviticus/11-46.htm">Leviticus 11:46-47</a>). Keeping such distinctions trained the nation to prize holiness in every sphere (<a href="/leviticus/20-25.htm">Leviticus 20:25-26</a>).<p>New-covenant light:<p>&#8226; Jesus declared, &#8220;Whatever enters a man from the outside cannot defile him&#8230; Thus He declared all foods clean&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter learned the same lesson through the rooftop vision of unclean animals (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>). Still, Peter&#8217;s first reaction&#8212;&#8220;Surely not, Lord!&#8221;&#8212;shows how deeply Leviticus had shaped him.<p>&#8226; While Christ fulfilled the dietary laws (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>), their moral principle endures: God&#8217;s people are to remain distinct, letting Him define purity (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a> uses the pig to illustrate that outward conformity without corresponding inner reality falls short of God&#8217;s holiness. The split hoof suggests suitability, but the absence of cud-chewing cancels the claim, leaving the animal &#8220;unclean.&#8221; Israel&#8217;s food laws taught discernment, obedience, and a life set apart&#8212;lessons still relevant today, even though Christ has released believers from the regulations themselves. God&#8217;s people continue to learn from the pig that true holiness is both visible and internal, shaped wholly by the Lord&#8217;s revealed standards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And the swine, though he is clovenfooted, and entirely separateth the hoofs. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/11-3.htm" title="Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven footed, and chews the cud, among the beasts, that shall you eat.">Leviticus 11:3</a>.) Having given these illustrations of animals which comply with the first condition only--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>which are ruminant but not bisulcous--and hence must not be eaten, the lawgiver now concludes the list of prohibited quadrupeds with an illustration of a contrary nature--viz., the swine, which comply with the second condition only, but not with the first. Here, too, the description is according to appearance. The feet of the pig tribe generally have four toes enclosed in separate hoofs. The two middle hoofs, however, are much larger, and are divided by a deep cleft, and hence to all appearances the swine is bisulcous. Though the law before us simply describes the swine as wanting in one of the two criteria, like the camel, the coney, and the hare, yet the abhorrence which the Jews, as a nation, have always had of this animal, and the impurity which they have ascribed to it infinitely surpass their repulsion of any other unclean beast. For this reason it became the symbol of defilement and the badge of insult (<a href="/psalms/65-4.htm" title="Blessed is the man whom you choose, and cause to approach to you, that he may dwell in your courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, even of your holy temple.">Psalm 65:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-3.htm" title="Say to God, How terrible are you in your works! through the greatness of your power shall your enemies submit themselves to you.">Psalm 66:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-17.htm" title="I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.">Psalm 66:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-22.htm" title="As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.">Proverbs 11:22</a>). The eating of pork was regarded as renouncing the Law, and as a sign of apostasy. Hence Antiochus Epiphanes adopted it as a test that those Jews who ate it had forsaken their religion and submitted to his rule. Hence we read that when swine's flesh was forced into the mouth of Eleazar, the aged scribe, he "spit it forth, choosing rather to die gloriously than to live stained with such an abomination<span class= "ital">" </span>(<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-18.htm" title="Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine's flesh.">2 Maccabees 6:18-19</a>). During the time of the commonwealth there were no swine in Judea. Hence it was in a "far country" that the prodigal son was sent into the field to feed the swine (<a href="/context/luke/15-13.htm" title="And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.">Luke 15:13-15</a>). The swine in Galilee in our Lord's time (<a href="/matthew/8-30.htm" title="And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.">Matthew 8:30</a>) were undoubtedly kept by Gentiles for the Roman legion. The very name of swine (<span class= "ital">chazir</span>) was discarded, and the animal was designated by the euphemistic expression, "the other thing." This "brutish of all animals" was, moreover, regarded as propagating cutaneous and many other disorders. The Talmud declares that "ten measures of pestilential diseases were spread over the earth, and nine of them fell to the share of pigs." On the other hand, many of the Pagan nations regarded the swine as an emblem of the productive power of nature. Hence they sacrificed them to those deities to whom they ascribed the fertility of the soil, and the fruitfulness of cattle. Thus, the Egyptians offered them in honour of Isis and Osiris once a year at the festival of the full moon. The Athenians, too, offered the swine in their mysteries; so did the Boetians and the early Romans. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted.</span> Here, again, the description is not according to anatomical analysis, but to ordinary appearance. The pig appears to be cloven-footed, and it would be misleading to give any other account of his foot in ordinary speech, but scientifically speaking, he has four toes. The prohibition of the use of swine's flesh does not arise from the fear of trichinosis or other disease, but from the disgust caused by the carnivorous and filthy habits of the Eastern pig. The repulsion originally felt for swine's flesh was natural, and, where the animal is carnivorous, is still natural, but where its habits are changed, and it has become simply graminivorous, the feeling has ceased to exist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
