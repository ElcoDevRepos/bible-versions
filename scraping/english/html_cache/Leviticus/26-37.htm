In the context of <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, this is part of the curses for disobedience to God's covenant. The imagery of stumbling suggests a lack of stability and direction, often associated with fear and chaos. This can be compared to the Israelites' experiences in the wilderness, where disobedience led to wandering and confusion (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33</a>). Theologically, it reflects the consequences of turning away from God's guidance, leading to internal strife and disorder.<p><b>as before the sword</b><br>The mention of the sword symbolizes imminent danger and warfare. Historically, Israel faced numerous threats from surrounding nations, and the sword often represented divine judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). The fear of the sword without an actual enemy present underscores the psychological terror and the perception of threat due to a guilty conscience. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where disobedience would lead to being defeated before enemies.<p><b>though no one is behind them</b><br>This phrase highlights the irrational fear and paranoia that can grip a people who have lost their trust in God. It suggests a supernatural fear, where the threat is not physical but spiritual and psychological. This can be related to the concept of a guilty conscience, where fear is magnified by the awareness of sin and separation from God (<a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>). Theologically, it points to the absence of God's protection, leading to fear even when no real threat exists.<p><b>So you will not be able to stand against your enemies</b><br>This consequence is a direct result of breaking the covenant with God. In the historical context, Israel's strength and success were contingent upon their faithfulness to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). The inability to stand against enemies signifies a loss of divine favor and protection. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel's victories and defeats are tied to their spiritual state (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14-15</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate need for a savior, as human strength and righteousness are insufficient without God's intervention, pointing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, the Israelites are God's chosen people, receiving the laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered God's laws to the Israelites, including the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land where the Israelites were headed, a place of blessing if they obeyed God, but also a place of potential judgment if they disobeyed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The surrounding nations that could become a threat to Israel if they failed to follow God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority and lawgiver, who promises blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God leads to fear and instability, symbolized by stumbling even when not pursued.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is crucial for spiritual stability and protection from enemies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_faith.htm">Fear and Faith</a></b><br>A lack of faith results in fear and confusion, while trust in God brings peace and confidence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The actions of individuals can affect the entire community, as seen in the collective consequences faced by Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Spiritual battles require reliance on God; without Him, we are vulnerable to defeat.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_26_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 26:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_26_37_Disobedience_effects.htm">How does Leviticus 26:37 illustrate consequences of disobedience to God's commands?

Similar scenes appear in <a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21-22</a>, where Midianite soldiers &#8220;ran, crying out as they fled,&#8221; and in <a href="/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3-4</a>, where judgment leaves people &#8220;crushed beneath the prisoners.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This stumbling is not accidental; it is God-ordained turmoil, echoing <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, &#8220;you will flee when no one pursues you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The loss of composure reminds us that sin destabilizes life. <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a> says, &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.&#8221; When fellowship with God is broken, inner confidence evaporates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as before the sword, though no one is behind them</b><p>&#8226; God threatens a terrifying illusion: they will act as if a sword were at their backs even while the path is empty. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a> portrays the same dread&#8212;&#8220;you will find no resting place&#8230;you will live in suspense, filled with dread.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such fear demonstrates that judgment can strike inside the heart before any physical enemy appears. In <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6-7</a>, the Arameans abandoned their camp because &#8220;the Lord had caused them to hear the sound of chariots,&#8221; showing how God can weaponize fear itself.<p>&#8226; The phrase also underscores divine sovereignty: the Lord does not need human armies to humble a rebellious people; He can turn their own thoughts into weapons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So you will not be able to stand against your enemies</b><p>&#8226; Here is the outcome: paralyzing fear leads to defeat. <a href="/joshua/7-12.htm">Joshua 7:12</a> states it plainly: &#8220;You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove the things devoted to destruction.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God had promised victory for obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-7.htm">Leviticus 26:7-8</a>), but disobedience reverses the blessing. The contrast highlights covenant faithfulness as the hinge of Israel&#8217;s security.<p>&#8226; This principle threads through Scripture&#8212;<a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10-11</a> shows Israel routed when treating God lightly, while <a href="/psalms/44-9.htm">Psalm 44:9-10</a> laments, &#8220;You make us retreat before the enemy.&#8221; Sin strips away the protective presence of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/26-37.htm">Leviticus 26:37</a> warns that unchecked disobedience produces inner collapse before outer defeat ever arrives. God pictures His people tripping over each other, terrified by imaginary swords, unable to face real foes. The verse underlines a timeless truth: when relationship with God is fractured, courage, clarity, and victory evaporate, but when He is honored, His people stand firm.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/26-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will stumble</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
