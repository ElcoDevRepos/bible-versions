As members of the priestly family, they held significant roles in the religious life of Israel. Their lineage is important as it highlights the gravity of their actions, given their close proximity to the divine instructions delivered through Moses. Their actions serve as a cautionary tale about the responsibilities and expectations placed upon those in spiritual leadership.<p><b>took their censers</b><br>Censers were vessels used to hold burning coals and incense, integral to the priestly duties in the tabernacle. The use of censers was a sacred act, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God. The fact that Nadab and Abihu took their censers indicates they were performing a priestly function, but their approach was flawed, highlighting the importance of adhering to divine instructions in worship.<p><b>put fire in them and added incense</b><br>The act of putting fire and incense in the censers was part of the ritualistic duties of the priests. However, the source of the fire was crucial. According to Levitical law, the fire for incense was to be taken from the altar of burnt offering, which was kindled by God Himself (<a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>). This detail underscores the necessity of following God's specific instructions in worship practices.<p><b>and offered unauthorized fire before the LORD</b><br>The term "unauthorized fire" indicates that Nadab and Abihu used fire that was not sanctioned by God. This act of disobedience was a direct violation of the divine command and demonstrated a lack of reverence for God's holiness. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience and the consequences of deviating from God's prescribed ways.<p><b>contrary to His command</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the disobedience of Nadab and Abihu. God's commands regarding worship were clear and specific, and any deviation was considered a serious offense. This incident foreshadows the New Testament teaching that true worship must be conducted "in spirit and truth" (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). It also points to the necessity of Christ's perfect obedience, as He fulfilled the law and provided the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab_and_abihu.htm">Nadab and Abihu</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron, the first High Priest of Israel.

(See <a href="/context/leviticus/2-2.htm" title="And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:">Leviticus 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/2-16.htm" title="And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 2:16</a>, &c.) The case of Korah and his company was an exception, since it was ordered by Moses for an especial purpose (<a href="/context/numbers/16-6.htm" title="This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;">Numbers 16:6-25</a>). (4) They offered the incense at an unauthorised time, since it was apart from the morning and evening sacrifice. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nadab and Ahibu are said to have each taken his censer.</span> This is the first time that the word used in the original is translated "censer." It means any vessel or pan that will hold embers or tinder (see <a href="/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>; <a href="/exodus/37-23.htm">Exodus 37:23</a>; <a href="/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They put fire therein, and put incense thereon.</span> No doubt they used the incense ordered in <a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34</a>. They are not found fault with for the incense, but for the fire that they used. <span class="cmt_word">They offered strange fire</span>, that is, fire not taken from the altar of burnt offering, which they might have feared to approach after the miracle that had occurred. In chapter Leviticus 16:12 it is ordered that, on the Day of Atonement, the incense fire should be taken from the brazen altar, and this was no doubt the rule on all occasions, though the law has not been recorded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Aaron&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1440;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_175.htm">Strong's 175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aaron -- an elder brother of Moses</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nadab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5070.htm">Strong's 5070: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nadab -- an Israelite name</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Abihu</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
