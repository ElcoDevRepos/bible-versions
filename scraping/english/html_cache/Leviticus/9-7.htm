Aaron, his brother, is the high priest, a role that requires him to perform sacred duties. This moment marks the beginning of Aaron's priestly ministry, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's instructions.<p><b>Approach the altar</b><br>The altar is central to the sacrificial system, symbolizing the place where God meets with His people. Approaching the altar signifies entering into God's presence, a privilege and responsibility for the priest. This act foreshadows the ultimate approach to God through Jesus Christ, our High Priest.<p><b>and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering</b><br>The sin offering is for atonement of specific sins, while the burnt offering represents total dedication to God. These offerings underscore the need for purification and consecration before God. They point to Christ's sacrifice, which fulfills and surpasses these offerings by providing complete atonement and sanctification.<p><b>to make atonement for yourself and for the people</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation with God, achieved through the shedding of blood. Aaron must first be cleansed before interceding for the people, illustrating the necessity of holiness in those who serve God. This prefigures Christ, who, though sinless, made atonement for humanity.<p><b>And sacrifice the people&#8217;s offering</b><br>The people's offering includes various sacrifices that express worship, thanksgiving, and atonement. This communal aspect emphasizes the collective responsibility of the Israelites to maintain their covenant relationship with God. It reflects the communal nature of the Church, united in Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>to make atonement for them</b><br>The repeated emphasis on atonement highlights its centrality in the relationship between God and His people. It underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for divine forgiveness. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.<p><b>as the LORD has commanded</b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial for the Israelites, reflecting their covenant commitment. This obedience is not merely ritualistic but is meant to cultivate a heart aligned with God's will.

Hence, whilst their share of the sin is to be atoned by a special sacrifice (see <a href="/leviticus/9-15.htm" title="And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.">Leviticus 9:15</a>), they are yet to participate in the atoning virtue of Aaron's sacrifice because they prevailed on him to make the calf (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm" title="And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.">Exodus 32:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make an atonement for thyself, and for the people.</span> By means of the sin offering for the high priest, whose sin brought guilt both on himself and upon the people (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>).
