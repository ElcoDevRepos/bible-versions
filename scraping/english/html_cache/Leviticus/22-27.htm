Oxen, sheep, and goats were domesticated animals integral to the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites. These animals were considered clean according to Levitical law and were often used in various offerings and sacrifices. The choice of these animals underscores their value and significance in the community, both economically and religiously.<p><b>it must remain with its mother for seven days</b><br>The requirement for the newborn animal to stay with its mother for seven days reflects a period of completeness and wholeness, as the number seven often symbolizes in the Bible. This time allows the animal to gain strength and ensures it is viable. The seven-day period also mirrors the creation week, suggesting a divine order and completeness in the natural world. This practice may have also had practical implications, ensuring the animal's health and survival before being considered for sacrifice.<p><b>From the eighth day on</b><br>The eighth day marks a new beginning, a theme consistent throughout Scripture. The number eight often signifies a new order or creation, as seen in the practice of circumcision on the eighth day (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>). This transition from the seventh to the eighth day indicates readiness and acceptability before God, symbolizing a move from natural to spiritual service.<p><b>it will be acceptable as a food offering</b><br>The term "acceptable" indicates that the offering meets the standards set by God for worship. The food offering, or "korban," was a way for the Israelites to express devotion, thanksgiving, and atonement. This acceptability underscores the importance of following divine instructions precisely, reflecting the holiness and purity required in worship.<p><b>presented to the LORD</b><br>The act of presenting the offering to the LORD signifies the dedication and consecration of the sacrifice to God. It emphasizes the relationship between the Israelites and their God, where offerings were a means of maintaining covenantal fellowship. This presentation is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often typified as the Lamb of God, offered once for all (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).

These clean animals (<a href="/leviticus/11-1.htm">Leviticus 11:1&#8211;3</a>) were already singled out in <a href="/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a> &#8211; 3 as fitting for burnt offerings. By repeating them here, God narrows the focus to everyday herd life, showing that worship is woven into ordinary agriculture. <a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a> reminds Israel that where God&#8217;s name is honored, He &#8220;will come to you and bless you,&#8221; tying barnyard births directly to divine fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it must remain with its mother for seven days</b><p>For one full, God-ordained week the newborn is left untouched. That pause teaches:<p>&#8226; Compassionate stewardship. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6-7</a> guards mother birds; <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> forbids seething a kid in its mother&#8217;s milk. The pattern underscores <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, &#8220;A righteous man regards the life of his animal.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The principle of completeness. Seven days complete the created order (<a href="/genesis/2-1.htm">Genesis 2:1-3</a>). The animal&#8217;s first week mirrors that rhythm, declaring that life is God&#8217;s gift before it becomes an offering.<p>&#8226; Protection of the weak. A nursing period ensures the young gain strength, reflecting God&#8217;s care for the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/147-9.htm">Psalm 147:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the eighth day on</b><p>Day eight signals readiness. Circumcision occurs on the eighth day (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/12-3.htm">Leviticus 12:3</a>), and the priestly consecration culminates on an eighth-day ceremony (<a href="/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>). In Scripture, eight often marks new beginnings&#8212;life beyond the first complete cycle. After one full week the animal steps from dependence into suitability for holy service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the LORD</b><p>&#8220;Acceptable&#8221; points to divine standards, not human preference (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>; 22:20). The life belongs to God, and only at His appointed time may it become &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>). The instruction balances two truths:<p>&#8226; God claims first rights (<a href="/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>) yet never at the expense of humane treatment.<p>&#8226; Worship must align with God&#8217;s revealed order; good intentions cannot override His commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/22-27.htm">Leviticus 22:27</a> teaches that every detail of life&#8212;even the timing of an animal&#8217;s weaning&#8212;falls under God&#8217;s loving authority. By requiring a seven-day waiting period and opening acceptance on the eighth, the Lord protects the helpless, honors the rhythm of creation, and sets firm boundaries for acceptable worship. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to treat His creatures with kindness and to bring offerings only in the way and at the time He prescribes, assuring that mercy and obedience walk hand in hand before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat--</span>The three sacrificial quadrupeds.

For the same reason children could not be circumcised before the eighth day from their birth. (See <a href="/exodus/22-29.htm" title="You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits, and of your liquors: the firstborn of your sons shall you give to me.">Exodus 22:29</a>.)
