The Israelites were instructed to bring their offerings to the tabernacle, emphasizing the centralization of worship and the importance of following God's ordained methods. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commands and the rejection of syncretism.<p><b>to the goat demons</b><br>The term "goat demons" refers to pagan deities or spirits that were believed to inhabit the wilderness. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, these entities were often associated with fertility and chaos. The Israelites were warned against engaging in idolatrous practices that were common among surrounding nations. This highlights the biblical theme of spiritual purity and the rejection of idolatry, as seen in the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p><b>to which they have prostituted themselves</b><br>The use of the term "prostituted" metaphorically describes Israel's unfaithfulness to God through idolatry. This language is consistent with prophetic literature, such as Hosea, where idolatry is likened to adultery. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where idolatry is seen as a breach of faithfulness.<p><b>This will be a permanent statute for them</b><br>The phrase indicates the enduring nature of this command. It was not a temporary measure but a lasting ordinance meant to guide the Israelites in their worship practices. This reflects the unchanging nature of God's standards and the importance of maintaining holiness and purity in worship.<p><b>for the generations to come</b><br>This emphasizes the transgenerational aspect of God's commandments. The instruction was not only for the immediate audience but for all future descendants.

Not only was there a celebrated temple in Thmuis, the capital of the Mendesian Nomos in Lower Egypt, dedicated to the goat-image Pan, whom they called Mendes, and worshipped as the oracle, and as the fertilising principle in nature, but they erected statues of him everywhere. Hence the Pan, Silenus, satyrs, fauns, and the woodland gods among the Greeks and Romans; and hence, too, the goat-like form of the devil, with a tail, horns, and cloven feet, which obtain in medieval Christianity, and which may still be seen in some European cities. The terror which the devil, appearing in this Pan-like form, created among those who were thought to have seen him, has given rise to our expression <span class= "ital">panic. </span>This is the form of idolatrous worship which the Jews brought with them from Egypt, and to which reference is continually made. (See <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-7.htm" title="Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-3.htm" title="And they committed prostitutions in Egypt; they committed prostitutions in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.">Ezekiel 23:3</a>, &c.; and especially <a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm" title="And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.">2Chronicles 11:15</a>.) The expression "and they shall <span class= "ital">no more </span>offer" shows that the Israelites were hitherto in the habit of first dedicating their ordinary food to these deities; whilst the words "gone a whoring" indicate the orgies connected with this form of idol worship, It has been urged that the demand to offer up, in so confined a space as the entrance of <span class= "ital">the </span>sanctuary, the domestic animals intended for the daily consumption of more than 600,000 people, imposed a task upon the people which it was impossible for them to carry out. Hence it has been urged that the injunction here (<a href="/context/leviticus/17-2.htm" title="Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them; This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,">Leviticus 17:2-7</a>) must refer to sacrifices. But this difficulty arises from importing our modern notions into the ancient mode of living. The ancient Israelites, like the modem Orientals, especially the nomadic tribes, ate very little flesh meat apart from the seasons of sacrifice, which were the occasions of feasting. Besides, those who urge this difficulty ignore the fact that the injunction before us is restricted to the three kinds of animals; that none of the wild clean quadrupeds, as stags, roes, &c, nor any of the feathered tribes, as pigeons, turtle doves, &c, which formed an essential part of the daily diet, is here included; and that even the three kinds of sacrificial quadrupeds only come within this restriction when they are qualified by age, which was within two years, and by physical condition, which demanded that it should have no external defect, as blindness of one eye, lameness of one foot, &c., to be offered first to the Lord. Moreover, the injunction was only intended to operate temporarily, whilst the Jews sojourned and wandered about in the wilderness, where, besides the propensity to sacrifice these animals to idols, they would have been in danger of extirpating their most useful animals. The law was repealed when the Israelites entered the promised land. (Comp. <a href="/context/deuteronomy/12-13.htm" title="Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:">Deuteronomy 12:13-15</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring.</span> The word rightly translated <span class="accented">devils</span> means, literally, shaggy goats (see <a href="/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; where the word occurs). It is generally supposed that the Israelites borrowed their worship of the goat-like spirits of the woods and fields from Egypt. That goat-worship prevailed there in a very foul shape we know (Herod., 2:42), but sacrifices in the open fields are rather a Persian habit (Herod., 1:132). Pan-worship, however, was common to most if not to all agricultural nations. The injunction which follows, This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations, which cannot be confined to the last few words or verses, shows that the command of verse 3 refers to sacrifices, not to ordinary slaughtering. Had slaughtering been meant, the statute could not have been intended to be more than temporary in its obligation. The importance attributed to the regulation is further shown by the declaration previously made, that whoever transgressed it should be <span class="accented">cut off from among his people</span>, or excommunicated. In fact, it makes an era in the history of the chosen people. The old patriarchal priesthood having ceased, and the Aaronic priesthood substituted for it, the tabernacle is appointed to serve as a religious centre to the race. Whenever, from this time onwards, sacrifices were offered, without offense, elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle or temple, as by Samuel (see <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>), and by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-32.htm">1 Kings 18:32</a>), it was done by the direct order or dispensation of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/17-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They must no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
