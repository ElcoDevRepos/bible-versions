The prohibition against incest is rooted in the need to maintain family purity and social order. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such relationships were often taboo, though not universally prohibited. The command reflects God's desire for His people to be distinct from surrounding nations, many of which practiced various forms of sexual immorality. This law underscores the sanctity of family relationships and the importance of boundaries within them.<p><b>either your father&#8217;s daughter or your mother&#8217;s daughter</b><br>This phrase clarifies that the prohibition applies regardless of whether the sister is a full or half-sibling. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, family lineage and inheritance were significant, and this law helped prevent complications that could arise from incestuous relationships. The distinction between paternal and maternal siblings ensures that the law covers all possible familial connections, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of God's commandments.<p><b>whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere</b><br>This clause extends the prohibition to sisters who may not have been raised in the same household, possibly due to polygamous marriages or other family arrangements common in ancient times. It highlights the universality of the command, ensuring that no loopholes exist based on living arrangements. This reflects the broader biblical principle that God's laws are applicable in all circumstances, not just those that are immediately apparent or convenient.<br><br>Connections to other scripture include the broader biblical theme of sexual purity, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>, which calls believers to flee from sexual immorality.

Hence we find Abraham, the father of the faithful, married his half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm" title="And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.">Genesis 20:12</a>). The same practice obtained amongst other nations of antiquity. Thus the Athenians married their half-sisters by their father's side, and the Spartans married half-sisters by the same mother, whilst the Assyrians and Egyptians married full sisters. Though nothing can be more explicit than the law here laid down, and though the transgression of it is denounced as an accursed and impious crime, to be visited with capital punishment (see <a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm" title="And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he has uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-22.htm" title="Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>), yet from the narrative of Amnon and his sister Tamar, and especially from the touching and melancholy remark of the outraged sister (<a href="/2_samuel/13-13.htm" title="And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.">2Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-16.htm" title="And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.">2Samuel 13:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm" title="And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.">2Samuel 13:20</a>), it is evident that the practice of the primitive parents of the human race and the example of the father of the Hebrew nation, continued to be followed in spite of this law. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm" title="And one has committed abomination with his neighbor's wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father's daughter.">Ezekiel 22:11</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - In the third place, incest with a sister is forbidden, and it is specifically stated that under the term "sister" is meant the half-sister, the <span class="cmt_word">daughter of thy father, or... thy mother,... born at home</span>, as would naturally be the case if she were the father's daughter, or born abroad, that is, the daughter of the mother by a previous marriage, when she belonged to a different household. Tamar's appeal to Amnon, "I pray thee speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee," exhibits to us the poor woman grasping at any argument which might save her from her half-brother's brutality, and does not indicate that such marriages were, in the time of David, permissible (<a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>). The exact degree of relationship which existed between Abraham and Sarah is not altogether certain (cf. <a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a> with Genesis 11:29). Ezekiel reckons this sin in the catalogue of the iniquities of Jerusalem (<a href="/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have sexual relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1540.htm">Strong's 1540: </a> </span><span class="str2">To denude, to exile, to reveal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your sister,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1444;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
