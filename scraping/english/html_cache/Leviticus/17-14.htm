Blood was seen as the life force, a belief that underscores many of the sacrificial practices in the Old Testament. In <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>, God commands Noah not to consume blood, establishing a precedent for this prohibition. Theologically, this connection between life and blood foreshadows the sacrificial system and ultimately points to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood is said to bring eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>Therefore I have told the Israelites,</b><br>God's direct communication with the Israelites highlights the covenant relationship between Him and His chosen people. This command is part of the Holiness Code, a section of Leviticus (chapters 17-26) that outlines how the Israelites are to live as a holy nation. The specificity of the audience underscores the unique identity and calling of Israel among the nations, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>.<p><b>&#8216;You must not eat the blood of any living thing,</b><br>This prohibition is not only a dietary restriction but also a spiritual mandate. It distinguishes the Israelites from surrounding nations, many of whom practiced blood consumption in their rituals. The command reflects a respect for life and the sanctity of blood, which is reserved for atonement purposes (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This restriction is reiterated in the New Testament, where the apostles instruct Gentile believers to abstain from blood (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>).<p><b>because the life of all flesh is its blood;</b><br>Repetition of this principle reinforces its importance. The life-blood connection is central to understanding the sacrificial system, where blood is used for atonement, symbolizing the life given in place of another. This concept is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Christ's blood is described as the means of atonement for sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<p><b>whoever eats it must be cut off.&#8217;</b><br>The severe consequence of being "cut off" indicates the gravity of this command. In the context of ancient Israel, being cut off could mean excommunication from the community or divine judgment. This underscores the holiness required of God's people and the seriousness of maintaining purity. The phrase also points to the ultimate separation from God that sin causes, a theme that is resolved through the reconciliation offered by Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws of Leviticus were given.

it carries the sacred value of the life God has breathed into every creature (<a href="/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore I have told the Israelites</b><p>- The Lord&#8217;s command is not arbitrary but flows directly from the life-in-the-blood principle.<p>- Israel, as God&#8217;s covenant people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>), receives this revelation so they will relate rightly to Him and handle life with reverence (<a href="/leviticus/17-2.htm">Leviticus 17:2</a>).<p>- Obedience would mark them as distinct from surrounding nations that practiced blood-drinking in occult rituals (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You must not eat the blood of any living thing</b><p>- The negative command protects both theology and community identity.<p>&#8226; It teaches that life belongs to God alone and should never be consumed as common food (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; It safeguards Israel from pagan associations (<a href="/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35-38</a>).<p>&#8226; It anticipates New Testament guidance for Gentile believers, who are likewise told to &#8220;abstain&#8230;from blood&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>).<p>- While health benefits may follow, the primary motive is worshipful obedience, not dietary science.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because the life of all flesh is its blood</b><p>- The repetition underscores gravity: God is defending the sanctity of life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>).<p>- By making the reason explicit again, He leaves no room for debate or cultural revision.<p>- The statement points forward to the ultimate saving blood of Christ, whose poured-out life secures eternal redemption (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever eats it must be cut off</b><p>- &#8220;Cut off&#8221; conveys severe covenant penalty&#8212;either capital punishment or exclusion from the community (<a href="/leviticus/7-27.htm">Leviticus 7:27</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-20.htm">Numbers 19:20</a>).<p>- Such severity shows the seriousness of treating life&#8212;and ultimately God&#8217;s holiness&#8212;as something cheap or common.<p>- Respect for blood prepares hearts to grasp the costliness of the cross, where Jesus offers His blood so believers might have life (<a href="/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53-54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a> teaches that blood is sacred because it carries life, a gift that belongs to God. Israel is therefore forbidden to consume blood, distinguishing them from idolatry and reinforcing the theology of substitutionary sacrifice. The stern penalty highlights the seriousness of violating God&#8217;s holiness. Ultimately, the verse anticipates the saving blood of Christ, calling believers in every age to honor life, trust God&#8217;s revealed order, and find redemption in the poured-out life of the Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">For</span> <span class= "bld">it is the life of all flesh . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">for the soul of all flesh is its blood, in, or through, its soul, </span>that is, the sacredness of the blood arises from the fact that it contains the vital principle of all animal life.
