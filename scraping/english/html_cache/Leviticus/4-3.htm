His role was crucial as a mediator between God and the Israelites. His sin had significant implications, as it could lead the entire community astray. This highlights the importance of leadership integrity and the communal impact of sin. The concept of an anointed leader foreshadows Christ, the ultimate High Priest, who is sinless and mediates a new covenant.<p><b>bringing guilt on the people</b><br>The priest's sin had a corporate effect, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the community. In ancient Israel, the high priest represented the people before God, and his actions could bring collective guilt. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders bear responsibility for their followers, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in the story of King David's census (2 Samuel 24).<p><b>he must bring to the LORD a young bull without blemish</b><br>The requirement of a young bull signifies the gravity of the priest's sin, as bulls were the most valuable sacrificial animals. The stipulation that the bull be without blemish underscores the need for purity and perfection in offerings to God, prefiguring Christ as the spotless Lamb of God (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). This requirement also reflects the high standards God sets for those who serve Him.<p><b>as a sin offering</b><br>The sin offering was a specific type of sacrifice designed to atone for unintentional sins and restore the sinner's relationship with God. This offering involved the shedding of blood, pointing to the necessity of atonement through sacrifice.

Even the high priest was not exempt from the need for atonement. It serves as a reminder that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), and it points to the need for a perfect mediator, fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/anointed_priest.htm">Anointed Priest</a></b><br>This refers to the high priest, who was consecrated and set apart for the service of God.

By this the Levitical law indicates that even the chief of the priesthood was but a frail being like the rest of the people, and was exposed to the same infirmities as the laity, thus precluding the assumption of spiritual superiority. Hence the remark of the Apostle, "the law made those high priests who had infirmity, and who needed daily to offer up sacrifices, first for their own sins, and then for the people's; but our high priest, Christ Jesus, was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens" (<a href="/context/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27-28</a>). The phrase "the priest that is anointed" for "the high priest" is restricted to this book, where it occurs four times (<a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm" title="If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he has sinned, a young bullock without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-5.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/4-16.htm" title="And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:">Leviticus 4:16</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-15.htm" title="And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is on the meat offering, and shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell, even the memorial of it, to the LORD.">Leviticus 6:15</a> in Heb.; 22 in the English).

He is called "the anointed priest," because, like Aaron, he alone was anointed when he succeeded to the high office, whilst the ordinary priests were simply consecrated. Their anointing descended with them to all futurity by virtue of being the descendants of Aaron. (See <a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm" title="And he poured of the anointing oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.">Leviticus 8:12</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-12.</span> - The case of the high priest. He is designated the <span class="cmt_word">priest that is anointed</span>, in respect to which title, see notes on chapter 8. In case he sins in his representative character, his sin is such as <span class="accented">to bring guilt on the people</span> (this is the meaning of the words translated <span class="cmt_word">according to the sin of the people</span>), and a special sin offering must therefore be made. He is to <span class="cmt_word">take of the blood</span> of the animal sacrificed, and <span class="cmt_word">bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:... and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense.</span> This was a more solemn method of presenting the blood to the Lord than that used in the burnt offering; the offering of the blood, which was the vehicle of life, being the chief feature in the sin offering, as the consumption of the whole animal by the altar fire was in the burnt offering. In the burnt offerings and peace offerings the blood was thrown once on the altar of burnt sacrifice (see chapter Leviticus 1:5); now it is sprinkled, in a smaller quantity each <span class="accented">time</span>, but as often as seven times (the number seven symbolically representing completeness), before the vail which shrouded the ark. <span class="accented">The altar of sweet incense</span> is the golden altar, which stood within the tabernacle, in front of the vail. Perhaps the reason why <span class="accented">the horns of the altar</span> are specially appointed to have the blood placed on them is that they were regarded as the most sacred part of the altar, because they were its highest points, in which its elevation towards heaven culminated. The remainder of the victim's blood is to be poured <span class="cmt_word">at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering</span>, in the court of the tabernacle, to sink into the ground, because no more of it was wanted for ceremonial use. The internal fat is to be burnt upon the altar of the burnt offering, but not actually upon the smoldering burnt sacrifice, as in the case of the peace offerings; the sin offering preceding the burnt offering in order of time, while the peace offering followed it. The remainder of the animal <span class="cmt_word">is to be carried without the camp... and be burnt</span>, because its flesh was at once accursed and most holy. It was accursed, as having been symbolically the vehicle of the sins laid upon it by the offerer; therefore it must not be consumed upon the altar of God, but be destroyed with fire outside the camp, typifying the removal from God's kingdom, and the final destruction of all that is sinful. But yet it was most holy, as its blood had been taken into the tabernacle, and had served as a propitiation; therefore, if it had to be burnt, it yet had to be burnt solemnly, reverently, and as a ceremonial act, in a place appointed for the purpose. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that one of the points in which our Lord was the antitype of the sin offering was that he "suffered without the gate," "that he might sanctify the people with his own blood" (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), which was thus indicated to have been carried within the sanctuary, that is, into heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the anointed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
