The examination of mildew, or mold, was part of their duty to maintain the community's purity and health. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where physical cleanliness often symbolizes spiritual purity. The priest's role here prefigures Christ as our High Priest, who examines and purifies our lives from sin.<p><b>and isolate the contaminated fabric</b><br>Isolation was a common practice to prevent the spread of disease or impurity. This reflects the biblical principle of separation from sin and uncleanliness. In a broader sense, it underscores the importance of community health and the need to protect the congregation from spiritual and physical contamination. This practice can be seen as a type of the separation from sin that Christ accomplishes for believers.<p><b>for seven days.</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often signifies completeness or perfection, as seen in the creation week. The seven-day period allowed time for observation and potential healing, symbolizing God's perfect timing and the completeness of His work. This period of waiting can be seen as a type of the sanctification process, where believers are set apart and made holy through Christ over time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

Mean</div><b>And the priest</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-50.htm">Leviticus 13:50</a> begins, &#8220;And the priest&#8230;&#8221;.<p>- God appoints priests to act as mediators between Himself and the people (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p>- Their presence highlights that holiness is not self-defined; it is assessed by someone God ordains.<p>- In the broader context of Christ, our High Priest now examines our lives (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14&#8211;15</a>), yet the standard of holiness remains unchanged.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is to examine</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;is to examine&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Careful inspection prevents hasty judgments and protects the community (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-4.htm">Deuteronomy 17:4</a>).<p>- Scripture frequently calls leaders to &#8220;examine everything carefully&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>) so that truth&#8212;not rumor&#8212;guides decisions.<p>- This practice guards against both neglect and overreaction, modeling a balanced, discerning spirit (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the mildew</b><p>We read, &#8220;&#8230;the mildew&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Mildew (or mold) represents hidden, spreading corruption&#8212;an image of sin that grows if ignored (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>).<p>- Its presence in garments illustrates how impurity infiltrates everyday life, not just sacred spaces (<a href="/mark/7-20.htm">Mark 7:20-23</a>).<p>- Addressing physical mildew trains Israel to recognize and confront moral decay promptly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and isolate the contaminated fabric</b><p>The instruction says, &#8220;&#8230;and isolate the contaminated fabric&#8230;&#8221;<p>- Quarantine protects others from defilement (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>).<p>- Separation is a recurring biblical principle: &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p>- By isolating the item&#8212;not discarding it immediately&#8212;God pairs mercy with caution, allowing time for possible restoration (<a href="/leviticus/13-54.htm">Leviticus 13:54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for seven days</b><p>Finally, &#8220;&#8230;for seven days.&#8221;<p>- Seven symbolizes completeness and God&#8217;s perfect order (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<p>- A full week gives adequate time for the mildew&#8217;s nature to become clear, ensuring just action (<a href="/leviticus/13-51.htm">Leviticus 13:51</a>).<p>- The rhythm of seven invites reflection and rests in God&#8217;s timing rather than impulsive human urgency (<a

carefully examines suspected corruption, isolates it to protect the community, and waits a complete, God-defined period before rendering judgment.
