In the broader context of <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, God provides dietary laws to the Israelites, distinguishing between clean and unclean animals. The mention of "flying insects that walk on all fours" refers to a category of creatures that are generally considered unclean, yet here, an exception is made. This reflects the detailed nature of the Mosaic Law, which aimed to set Israel apart from other nations through distinct practices. The specificity of these laws underscores the importance of obedience and holiness in the daily lives of the Israelites.<p><b>those having jointed legs above their feet for hopping on the ground.</b><br>This phrase specifies the criteria that make certain flying insects permissible to eat. The "jointed legs above their feet" likely refers to the anatomy of locusts and similar insects, which are capable of hopping. In the ancient Near East, locusts were a common food source, especially in times of scarcity. This provision allowed the Israelites to utilize a readily available resource while still adhering to the dietary laws. The mention of "hopping on the ground" further clarifies the type of movement that distinguishes these insects from others. This detail highlights the precision of God's instructions and the care taken to ensure that the Israelites could maintain their covenant relationship with Him through obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Leviticus, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator of God's laws to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as they journeyed through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean_animals.htm">Clean and Unclean Animals</a></b><br>The focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, where God provides dietary laws distinguishing between animals that can be eaten and those that cannot.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The dietary laws in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, including verse 21, underscore the call to holiness and separation from pagan practices.

The same pattern of restriction followed by permission shows up in <a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>, where Adam was freely allowed to eat from every tree except one. <a href="/deuteronomy/14-19.htm">Deuteronomy 14:19-20</a> echoes this permission regarding certain winged insects, reinforcing that God&#8217;s dietary guidelines were consistent and purposeful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the following kinds of flying insects</b><p>The Lord narrows the focus to a specific subset within the broad category of &#8220;all the winged insects&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-20.htm">Leviticus 11:20</a>). &#8220;Kinds&#8221; reminds us of God&#8217;s orderly creation in <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-25</a>, where each creature reproduces &#8220;according to its kind.&#8221; By specifying kinds, God guards Israel from guesswork and from imitating the surrounding nations&#8217; indiscriminate habits (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that walk on all fours</b><p>To an ancient observer, insects appeared to have four primary walking legs, even though they also have front appendages used for handling food.
