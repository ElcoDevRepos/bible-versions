This practice was common among neighboring pagan cultures, such as the Canaanites, who often relied on necromancy and divination. The prohibition underscores the importance of seeking guidance solely from God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, which lists these practices among those detestable to the Lord.<p><b>to prostitute himself with them</b><br>The use of the term "prostitute" indicates a spiritual unfaithfulness akin to adultery. In the biblical context, Israel is often depicted as the bride of God, and turning to other sources for guidance is seen as a betrayal of that covenant relationship. This metaphor is consistent with the prophetic writings, such as in Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital unfaithfulness.<p><b>I will also set My face against that person</b><br>This phrase signifies God's active opposition and judgment. In biblical terms, God setting His face against someone implies a withdrawal of His favor and protection, leading to dire consequences. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God's favor is associated with blessing and His opposition with judgment, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where the Lord's face shining upon someone is a sign of blessing.<p><b>and cut him off from his people</b><br>Being "cut off" from the people of Israel was a severe punishment, often implying death or excommunication. This phrase indicates the seriousness of the offense and the need to maintain the purity and holiness of the community. It reflects the covenantal nature of Israel's relationship with God, where communal holiness was paramount, as seen in the broader context of Leviticus, which emphasizes holiness and separation from pagan practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mediums_and_spiritists.htm">Mediums and Spiritists</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to communicate with the dead or spirits, often associated with occult practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who sets forth laws and consequences for His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the laws from God through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who conveyed God's laws to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Turning to mediums and spiritists is a form of idolatry, as it places trust in something other than God.
