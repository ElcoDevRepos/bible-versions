This reflects the broader biblical principle that God's laws were meant to guide all who lived within the community of Israel, emphasizing the unity and holiness required of God's people. The inclusion of foreigners highlights the universal nature of God's covenant and foreshadows the New Testament teaching that salvation through Christ is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten</b><br>The context here is the provision of food through hunting, which was a common practice in ancient times. The specification of "wild animal or bird that may be eaten" aligns with the dietary laws outlined in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which distinguish between clean and unclean animals. This reflects the importance of maintaining ritual purity and obedience to God's commands regarding food, which were integral to the Israelites' identity and relationship with God.<p><b>he must drain its blood</b><br>The command to drain the blood underscores the biblical principle that life is in the blood (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This reflects the sanctity of life and the belief that blood, as the life force, belongs to God alone. The draining of blood before consumption is a practice that sets the Israelites apart from surrounding nations and their pagan rituals, which often involved consuming blood. This practice also prefigures the sacrificial system and ultimately points to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the atonement of sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and cover it with dirt</b><br>Covering the blood with dirt is an act of respect and reverence for the life that was taken. This practice acknowledges God's sovereignty over life and death and serves as a reminder of the gravity of taking a life, even for sustenance. It also symbolizes the return of life to the earth, from which humanity was created (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). This act of covering the blood can be seen as a precursor to the burial of Christ, who was laid in a tomb, symbolizing the covering of sin through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who are the chosen people of God.

Hitherto the law mainly discussed the blood of sacrificial animals, or those quadrupeds which were slaughtered at home. In this and the following verses the statute is extended to all other creatures which, though wild, are legally clean and used as food.<p><span class= "bld">Which hunteth and catcheth.</span>--Hunting, which was an amusement with other nations of antiquity, was with the serious Hebrew a matter of necessity. It was resorted to as a matter of necessity to exterminate dangerous beasts (<a href="/exodus/23-29.htm" title="I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.">Exodus 23:29</a>), but more especially to procure food (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm" title="And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.">Genesis 25:27</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-27.htm" title="The slothful man roasts not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.">Proverbs 12:27</a>). Besides the numerous pitfalls, snares, traps, &c, which are so frequently mentioned in the Bible, the Hebrews also employed arms in catching game (<a href="/genesis/27-3.htm" title="Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;">Genesis 27:3</a>). When wounded, or when the game had to be killed to facilitate its being carried home, the hunters were liable to become careless about the blood, as is evident from the practice which obtained among some of the ancients. Thus we are told that the Zabians, when they slew a beast, put the blood into a vessel or into a hole which they dug in the ground, and then sat round and feasted on it. It is to prevent such outrages on the sacred blood, which the hunters were especially liable to commit when hungry, that the law is here enacted. An instance of the hungry army flying upon the spoil, killing the cattle in the field, and eating the flesh with the blood, is recorded in <a href="/context/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32-34</a>.
