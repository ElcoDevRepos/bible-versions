In the ancient Near Eastern context, this was a common legal principle, also found in the Code of Hammurabi. It served to limit retribution and prevent escalating cycles of violence. The term "neighbor" here is significant, as it implies a fellow member of the Israelite community, emphasizing the importance of maintaining harmony and justice within the covenant people. This principle underscores the value of human life and the need for fairness in interpersonal relationships.<p><b>whatever he has done</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the concept of proportional justice. The punishment or restitution must correspond directly to the injury inflicted. This reflects the broader biblical theme of justice and righteousness, where actions have consequences, and individuals are held accountable for their deeds. It also points to the meticulous nature of the Mosaic Law, which sought to address various aspects of community life with precision and fairness.<p><b>must be done to him</b><br>This phrase enforces the idea of equitable retribution. It is not merely about punishment but about restoring balance and justice. In the New Testament, Jesus references this principle in <a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>, where He calls His followers to a higher standard of forgiveness and love, moving beyond mere retribution. This reflects the transformative nature of Christ's teachings, which fulfill and transcend the Old Testament law. The principle here also foreshadows the ultimate justice and mercy found in Jesus Christ, who bore the consequences of sin on behalf of humanity, offering grace instead of retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai and communicated them to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the laws, including the laws of retribution, as they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_justice.htm">Understanding Justice</a></b><br>The law of retribution in <a href="/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19</a> emphasizes justice and fairness, ensuring that the punishment fits the crime.

In the covenant community, &#8220;neighbor&#8221; means any fellow member of God&#8217;s people (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, &#8220;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&#8221;).<p>&#8211; Scripture insists that relationships carry moral weight. Hurting a neighbor is never a private matter; it offends the God who commands love (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>).<p>&#8211; By addressing &#8220;anyone,&#8221; the text underscores equal accountability&#8212;kings, priests, or common laborers all come under the same righteous measure (<a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whatever he has done</b><p>&#8211; Justice is linked to the specific act committed. The law does not allow either excessive punishment or light penalty; it matches &#8220;whatever&#8221; harm occurred.<p>&#8211; This guards against personal revenge that might escalate violence (compare <a href="/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23-24</a>, where Lamech boasts of disproportionate payback).<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a> repeats the same pattern, tying retribution to the actual damage: &#8220;life for life, eye for eye&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;a divine safeguard, not a license for cruelty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must be done to him</b><p>&#8211; God delegates measured retribution to lawful authority, ensuring that the wrongdoer experiences the same loss he caused. The principle honors human dignity by treating both victim and offender as moral agents (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-18.htm">Deuteronomy 19:18-21</a>).<p>&#8211; It deters future violence: when justice is swift and proportionate, &#8220;the rest will hear and be afraid&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-20.htm">Deuteronomy 19:20</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus later cites this statute&#8212;&#8220;You have heard that it was said, &#8216;Eye for eye&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>)&#8212;not to cancel civil justice but to urge believers, on a personal level, toward overcoming evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-19</a>). The moral core remains intact while calling Christ-followers to higher grace in individual relationships.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19</a> teaches that every member of God&#8217;s people is answerable for injuries done to another. Justice must be exact, fair, and administered by lawful authority, reflecting God&#8217;s righteous character. Far from encouraging personal vengeance, the verse restrains it, protects the victim, and upholds the dignity of both parties. Later revelation invites believers to go beyond retribution in personal conduct, yet the foundational principle of proportional, impartial justice still displays the holiness and equity of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19, 20) <span class= "bld">And if a man cause a blemish.</span>--See <a href="/context/exodus/21-24.htm" title="Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,">Exodus 21:24-25</a>.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/24-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
