Their examination was not merely medical but also spiritual, as diseases like leprosy were often seen as physical manifestations of spiritual impurity. This reflects the holistic view of health in biblical times, where physical and spiritual well-being were interconnected. The priest's role in examining diseases underscores the importance of maintaining purity within the community, as outlined in Leviticus.<p><b>and if the swelling of the infection</b><br>The term "swelling" indicates a visible change in the skin, which was crucial for diagnosing skin diseases. In the context of Leviticus, such infections were not only health concerns but also matters of ritual purity. The Hebrew word used here can refer to a variety of skin conditions, not just leprosy as understood today. This highlights the need for careful observation and discernment by the priest.<p><b>on his bald head or forehead</b><br>Baldness in the ancient Near East was not uncommon and could be natural or due to disease. The specific mention of the bald head or forehead suggests a visible and potentially more severe manifestation of the disease. In biblical symbolism, the head often represents leadership or authority, and an affliction there could symbolize a deeper spiritual issue affecting one's standing before God.<p><b>is reddish-white like a skin disease</b><br>The description of the infection as "reddish-white" provides a diagnostic criterion for the priest. This specific coloration was associated with certain types of skin diseases, including leprosy. The comparison to a skin disease indicates the seriousness of the condition, as such diseases rendered individuals ceremonially unclean. This unclean status required separation from the community, reflecting the broader biblical theme of holiness and the need for separation from sin.<br><br>This passage, like others in Leviticus, emphasizes the importance of purity and the role of the priesthood in maintaining the community's spiritual and physical health. It also foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on Jesus as the ultimate High Priest, who heals and purifies not just physically but spiritually, offering a deeper cleansing from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, priests served as mediators between God and the people, and they were responsible for diagnosing skin diseases, including leprosy, as part of their duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_infected_person.htm">The Infected Person</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who shows symptoms of a skin disease, which required examination by a priest to determine their status and the necessary actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bald_head_or_forehead.htm">Bald Head or Forehead</a></b><br>The specific location of the infection is significant, as it is visible and thus easily identifiable by the priest.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/skin_disease.htm">Skin Disease</a></b><br>Often translated as "leprosy" in older versions, the Hebrew term "tzaraath" encompasses a range of skin conditions, not just what is known today as leprosy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/examination_process.htm">Examination Process</a></b><br>This was a ritualistic and diagnostic procedure carried out by the priest to maintain the purity of the community and to prevent the spread of disease.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_priest.htm">The Role of the Priest</a></b><br>Priests were not only spiritual leaders but also community health inspectors, showing the integration of physical and spiritual well-being in God's law.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_community_health.htm">Importance of Community Health</a></b><br>The examination and isolation procedures underscore the importance of protecting the community from contagious diseases, a principle still relevant today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_symbolism_of_leprosy.htm">Spiritual Symbolism of Leprosy</a></b><br>Leprosy often symbolizes sin in the Bible, representing how sin can spread and defile, requiring cleansing and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_restoration.htm">God's Provision for Restoration</a></b><br>The detailed laws for dealing with skin diseases reflect God's care for both the individual and the community, providing a way for restoration and reintegration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus emphasize the need for holiness and purity, both physically and spiritually, as a reflection of God's nature.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_13_43_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 13:43?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_13_43_Community_health_focus.htm">How does Leviticus 13:43 emphasize the importance of community health and purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Priest_s_role_in_spiritual_leadership.htm">What does "the priest shall examine him" teach about spiritual leadership responsibilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_13_43_and_NT_holiness_link.htm">How does Leviticus 13:43 connect to New Testament teachings on holiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Leviticus_13_43_inform_health.htm">In what ways can we apply Leviticus 13:43 to modern health practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Lev_13_43_enhance_law_insight.htm">How does understanding Leviticus 13:43 deepen our appreciation for God's laws on cleanliness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_13_43_Israelite_disease_views.htm">What does Leviticus 13:43 reveal about ancient Israelite views on disease and impurity?

God entrusted diagnosis to qualified priests, not to personal opinion.<p>- This preserves community purity and protects the vulnerable, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>, where the people are told to &#8220;be careful and diligently observe whatever the Levitical priests instruct you.&#8221;<p>- The process foreshadows Christ our High Priest who alone can truly assess and cleanse (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-15</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: accountability and authoritative evaluation matter; sin and sickness are not left to self-diagnosis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if the swelling of the infection</b><p>- &#8220;Swelling&#8221; points to something raised&#8212;visible, undeniable. Sin likewise surfaces; it cannot remain hidden (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p>- The priest looks for progression, distinguishing temporary irritation from genuine uncleanness, much like <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> urges spiritual believers to restore someone caught in a trespass, discerning true need.<p>- The conditional &#8220;if&#8221; underlines fairness; no one is condemned without evidence (<a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on his bald head or forehead</b><p>- Baldness itself was not defiling (<a href="/leviticus/13-40.htm">Leviticus 13:40-41</a>). The location is specified so natural hair loss is not mistaken for leprosy.<p>- God makes careful provision for every circumstance, showing He values both accuracy and compassion (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>).<p>- The visibility of the forehead highlights how uncleanness&#8212;spiritual or physical&#8212;cannot be concealed indefinitely (<a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is reddish-white like a skin disease</b><p>- &#8220;Reddish-white&#8221; matches earlier leprous signs (<a href="/leviticus/13-19.htm">Leviticus 13:19</a>). Exact coloration ensures uniform judgment, preventing bias.<p>- The description reminds us that sin often appears mixed&#8212;part inflamed, part pale&#8212;signifying both active rebellion and decaying purity (<a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6, 18</a>).<p>- Just as the priest awaited unmistakable evidence before declaring one unclean, believers are called to patient, truthful assessment (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/13-43.htm">Leviticus 13:43</a> lays out a meticulous, God-given process: the priest examines visible evidence on even the most exposed part of the body, ensuring that only genuine cases of uncleanness are declared unclean. The passage underscores divine concern for holiness, justice, and compassionate accuracy, while pointing ahead to Christ the ultimate Priest who perfectly diagnoses and heals both body and soul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">Then the priest shall look.</span>--It is then the duty of the priest to ascertain whether the white-reddish rising in the bald backhead or bald forehead is in appearance like the leprosy in the skin of the flesh described in <a href="/leviticus/13-2.htm" title="When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:">Leviticus 13:2</a>, excepting, of course, the white hair, which in this case could not exist.<p><span class= "bld">As the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in appearance like the leprosy in the skin of the flesh. </span>Though the reddish-white eruption is the only symptom mentioned whereby head-leprosy is to be recognised, and nothing is said about remanding the patient if the distemper should appear doubtful, as in the other cases of leprosy, yet because it is here said "in appearance like the leprosy in the skin of the flesh," the administrators of the law during the second Temple inferred that <span class= "ital">all </span>the criteria specified in one are implied in the other. They interpret this phrase, "they are, and therefore must be treated like, leprosy in the skin of the flesh." Hence they submit that there are two symptoms which render baldness in the front or at the back of the head unclean: viz., (1) live or sound flesh; and (2) spreading. "If live or sound flesh is found in the bright spot on the baldness at the back or in the front of the head, he is pronounced unclean; if there is no live flesh, he is shut up, and examined at the end of the week, and if live flesh has developed itself, and it has spread, he is declared unclean, and if not, he is shut up for another week. If it spreads during this time, or engenders live flesh, he is declared unclean, and if not, he is declared clean. He is also pronounced unclean if it spreads or engenders sound flesh after he has been declared clean." Of course, the fact that the distemper in this instance develops itself on baldness precludes white hair being among the criteria indicating uncleanness.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
