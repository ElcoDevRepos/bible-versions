In ancient Israel, land was a crucial asset, representing both livelihood and inheritance. The inability to redeem the land highlights the economic struggles faced by some families. This provision underscores the importance of land in Israelite society and the need for mechanisms to prevent permanent loss of family inheritance.<p><b>what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer</b><br>The buyer holds the land until the Year of Jubilee if the original owner cannot redeem it. This reflects the temporary nature of property transactions in Israel, where land was not permanently transferred but rather leased. The buyer benefits from the land's produce until the Jubilee, which serves as a reminder of the temporary stewardship of earthly possessions.<p><b>until the Year of Jubilee</b><br>The Year of Jubilee occurred every 50th year and was a time of liberation and restoration. It was a unique institution in Israelite law, ensuring that economic disparities did not become permanent. The Jubilee reflects God's desire for social justice and equality, emphasizing that the land ultimately belongs to Him (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption and restoration found in Christ, who proclaims the "year of the Lord's favor" (<a href="/luke/4-19.htm">Luke 4:19</a>).<p><b>In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released</b><br>During the Jubilee, all sold land was to be returned to its original family owners. This release symbolizes freedom and restoration, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. It serves as a type of the spiritual release and redemption offered through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin and restores them to their intended inheritance in God's kingdom.<p><b>so that he may return to his property</b><br>The return to one's property signifies the restoration of family heritage and stability. It ensures that each family maintains its God-given inheritance, preventing the permanent disenfranchisement of any tribe or family. This return is a powerful image of God's faithfulness and the hope of restoration, paralleling the believer's return to a right relationship with God through Christ. The Jubilee year thus becomes a prophetic picture of the ultimate restoration of all things in the new creation (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, to whom the laws of Leviticus were given.

The design of this law was to secure to each family a permanent interest in the soil, and to prevent the accumulation of land on the part of the greedy few who are ever anxious to join field unto field, thus precluding the existence of landless beggars and too extensive landed proprietors. To the same effect were the laws of inheritance (<a href="/context/numbers/27-6.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 27:6-11</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/36-5.htm" title="And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph has said well.">Numbers 36:5-13</a>). Similar laws obtained among other nations of antiquity. Laws were enacted that the lots which were distributed among the inhabitants were neither to be sold nor bought. Solon made it a law that no one should acquire as much land as he wished; whilst Plato held that no individual person is to possess more than four times the quantity of land than the lowest owner, who had only a single lot.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
