The fat of an animal was considered the best part and was often reserved for offerings to God. However, animals that died naturally or were killed by predators were considered unclean (<a href="/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39-40</a>). This reflects the broader biblical principle of avoiding contact with death and decay, which symbolizes sin and separation from God. The prohibition also served a practical purpose, as consuming such meat could pose health risks due to potential spoilage or disease.<p><b>may be used for any other purpose</b><br>While the fat from these animals was not to be consumed, it could be used for other non-dietary purposes, such as making soap or oil for lamps. This allowance shows a practical aspect of the law, recognizing the need to utilize resources without compromising ritual purity. It reflects the principle of stewardship, using what is available wisely and responsibly.<p><b>but you must not eat it</b><br>The prohibition against eating the fat of such animals underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the maintenance of holiness. Eating the fat of unclean animals would defile the individual, making them unfit for worship and community participation. This command also points to the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and the call to live a life set apart for God. In the New Testament, this concept is fulfilled in Christ, who calls believers to spiritual purity and holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).

In the sacrificial system, the fat was regarded as the choicest portion that belonged to the LORD alone (<a href="/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3-5</a>; 7:23; 17:6).<p>&#8226; By singling out &#8220;the fat,&#8221; the verse reminds Israel that even outside the sanctuary daily life was to reflect the same reverence shown in worship.<p>&#8226; The instruction underscores that all parts of creation have a God-given order and purpose, reinforcing the call to holiness found in <a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>found dead or mauled by wild beasts</b><p>&#8226; Any animal that died naturally or was torn by predators was ceremonially unclean because its blood had not been properly drained (<a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Contact with such carcasses brought defilement (<a href="/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39-40</a>), so this clause highlights the need to maintain ritual purity while still handling everyday realities like predators and accidents.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows God&#8217;s practical concern for His people&#8217;s health and spiritual distinctiveness, echoing His protective heart in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-11</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may be used for any other purpose</b><p>&#8226; The fat could serve practical uses&#8212;fuel for lamps, waterproofing, leather treatment, or trade&#8212;demonstrating responsible stewardship rather than waste (compare <a href="/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This allowance balances purity with providence: while Israel must not consume it, they may still benefit materially, similar to the way a carcass could be given or sold to a foreigner (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law thus promotes resourcefulness without compromising the covenant&#8217;s moral and ceremonial boundaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you must not eat it</b><p>&#8226; The consumption ban is absolute (reiterated in <a href="/leviticus/7-23.htm">Leviticus 7:23-25</a>); eating such fat would incur guilt and require atonement.<p>&#8226; Obedience here is an act of worship, aligning everyday meals with the sacrificial principle that &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning anticipates later teaching that defilement comes from what one takes in (<a href="/mark/7-20.htm">Mark 7:20-23</a>) and prepares the way for the New Covenant call to honor God with the body (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-24.htm">Leviticus 7:24</a> draws a clear line between what may be used and what may be eaten, teaching that holiness extends beyond the altar into ordinary tasks.
