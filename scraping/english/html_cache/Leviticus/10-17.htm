The sin offering, according to Levitical law, was to be consumed by the priests in a designated holy area within the tabernacle complex. This act symbolized the priests' role in bearing the sins of the people and facilitating atonement. The failure to eat the offering in the prescribed manner could signify a breach of ritual purity and obedience, which was critical in maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and the community's relationship with God.<p><b>For it is most holy;</b><br>The designation "most holy" indicates the highest level of sanctity attributed to certain offerings, requiring strict adherence to divine instructions. This classification underscores the offering's role in the sacred rituals of atonement and reconciliation with God. The term "most holy" is used to emphasize the seriousness and the divine nature of the offering, setting it apart from other sacrifices and requiring it to be handled with utmost reverence and care.<p><b>it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation</b><br>The sin offering was a provision from God to the priests, enabling them to mediate between the Israelites and God. By consuming the offering, the priests symbolically absorbed the people's sins, facilitating their removal and the restoration of communal purity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of substitutionary atonement, where the innocent bears the guilt of the guilty, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who takes away the sins of the world.<p><b>by making atonement for them before the LORD.</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through prescribed sacrificial rituals. The priests' role in making atonement was central to maintaining the covenant relationship between Israel and God. This phrase highlights the mediatory function of the priesthood, which finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the great High Priest, who offers Himself as the perfect atoning sacrifice, reconciling humanity to God once and for all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is addressing Aaron and his sons in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest and brother of Moses, responsible for performing the priestly duties.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_and_ithamar.htm">Eleazar and Ithamar</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron, who were expected to follow the priestly instructions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary.htm">The Sanctuary</a></b><br>The holy place where the priests were to perform their duties and eat the sin offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_offering.htm">The Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering made to atone for the sins of the people, symbolizing purification and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god's_commands.htm">The Holiness of God&#8217;s Commands</a></b><br>God's instructions are to be followed with reverence and precision.

The sin offering was to be eaten in the holy place because it was &#8220;most holy,&#8221; a gift for removing Israel&#8217;s guilt through priestly mediation before the LORD. Moses&#8217; question highlights the gravity of maintaining holiness, obeying God&#8217;s detailed instructions, and trusting His appointed way for sin to be borne away.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Wherefore have ye not eaten? . . . --</span>As enjoined in <a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm" title="The priest that offers it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.">Leviticus 6:26</a>.<p><span class= "bld">God hath given it.</span>--That is, He has given to you the flesh of the sin offering to cat.

Accordingly the flesh of the sin offering is given to the priests, that by the act of eating it they may visibly show the offerer that God has graciously accepted the expiatory sacrifice, and that it is a most holy thing. The phrase "to bear iniquity" often signifies "to bear away, to remove, to forgive iniquity." (Comp. <a href="/genesis/1-17.htm" title="And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,">Genesis 1:17</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.">Psalm 32:5</a>, &c.) Hence the most ancient Versions translate it here, "that ye may take <span class= "ital">away </span>or <span class= "ital">remove</span>" (LXX., the Chaldee, the Syriac, &c.). The rendering of the Authorised Version, however, is that of the Vulgate, which has been followed by the Reformers both in England and on the continent, as well as by several modern expositors. This is supported by the meaning of the phrase "to bear the iniquity" in <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm" title="And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.">Exodus 28:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.">Numbers 18:1</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/4-4.htm" title="Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>. Those who follow this rendering take the passage to mean that the priest, by eating or incorporating the victim on which the offerer had laid his guilt, actually took away the sin, or neutralised it in a mysterious way, by virtue of the sanctifying power belonging to the sacerdotal office. Others, again, who also take the phrase to mean that the priest literally takes the sin upon himself, do not explain it, but simply say, that by eating the sin-laden victim the sins of the offerer were, <span class= "ital">in some sort, </span>laid upon the priest to be taken away by him, thus prefiguring Christ, who should be both priest and sacrifice. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/10-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mad&#183;d&#363;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4069.htm">Strong's 4069: </a> </span><span class="str2">Why? for what reason?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did you not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sin offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
