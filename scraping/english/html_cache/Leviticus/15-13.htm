In the ancient Near Eastern context, bodily discharges were often associated with impurity. The cleansing process signifies a return to ritual purity, necessary for participation in community and worship activities. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from impurity and the need for holiness.<p><b>he must count off seven days for his cleansing</b><br>The number seven is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The seven-day period ensures that the healing is complete and that the individual is fully restored. This mirrors the creation week, where God completed His work in seven days, and it underscores the importance of thoroughness in the purification process.<p><b>wash his clothes</b><br>Washing clothes is a symbolic act of removing impurity and is a common biblical motif for purification. In the ancient world, clothing often represented one's status and identity, so washing them signifies a renewal of the person&#8217;s social and spiritual status. This act is reminiscent of the New Testament call to put on the new self, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>.<p><b>and bathe himself in fresh water</b><br>Bathing in fresh water is a physical act of cleansing that has spiritual implications. Water is a recurring symbol of purification and life throughout the Bible. This act prefigures Christian baptism, which signifies spiritual cleansing and rebirth. The use of fresh water emphasizes the need for purity and renewal.<p><b>and he shall be clean</b><br>The declaration of cleanliness marks the end of the purification process and the restoration of the individual to the community. This reflects the biblical principle that God desires His people to be holy and set apart. It also points to the ultimate cleansing from sin that is available through Jesus Christ, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, where the blood of Jesus purifies us from all sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_discharge.htm">The Man with the Discharge</a></b><br>This refers to an individual experiencing a bodily discharge, which rendered him ceremonially unclean according to the Levitical law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/cleansing_process.htm">Cleansing Process</a></b><br>The process outlined for the man to become ceremonially clean again, involving a waiting period, washing of clothes, and bathing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_days.htm">Seven Days</a></b><br>A period of time significant in biblical terms, often associated with completion and purification.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fresh_water.htm">Fresh Water</a></b><br>Symbolic of purity and renewal, used in the cleansing process.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonial_law.htm">Ceremonial Law</a></b><br>The broader context of Leviticus, which includes various laws given to the Israelites to maintain holiness and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity.htm">The Importance of Purity</a></b><br>The passage emphasizes the need for purity and cleanliness, both physically and spiritually.

This signals the first sign of restoration. In <a href="/leviticus/15-1.htm">Leviticus 15:1-12</a> the Lord details why any bodily discharge makes a person ceremonially unclean; here He shows the way back. The pause between the illness and the ritual underlines God&#8217;s compassion&#8212;He waits until the man is truly better before requiring anything further. Compare the pause in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-10.htm">Deuteronomy 23:10-11</a> where soldiers wait &#8220;until evening&#8221; after an emission; God allows recovery before worship is resumed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He must count off seven days for his cleansing</b><p>The full week mirrors other seven-day periods of purification such as <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-12</a> for contact with a corpse and <a href="/leviticus/12-2.htm">Leviticus 12:2</a> for childbirth.

Washing clothes does three things:<p>&#8226; Removes any residual contamination (<a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Gives visible evidence of inward change (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Prepares him to re-enter worship purified, just as priests washed their garments before service (<a href="/exodus/28-42.htm">Exodus 28:42-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bathe himself in fresh water</b><p>&#8220;Fresh water&#8221; (literally &#8220;living water&#8221;) points to running or spring water, not stagnant pools (<a href="/leviticus/14-5.htm">Leviticus 14:5-6</a>).

Each step reveals the Lord&#8217;s desire for complete restoration and prefigures the deeper cleansing fulfilled in Christ, who provides the ultimate &#8220;living water&#8221; and declares every trusting believer clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And when he . . . is cleansed of his issue.</span>--That is, recovered or healed of his infirmity (see <a href="/leviticus/15-28.htm" title="But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.">Leviticus 15:28</a>), as the real purification was not accomplished till he had performed the ritual prescribed in this and in the two following verses. He is, however, not to perform these rites as soon as he finds that the issue has ceased, but has to wait seven clear days, so as to afford sufficient time to ascertain whether the infirmity had actually disappeared. If any vestige of it was seen during these seven days, or even at the end of the seventh day, and after he was baptized, he had again to count seven other days.<p><span class= "bld">Bathe his flesh in running water.</span>--Or, more literally, <span class= "ital">living water. </span>It will be seen that whilst all other defiled persons and things were to be immersed in a collection of water, the restored man who had suffered from the issue in question was ordered to bathe in a fountain or in spring water. For the phrase "living water," see <a href="/leviticus/14-5.htm" title="And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:">Leviticus 14:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-50.htm" title="And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:">Leviticus 14:50</a>. It is more than probable that the term "flesh" has here, too, the euphemistic sense in which it has hitherto been used in this section. (See <a href="/context/leviticus/15-2.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.">Leviticus 15:2-3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-7.htm" title="And he that touches the flesh of him that has the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:7</a>.) This derives support from the fact that whenever bathing of the body is ordered, the phrase for it throughout this section is uniformly "bathe in water" simply, which occurs no less than ten times (<a href="/context/leviticus/15-5.htm" title="And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:5-8</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/15-10.htm" title="And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that bears any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:10-11</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-18.htm" title="The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:18</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/15-21.htm" title="And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:21-22</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-27.htm" title="And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:27</a>), and where the Authorised Version has in all cases inserted <span class= "ital">himself </span>in italics. This, moreover, seems to be confirmed by the fact that in the only passage in this section where the expression "flesh" is used in its literal sense for "body" (see <a href="/leviticus/15-16.htm" title="And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:16</a>), the sacred writer designedly added (<span class= "ital">?th kol</span>) "all," so that it might be distinguished from the euphemistic sense in which it is used in all the other passages in this section, This, however, would not exclude the bathing of the body as well, but, on the contrary, premises it. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
