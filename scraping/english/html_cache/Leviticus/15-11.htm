The discharge likely refers to a medical condition, possibly a chronic illness, which rendered a person ceremonially unclean. The requirement for rinsing hands with water highlights the importance of ritual purity and hygiene, which were crucial in preventing the spread of disease. This practice reflects the broader Levitical emphasis on cleanliness and holiness, as seen in other passages like <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11-15</a>, which detail various laws on purity. The act of rinsing hands can also be seen as a precursor to later Jewish purification rituals and even Christian baptism, symbolizing spiritual cleansing.<p><b>the one who was touched must wash his clothes and bathe with water</b><br>The requirement for the touched person to wash his clothes and bathe underscores the seriousness of maintaining ritual purity. Washing clothes and bathing were common purification practices in the ancient Near East, serving both practical and symbolic purposes. This act of cleansing is reminiscent of the broader biblical theme of purification, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks to be cleansed with hyssop. The emphasis on washing and bathing also foreshadows the New Testament's focus on spiritual cleansing through Christ, who offers purification from sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><b>and he will be unclean until evening</b><br>The designation of being unclean until evening indicates a temporary state of impurity, which would end with the setting of the sun. This reflects the ancient Israelite understanding of the day, which began at sunset. The temporary nature of the impurity suggests that while physical cleanliness was important, it was not permanent or insurmountable. This concept of temporary uncleanness can be seen as a type pointing to the ultimate cleansing provided by Jesus Christ, who offers eternal purification and reconciliation with God (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>). The evening cleansing also aligns with the biblical theme of renewal and new beginnings, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are new every morning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_discharge.htm">The Man with the Discharge</a></b><br>This refers to an individual experiencing a bodily discharge, which in the context of Leviticus, renders him ceremonially unclean.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_person_touched.htm">The Person Touched</a></b><br>Anyone who comes into contact with the man with the discharge without proper cleansing becomes unclean.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_cleansing.htm">Ritual Cleansing</a></b><br>The process of washing clothes and bathing in water to restore ceremonial cleanliness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uncleanness_until_evening.htm">Uncleanness Until Evening</a></b><br>A period of time during which the person remains ceremonially unclean, emphasizing the temporary nature of this state.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_community.htm">The Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context involves the community of Israel, which is called to maintain holiness and purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus highlight God's call for His people to be holy and set apart.

When the verse says, &#8220;If the man with the discharge touches anyone,&#8221; it is speaking of ordinary human contact&#8212;laying a hand on a shoulder, passing an object, or any sort of physical connection. The point is not that touch itself is sinful, but that God was teaching Israel to recognize the seriousness of uncleanness and its spread, much like sin spreads when unchecked (compare <a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13-14</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rinsing the hands with water</b><p>The man is instructed to &#8220;first rinse his hands with water.&#8221; This practice served at least three purposes:<p>&#8226; Practical hygiene&#8212;reducing the physical transmission of disease (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-12.htm">Deuteronomy 23:12-14</a> foreshadows similar sanitary concern).<p>&#8226; Symbolic cleansing&#8212;reminding the individual that fellowship with a holy God demands purity (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Preventive mercy&#8212;protecting the community from unnecessary uncleanness (<a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45-46</a>).<p>In the tabernacle, priests had to wash hands and feet before service (<a href="/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-21</a>); here, even an unwell layperson was to practice a comparable ritual on a smaller scale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Responsibility shifts to the one touched</b><p>&#8220;If the man with the discharge touches anyone without first rinsing his hands with water, the one who was touched must wash his clothes and bathe with water.&#8221; The burden now falls on the innocent party:<p>&#8226; He or she must launder garments (<a href="/leviticus/11-28.htm">Leviticus 11:28, 13</a>:6) and take a full bath, indicating total cleansing.<p>&#8226; This reinforces personal responsibility&#8212;contact with impurity requires immediate response, just as contact with sin demands confession and cleansing (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It also guards community worship; no one casually brings contamination into the camp or tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Duration of uncleanness: until evening</b><p>&#8220;He will be unclean until evening.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Evening marked the start of a new day in Hebrew reckoning (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>), so the uncleanness was temporary and would lapse naturally after the prescribed washing.<p>&#8226; The time limit reflects grace: God makes a way back to ritual purity without endless penalties (<a href="/leviticus/22-6.htm">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the delay teaches patience and reverence&#8212;approach to God is never careless or automatic (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/15-11.htm">Leviticus 15:11</a> shows God safeguarding His people physically and spiritually. A man with a discharge had to wash his hands before contact; if he failed, anyone he touched had to launder clothes, bathe, and wait until evening. Each step underlines that impurity spreads, cleansing is available, and fellowship with a holy God requires intentional purity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And hath not rinsed his hands in water.</span>--<span class= "bld">If </span>the patient happens to touch any one with his hands without having first washed his hands, the man who has thus been touched by the unwashen hands of the defiled invalid contracts pollution till sundown of the day on which he has been touched.

This is the only instance where the touch of the hand as imparting defilement is expressly mentioned, and where the washing of the hands alone is ordered in the Mosaic-Law to prevent the communication of pollution.
