Washing clothes and bathing were symbolic acts of cleansing from impurity, often associated with sin or contact with unclean things. In the broader context of Leviticus, these acts were necessary to maintain holiness and separation from the surrounding pagan cultures. The requirement for washing and bathing can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of baptism, which symbolizes spiritual cleansing and renewal (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The emphasis on physical cleanliness reflects the deeper spiritual truth of needing to be cleansed from sin.<p><b>then he shall bear his iniquity.</b><br>This phrase indicates personal responsibility for sin and its consequences. In the Old Testament, bearing one's iniquity often meant facing the penalty for sin, which could include exclusion from the community or even death, depending on the severity of the transgression. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where individuals are accountable for their actions (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). Theologically, this points to the need for atonement and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the iniquity of humanity on the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).
