In the ancient Israelite context, offerings were a tangible expression of devotion and obedience to God. The act of bringing offerings with one's own hands signifies a direct and personal relationship with God, highlighting the importance of individual participation in religious practices. This personal involvement is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to present their bodies as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>he shall bring the fat,</b><br>The fat of the animal was considered the best part and was reserved for God, symbolizing the offering of the best to the Lord. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, fat was associated with abundance and prosperity. The requirement to offer the fat underscores the principle of giving God the first and best of what one has, a theme that runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>).<p><b>together with the breast,</b><br>The breast of the sacrificial animal was given to the priests as their portion (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>). This provision for the priests reflects the broader biblical principle of supporting those who minister in spiritual matters (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). The sharing of the breast also symbolizes fellowship and the communal aspect of worship, as the priests and the offerer partake in the sacrificial meal.<p><b>and wave the breast as a wave offering before the LORD.</b><br>The wave offering involved a specific ritual where the breast was moved back and forth before the altar. This act symbolized presenting the offering to God and then receiving it back as a gift. The wave offering signifies the acknowledgment of God's provision and the sanctification of the offering. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself to God and was raised for our justification (<a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>). The wave offering, therefore, points to the resurrection and the new life believers have in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the sacrifice, who is required to present the offering with his own hands, signifying personal involvement and dedication.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The recipient of the offerings, representing the divine presence and authority in the sacrificial system.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, priests play a crucial role in the sacrificial process, facilitating the offering and performing the wave offering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship where offerings are brought and presented before the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wave_offering.htm">Wave Offering</a></b><br>A specific type of offering where the breast of the sacrifice is waved before the LORD, symbolizing the presentation and dedication of the offering to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_involvement_in_worship.htm">Personal Involvement in Worship</a></b><br>The requirement for the offerer to bring the offering with his own hands underscores the importance of personal involvement in worship.

The manner in which this rite was performed in the time of Christ was as follows:--The offerer killed the sacrifice, and the priest sprinkled the blood. The victim was then flayed, and the officiating priest took out the inwards, cut the flesh into pieces, and separated the breast and the right shoulder. Whereupon he laid the fat first upon the owner's hands, then the breast, then the shoulder above it; the two kidneys and the caul of the liver above them again, and the bread above the whole, put his own hand under that of the offerer, and waved it all before the Lord. Hereupon the priest salted the inwards, and burned them upon the altar. The breast and right shoulder, as well as the bread waved before the Lord, were eaten by him and his brother priests, whilst the remainder of the flesh and the rest of the bread were eaten by the owner and his friends. If two persons brought a peace offering in partnership, one of them waved for both; and if a woman brought it, the waving was performed by the officiating priest, since women were not allowed to wave except in the offering of jealousy and of a Nazarite (<a href="/numbers/5-25.htm" title="Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar:">Numbers 5:25</a>;
