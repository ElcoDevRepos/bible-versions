The calculation of years since the sale was crucial to determine the redemption price. This reflects the importance of land in Israelite society, as it was tied to family inheritance and God's covenant with Israel. The concept of Jubilee emphasizes God's sovereignty over the land and His provision for economic reset and social justice. It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption found in Christ, who restores what is lost.<p><b>repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it</b><br>This repayment represents the redemption price, calculated based on the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee. The balance ensures fairness in transactions, reflecting God's justice and mercy. This principle of redemption is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ pays the ultimate price for humanity's redemption. The act of repaying the balance underscores the value of integrity and responsibility in financial dealings, aligning with biblical teachings on stewardship and honesty.<p><b>and return to his property</b><br>The return to one's property signifies restoration and the re-establishment of familial and tribal inheritance. This return is not just a physical reclaiming of land but also a spiritual renewal, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His promises. The Jubilee year serves as a reminder of God's provision and the hope of restoration, paralleling the eschatological hope of believers in the New Testament. The concept of returning to one's property can be seen as a type of the ultimate rest and restoration found in Christ, who promises an eternal inheritance to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelite_seller.htm">The Israelite Seller</a></b><br>An individual who has sold his property due to financial hardship and is seeking to redeem it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_buyer.htm">The Buyer</a></b><br>The person who purchased the property and is holding it until the original owner can redeem it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_year_of_jubilee.htm">The Year of Jubilee</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50 years, where properties are returned to their original families, and debts are forgiven.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_israel.htm">The Land of Israel</a></b><br>The geographical and spiritual setting where these laws are applied, emphasizing the land's divine ownership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws of Leviticus to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_redemption.htm">The Principle of Redemption</a></b><br>The concept of redemption in <a href="/leviticus/25-27.htm">Leviticus 25:27</a> highlights God's desire for restoration and the return to one's rightful place.

This was deducted from what he originally paid for the plot of land, and the difference was returned to him by the vendor, to whom the patrimony reverted. Thus, for instance, if there were thirty years from the time the purchase was effected to the year of jubile, and the vendor or his next of kin redeemed the inheritance either ten or fifteen years after the transaction, he had to return to the purchaser either one-third or half of the purchase money, when the soil was restored to the seller or his next of kin. In the interest of the purchaser, however, it was enacted during the second Temple that the redemption should not take place before he had the benefit of the field for two productive years (see <a href="/leviticus/25-15.htm" title="According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy of your neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to you:">Leviticus 25:15</a>), and that he could claim compensation for outlay on improvements.<span class= "bld"><p>Restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it.</span>--That is, an equitable estimate is to be made of what the land is likely to yield from the time of its redemption by the vendor to the jubile, which is to be allowed to the purchaser.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/25-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he shall calculate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;i&#353;&#183;&#353;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
