The Israelites were set apart from other nations, and this command underscores their distinct identity. The phrase "Say to the Israelites" is a common introduction in Leviticus, indicating divine instruction through Moses. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's society, where God directly communicated His laws to His people.<p><b>Of all the beasts of the earth</b><br>The term "beasts of the earth" refers to land animals, encompassing a wide variety of creatures. This phrase sets the stage for a detailed classification of animals, distinguishing between those that are clean and unclean. The categorization of animals is significant in the context of ancient Israel, as it reflects God's concern for holiness and purity. The earth, as God's creation, is filled with diverse life, and this commandment acknowledges the breadth of God's creation while setting boundaries for human consumption.<p><b>These ones you may eat</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of dietary laws, which are central to Levitical regulations. The permission to eat certain animals is not arbitrary but is based on criteria that God established. These dietary laws served multiple purposes: they were a means of maintaining ritual purity, promoting health, and distinguishing the Israelites from surrounding nations. The permission to eat specific animals is a reminder of God's provision and care for His people. In a broader theological context, these laws foreshadow the ultimate purity and holiness found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers spiritual nourishment to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God and communicated them to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Law to set them apart as holy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God gave Moses the Law, including dietary regulations, to guide the Israelites in their covenant relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>The dietary laws were given to set the Israelites apart as a holy nation.

He claims the whole animal kingdom yet graciously grants certain foods for Israel&#8217;s good, illustrating both His provision and His prerogative to set boundaries. For believers today, the specific dietary rules have found their completion in Christ, but the heart of the passage still calls us to respond to God&#8217;s voice with trusting obedience, living distinctly for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">These are the animals which ye may eat of all </span>. . . . The dietary laws, which stand first in the general precepts about clean and unclean things, begin with the quadrupeds, or land animals, both domesticated and wild. This is in accordance with the Hebrew division of the animal kingdom into four principal classes :--(1) the land animals, (2) the water animals, (3) the birds of the air, and (4) the swarming animals. ? Though not specified here by name, yet the parallel regulations in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-4.htm" title="These are the beasts which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,">Deuteronomy 14:4-5</a> enumerate the following ten animals :--the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hart, the roebuck, the fallow deer, the wild goat, the pygang, the wild ox, and the chamois, with their various kindred species, which are not mentioned. From the expression, "These are the animals," the opinion obtained during the second Temple that God actually caused specimens of every animal to pass before Moses and Aaron, in order to show them the veritable creatures which are clean and unclean, just as the Lord caused every species to come to Noah into the ark.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the beasts that ye shall eat.</span> In order that the Israelites might know how to avoid the uncleanness arising from the consumption of unclean flesh, plain rules are given them by which they may distinguish what flesh is clean and what is unclean. The first rule is that anything that dies of itself is unclean, whether it be beast, bird, or fish. The reasons of this are plain: for <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the flesh still retains the blood, which no Israelite might eat; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is something loathsome in the idea of eating such flesh. Next, as to beasts, a class is marked off as edible by two plainly discernible characteristics, and instances are given to show that where there is any doubt owing to the animals possessing one of the characteristic marks only, the rule is to be construed strictly. As to fish and insects, equally plain rules, one in each case, are laid down; but as birds are not readily distinguished into large classes, the names of those that are unclean are given one by one, the remainder being all of them permissible. Thus the simple Israelite would run no risk of incurring uncleanness by inadvertently eating unclean food, whether of beast, bird, fish, or insect. The object of the regulations being to exclude all meats naturally offensive to the human taste, all carnivorous quadrupeds are shut out by the rule of chewing the cud (verse 3), with the same purpose, birds of prey and birds that eat offal are prohibited (verses 13-19), and scaleless fish on account of their repulsive appearance (verses 9-12), as well as beetles, maggots, and vermin of all sorts. In the case of beasts and fish, the rules laid down to mark off those things that are offensive, being general in their application, are such as to include in the forbidden class some few which do not appear naturally loathsome. This is owing partly to the difficulty of classification, partly to a change of feeling which experience has wrought in the sentiments of mankind with regard to such edibles as swine's flesh and shell-fish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Say</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(dab&#183;b&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Of all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
