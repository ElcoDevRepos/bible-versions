This interaction occurs after the tragic death of Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, who offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. Aaron's response is significant as it reflects his role as a mediator between God and the people, and his deep understanding of the priestly duties and the gravity of the situation. This moment highlights the importance of obedience and reverence in worship, a theme that runs throughout Leviticus.<p><b>Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD</b><br>The sin offering and burnt offering were central to the sacrificial system established by God for Israel. The sin offering was meant to atone for unintentional sins, while the burnt offering symbolized complete dedication to God. Aaron emphasizes that these offerings were made "before the LORD," indicating their sacredness and the necessity of following divine instructions precisely. This phrase underscores the seriousness of worship and the need for purity and holiness in approaching God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>, which speaks of the necessity of blood for atonement.<p><b>Since these things have happened to me</b><br>Aaron refers to the death of his sons, a personal tragedy that also serves as a public lesson on the holiness required in the priesthood. This phrase reflects the human aspect of Aaron's role and the emotional weight of his responsibilities. It also points to the broader biblical theme of suffering and the testing of faith, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Job and Joseph. Aaron's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also suffered and bore the weight of sin, though without fault.<p><b>if I had eaten the sin offering today</b><br>According to Levitical law, the priests were to eat portions of certain offerings as part of the ritual process (<a href="/leviticus/6-26.htm">Leviticus 6:26</a>). Aaron's hesitation to eat the sin offering reflects his concern for maintaining ritual purity and his awareness of the spiritual state required to partake in such a sacred act. This moment foreshadows the New Testament understanding of communion, where believers are called to examine themselves before partaking in the Lord's Supper (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>).<p><b>would it have been acceptable in the sight of the LORD?</b><br>Aaron's rhetorical question highlights his deep reverence for God's holiness and his fear of offending the Lord through improper actions. This concern for acceptability before God is a recurring theme in scripture, emphasizing the need for a pure heart and right intentions in worship (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). It also points to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose offering was fully acceptable to God, providing eternal redemption for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.

Aaron, however, was fully sensible of this, and hence replies to the charge brought against his sons.<p><span class= "bld">They offered their sin offering.</span>--Before proceeding to the transgression with which they are thus charged, Aaron adverts to the fact that all the other sacrificial duties in which he and his sons were engaged on the same day, prior to the great calamity, were performed in strict accordance with the prescribed ritual. His sons assisting him had offered "their"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the people's--sin and burnt offerings (see <a href="/context/leviticus/9-15.htm" title="And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.">Leviticus 9:15-16</a>) thus far in due compliance with the requirements of the law, and hence could never have meant to transgress intentionally.<p><span class= "bld">And such things have befallen me.</span>--But whilst he, Eleazar, and Ithamar were thus duly performing the sacrificial rites, Nadab and Abihu, his other two sons, transgressed, and were suddenly struck down dead, thus overwhelming the survivors with sorrow, and rendering them unfit to partake of the sacrifices.<p><span class= "bld">And if I had eaten.</span>--Aaron submits that, unfitted as they thus were by mourning and the sense of their own sinfulness, if they had partaken of this solemn meal it would not have been acceptable to the Lord. In consequence of this declaration, the rule obtained during the second Temple, that when an ordinary priest heard of the death of a relative whilst on duty in the sanctuary, he had to cease from service, though he could not leave the precincts of the Temple otherwise he defiled the sacrifice;
