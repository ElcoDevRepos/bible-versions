The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. The priests were required to remain at the entrance to fulfill their duties and maintain the sanctity of the worship space. This command underscores the seriousness of their priestly responsibilities and the need for obedience to God's instructions. The Tent of Meeting was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and symbolized God's desire to dwell among His people, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is described as "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>or you will die</b><br>This severe warning highlights the holiness of God and the seriousness of approaching Him with reverence and obedience. The deaths of Nadab and Abihu, who offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience (<a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). The holiness required of the priests is a reflection of God's own holiness, and their role was to mediate between God and the people. This foreshadows the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>for the LORD&#8217;s anointing oil is on you.</b><br>The anointing oil was a symbol of consecration and the Holy Spirit's presence. It set the priests apart for their sacred duties and signified their special role in serving God and the community. The anointing oil's composition and use were strictly regulated (<a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>), emphasizing the sacredness of the priestly office. This anointing prefigures the anointing of Jesus by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>) and the anointing of believers with the Holy Spirit, marking them as God's chosen people (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a>).<p><b>So they did as Moses instructed.</b><br>This phrase indicates the obedience of Aaron and his sons to Moses' command, which was ultimately God's command. Their compliance demonstrates a recognition of the gravity of their roles and the importance of adhering to divine instructions. Moses, as the mediator of God's law, represents the authority of God's word, which the priests were to uphold. This obedience is a model for believers, who are called to live in accordance with God's word and the teachings of Christ (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
