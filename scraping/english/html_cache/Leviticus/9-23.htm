The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It was a portable sanctuary used during the wilderness wanderings. Moses and Aaron entering the Tent signifies their roles as mediators between God and the people. This act also underscores the importance of approaching God with reverence and obedience, as the Tent was where God communicated His will. The Tent of Meeting is a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and symbolizes the presence of God among His people, foreshadowing the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who is described as the true Tabernacle in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p><b>When they came out, they blessed the people,</b><br>The blessing of the people by Moses and Aaron signifies the completion of the sacrificial rituals and God's acceptance of the offerings. In the Old Testament, blessings were a way to convey God's favor and presence. This act of blessing is reminiscent of the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, which invokes God's protection, grace, and peace. The role of the priest as a mediator who blesses the people points to Jesus Christ, our High Priest, who blesses believers with spiritual blessings (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p><b>and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.</b><br>The appearance of the glory of the LORD is a theophany, a visible manifestation of God's presence. In the context of Leviticus, this event confirms God's acceptance of the sacrifices and His presence among the Israelites. The glory of the LORD often appeared as a cloud or fire, symbolizing His holiness and power (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>). This manifestation reassured the people of God's covenantal relationship with them. The glory of the LORD is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the radiance of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The presence of God's glory among the people foreshadows the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, as seen in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness.

Hence Aaron, conducted by Moses, left the court where the altar of burnt offering stood, and where the sacrifices had been offered, and went into the holy place where the altar of incense stood to perform this last act of the ritual. (See <a href="/exodus/30-7.htm" title="And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresses the lamps, he shall burn incense on it.">Exodus 30:7</a>, &c.) Having already delivered to Aaron the charge of all the things connected with the sacrifices in the court, Moses now also committed to him the care of the things within the sanctuary, showing him, at the same time, how to offer the incense, how to arrange the shewbread on the table, how to light and trim the lamps of the candlestick, &c., all of which were in the sanctuary. There can, however, hardly be any doubt that whilst there they prayed, as tradition informs us, for the promised manifestation of the Divine presence.<p><span class= "bld">And came out, and blessed the people.</span>--According to an ancient tradition embodied in the Chaldee Version of the Pentateuch, the blessing which Moses and Aaron unitedly bestowed upon the people on coming out of the sanctuary, was as follows :--"May the word of the Lord accept your sacrifice with favour, and remit and pardon your sins."<p><span class= "bld">And the glory of the Lord appeared.</span>--To show his gracious acceptance of the institution of the priesthood, and of the whole service connected therewith, God manifested himself in the more luminous appearance of the cloudy pillar. This glorious appearance which, in a lesser degree, always filled the tabernacle, was now visible in greater effulgence to all the people who witnessed the installation. (Comp. <a href="/exodus/16-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.">Exodus 16:10</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10-12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> (for the last time) and <span class="cmt_word">Aaron</span> (for the first time) went into the tabernacle in the character of priest. During this visit Moses committed to Aaron the care of the things within the tabernacle, as he had already given him the charge of all connected with the sacrifices of the court. Not till after this is Aaron fully initiated into his office. "No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>). On coming out from the tabernacle, Moses and Aaron, standing near the door, unite in blessing the congregation, in order to show the harmony between them and the capacity of blessing in the Name of the Lord enjoyed by Aaron as by Moses. The latter has now divested himself of that part of his office which made him the one mediator between God and his people, Aaron is henceforth a type of Christ as well as Moses. While giving the joint blessing, the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people, proceeding from the ark, and enveloping the lawgiver and the priest as they stood together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/9-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Aaron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
