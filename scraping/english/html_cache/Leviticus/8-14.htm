The bull, as a sin offering, represents atonement for sin, specifically for the priests in this instance. The act of bringing the bull near signifies the beginning of the ritual, emphasizing the need for purification before God. This offering is a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, as <a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm">Hebrews 10:4</a> indicates that the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins, pointing to the necessity of Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act of identification and transfer. By placing their hands on the bull's head, Aaron and his sons are identifying with the animal, symbolically transferring their sins onto it. This act signifies the substitutionary nature of the sacrifice, where the bull bears the penalty for their sins. This practice is a precursor to the concept of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), highlighting the substitutionary atonement found in Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.

Moses brings the bull, showing ordained leadership must submit to God&#8217;s order. The bull&#8217;s purpose underscores sin&#8217;s gravity and the necessity of blood atonement. Aaron and his sons, future mediators, humbly admit their own sinfulness, and by laying hands on the animal, they transfer guilt to a substitute. This literal event points forward to the perfect Priest and Sacrifice, Jesus Christ, who bears our sin so that we may serve God cleansed and accepted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And he brought the bullock for the sin offering</span>--Though duly consecrated, Aaron and his sons had first to be purged of their sins before they could commence their priestly functions in the sanctuary. Hence, Moses, as the mediator of the covenant delegated by God to perform the act of consecration, also performed the sacrificial rites, whilst the installed priests stood as penitent sinners by the side of the sin offering which was now offered for the first time. For the laying on of the hands by the offerer on the victim, see <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm" title="And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.">Leviticus 1:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-32.</span> - After the bathing, the robing, and the anointing, follow the sacrifices of consecration - the sin offering (verses 14-17), the burnt offering (verses 18-21), the peace offering (verses 22-32). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sin offering.</span> This was the first sin offering ever offered. There had been burnt offerings and sacrifices akin to peace offerings before, but no sin offerings. At once the sin offering takes its place as the first of the three sacrifices before the burnt offerings and peace offerings. Justification comes first, then sanctification, and, following upon them, communion with God.
