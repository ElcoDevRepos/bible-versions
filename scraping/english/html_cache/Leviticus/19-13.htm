In the ancient Near Eastern context, where community and familial ties were strong, defrauding a neighbor would have been a serious breach of trust. The Hebrew word for "defraud" implies deceit or trickery, suggesting that God values transparency and fairness. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches the Golden Rule (<a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>) and Paul instructs believers to owe nothing to anyone except love (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>). The prohibition against robbery underscores the sanctity of personal property, a concept rooted in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>).<p><b>You must not withhold until morning the wages due a hired hand.</b><br>In ancient Israel, day laborers were often poor and relied on daily wages for survival. Withholding wages would have caused immediate hardship, violating the principle of justice and compassion. This command reflects God's concern for the vulnerable and is reiterated in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>, which warns against oppressing hired workers. The New Testament reinforces this ethic, as James condemns the rich who withhold wages from laborers (<a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>). This principle also points to the character of Christ, who fulfills the law by embodying perfect justice and mercy. The timely payment of wages is a practical expression of love and respect for one's neighbor, aligning with the broader biblical theme of caring for the needy and oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The primary audience of the Levitical laws, called to live as God's holy people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>- Refers to fellow Israelites and, by extension, all people with whom one interacts.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_hand.htm">Hired Hand</a></b><br>- A worker who is employed for wages, often dependent on timely payment for daily sustenance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>- The place where God delivered the laws to Moses, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_business_practices.htm">Integrity in Business Practices</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to conduct our business dealings with honesty and fairness, reflecting God's character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/timeliness_and_justice.htm">Timeliness and Justice</a></b><br>Paying workers promptly is a matter of justice and respect for their dignity and needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_for_neighbor.htm">Love for Neighbor</a></b><br>Our treatment of others, including employees and those we owe, should be guided by love and compassion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_the_vulnerable.htm">God's Concern for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>God cares deeply for the vulnerable, including workers who rely on timely wages for their livelihood.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_holiness.htm">Reflecting God's Holiness</a></b><br>By adhering to these commands, we reflect God's holiness and righteousness in our daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_19_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 19:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_19_13_Fair_employee_treatment.htm">How does Leviticus 19:13 instruct us to treat our employees fairly today?

As he is dependent upon his wages for the support of himself and his family, the Law protects him by enjoining that the earnings of the hireling should be promptly paid. This benign care for the labourer, and the denunciation against any attempt to defraud him, are again and again repeated in the Scriptures (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/24-14.htm" title="You shall not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-13.htm" title="And I charged Baruch before them, saying,">Jeremiah 32:13</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm" title="And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href="/james/5-4.htm" title="Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.">James 5:4</a>).
