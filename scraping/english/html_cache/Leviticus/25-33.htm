Instead, they were given cities and surrounding pasturelands (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). This provision allowed them to redeem property, ensuring their sustenance and ability to serve in their priestly roles. The concept of redemption here reflects God's provision and care for those dedicated to His service, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>a house sold in a city they possess</b><br>The Levites were granted specific cities within the territories of other tribes. These cities were strategically located to allow the Levites to minister throughout Israel. The sale of a house within these cities was not permanent, highlighting the temporary nature of earthly possessions and the enduring nature of God's promises. This arrangement ensured that the Levites could continue their religious duties without being permanently dispossessed.<p><b>and must be released in the Jubilee</b><br>The Year of Jubilee, occurring every 50th year, was a time of liberation and restoration (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8-17</a>). It symbolized God's mercy and the resetting of social and economic structures. For the Levites, the Jubilee ensured that their properties would return to them, maintaining their ability to serve God and the community. This reflects the biblical theme of redemption and restoration, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Christ.<p><b>because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites</b><br>The Levites' possession of these houses was unique, as they did not own land like the other tribes. This arrangement underscored their special role and dependence on God and the community for their livelihood. It also served as a reminder to the Israelites of the Levites' spiritual leadership and the importance of supporting those who minister in God's name. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to support those who labor in teaching and preaching (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

It is, however, more than probable that the negative particle has dropped out of the text, and that the passage as it originally stood was, "And if one of the Levites doth not redeem it."
