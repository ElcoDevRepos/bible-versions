The guilt offering, or "asham," is a sacrifice for atonement of specific sins, particularly those involving restitution. Blood symbolizes life and is essential for atonement (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This offering underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for purification.<p><b>and put it on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed</b><br>The right side often symbolizes strength and favor in biblical texts. The application of blood to the earlobe signifies the cleansing of what the person hears, indicating a call to listen to God's commands. This act parallels the consecration of priests (<a href="/exodus/29-20.htm">Exodus 29:20</a>), suggesting that the cleansed person is set apart for God.<p><b>on the thumb of his right hand</b><br>The thumb represents action and work. By applying blood here, the ritual signifies the purification of the person's deeds and actions. This act is a call to righteous living, aligning one's work with God's will. It reflects the idea that believers are to serve God with their hands, as seen in the New Testament call to do everything for the glory of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p><b>and on the big toe of his right foot</b><br>The big toe is crucial for movement and balance, symbolizing the person's walk or way of life. The application of blood here indicates a cleansing of one's path, urging the individual to walk in God's ways. This act can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of walking in the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<br><br>This ritual, in its entirety, foreshadows the comprehensive cleansing and sanctification found in Jesus Christ.

The priest applies sacrificial blood to ear, thumb, and toe, literally purifying the leper and symbolically dedicating his hearing, working, and walking to the Lord. The ritual echoes priestly ordination and anticipates Christ&#8217;s atonement, teaching that forgiven people belong wholly to God&#8212;listening to His voice, serving with their hands, and walking in His ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And the priest shall take some of the</span> <span class= "bld">blood.</span>--During the second Temple two priests caught the blood of the trespass offering--one into a vessel, and the other into the hollow of his hand. The one who caught the blood in the vessel sprinkled it against the wall of the altar, whilst the other who had the blood in the hollow of his hand went to the convalescent, who was waiting in the porch of Nicanor opposite the eastern door, with his face turned to the west.<p><span class= "bld">And the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear.</span>--Still unable to enter the court of the sanctuary, because he had not as yet been cleansed, the restored leper put his head through the gate of Nicanor, when the priest who caught the blood in the hollow of his hand, and who stood within the court, close to the entrance, (because the blood of the expiatory sacrifices could not be brought beyond the limits of the court of Israel), put some of it on the cartilage of his right ear. He then put through his right hand, and the priest put some of the blood on his thumb; he then again put through his right foot, and the priest put some of the blood on the great toe. To expedite the process, the restored leper was also allowed to put through all the three members at once. If the cured leper had not a thumb on his right hand, or a toe on his right foot, or a right ear, he was never cleansed. The right members were chosen for these symbolical acts, as in the case of the consecration of the priest, because they are represented as the strongest, and are therefore the most able to execute the will of God, for which reason they were henceforth dedicated to His service. (See <a href="/leviticus/7-24.htm" title="And the fat of the beast that dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but you shall in no wise eat of it.">Leviticus 7:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed.</span> The Mishna describes the ceremony as follows: - "The leper stands before the trespass offering, lays his hand upon it and kills it. Two priests catch up the blood one in a vessel, the other in his band. He who catches it up in the vessel goes and throws it on the side of the altar, and he who catches it in his hand goes and stands before the leper. And the leper who had previously bathed in the court of the lepers, goes and stands in the gate of Nicanor. Rabbi Jehudah says he needs not bathe. He thrusts in his head (viz. into the great court, which he may not yet enter), and the priest puts of the blood upon the tip of his ear; he thrusts in his hand, and he puts it upon the thumb of his hand; he thrusts in his foot, and he puts it upon the great toe of his foot" ('Negaim,' 14:7, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 18.). No doubt, the ear, the thumb, and the great toe are selected for the purpose of showing, as in the case of the consecration of the priest, that the senses and the active powers of the restored Israelite must be dedicated hence, forth to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
