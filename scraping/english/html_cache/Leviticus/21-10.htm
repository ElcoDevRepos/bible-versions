The High Priest was responsible for entering the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to make atonement for the people. This role foreshadows Jesus Christ as our ultimate High Priest, who intercedes for us before God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>who has had the anointing oil poured on his head</b><br>The anointing oil symbolizes the consecration and setting apart of the High Priest for sacred duties. This act of anointing signifies the Holy Spirit's empowerment and presence, paralleling the anointing of Jesus by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).<p><b>and has been ordained to wear the priestly garments</b><br>The priestly garments, described in detail in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, were designed to reflect the glory and beauty of God. Each piece had symbolic meaning, such as the breastplate with twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. These garments set the High Priest apart, much like Christ's righteousness clothes believers (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>must not let his hair hang loose</b><br>This instruction signifies maintaining a state of holiness and order. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, disheveled hair was a sign of mourning or distress. The High Priest was to remain composed, reflecting the dignity and sanctity of his office, much like Christ's composed demeanor during His trials (<a href="/john/18-19.htm">John 18:19-23</a>).<p><b>or tear his garments</b><br>Tearing garments was a traditional expression of grief or anger in biblical times. The High Priest was prohibited from this act to maintain the sanctity and dignity of his role, even in times of personal loss. This restraint is mirrored in Christ's response to suffering, where He maintained His mission without succumbing to despair (<a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, the High Priest is the spiritual leader of Israel, set apart by God for special duties in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.
