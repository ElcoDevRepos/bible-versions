The use of olive oil in this ritual signifies anointing and consecration, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's presence and work. Olive oil was a common commodity in ancient Israel, used for cooking, lighting, and religious ceremonies. The "log" is a unit of measurement, approximately equivalent to about a third of a liter, indicating the specific amount required for the ritual. This act of taking the oil signifies preparation for a sacred act, emphasizing the importance of purity and holiness in worship.<p><b>pour it into his left palm</b><br>The act of pouring the oil into the left palm is significant in the ritualistic context. The left hand, often considered the weaker hand, may symbolize humility and submission, essential qualities for those serving in a priestly role. This action prepares the priest to apply the oil in the subsequent steps of the cleansing ritual. The use of the palm, a part of the body associated with work and action, underscores the active role of the priest in mediating God's grace and healing. This ritual act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, as our High Priest, mediates on our behalf, bringing spiritual cleansing and anointing through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest acts as a mediator between God and the people, performing rituals and sacrifices to maintain purity and holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/log_of_olive_oil.htm">Log of Olive Oil</a></b><br>A specific measure of oil used in purification rituals, symbolizing the Holy Spirit and anointing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/left_palm.htm">Left Palm</a></b><br>The priest's left palm is used as a vessel for the oil, signifying the personal involvement and sanctification process.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_oil.htm">Symbolism of Oil</a></b><br>Oil represents the Holy Spirit, anointing, and healing.

This is not only distinctly declared in the canons which obtained during the second Temple, but is expressed in the text, which is seen from the literal translation we have given of the clause in question. The same priest, however, was allowed to pour it into the palm of his own hands. To express this view, which the translators of the Authorised Version espoused, they omitted the word <span class= "ital">priest, </span>which is to be found in the original, and substituted <span class= "ital">his own, </span>which is not in the original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.</span> This ceremony is altogether peculiar to this purification. The joint use of blood and oil is not singular (see <a href="/leviticus/8-30.htm">Leviticus 8:30</a>), but elsewhere there is no <span class="cmt_word">sprinkling of the oil... seven times before the Lord,</span> and in the consecration of priests there was no anointing of the different members with oil as well as with blood. The Mishua (as before cited) continues the description of the ceremony as follows: - "The priest now takes from the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his colleague, though if he poured it into his own it were valid. He dips his finger and sprinkles seven times towards the holy of holies, dipping each time he sprinkles. He goes before the leper, and on the spot where he had put the blood he puts the oil, as it is written, 'Upon the blood of the trespass offering.' And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand, he pours on the head of him that is cleansed, for an atonement; if he so puts it, he is atoned for, but if not, he is not atoned for. So Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Jochanan, the son of Nuri, saith, This is only the remnant of the ordinance, whether it be done or not, the atonement is made; but they impute it to him (the priest), as if he had not made atonement." The double sprinkling with blood and oil betokened dedication as in the case of the priests, the blood specially denoting reconciliation, and the oil the strengthening power of God by which the new life was to be led. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/14-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
