This act signifies the complete removal of sin from the community, as the remains of the sacrificial animals are taken outside the camp, symbolizing the separation of sin from the people. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was crucified outside the city of Jerusalem, bearing the sins of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p><b>must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water</b><br>The requirement for washing and bathing emphasizes the need for purification after handling the sin offering. This ritual cleansing signifies the removal of impurity and the restoration of holiness. In the broader biblical context, water is often a symbol of purification and renewal, as seen in the practice of baptism in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The act of washing also reflects the importance of maintaining purity before reentering the community, highlighting the holiness required to approach God.<p><b>and afterward he may reenter the camp</b><br>Reentering the camp signifies the restoration of fellowship with the community and with God. The camp represents the dwelling place of God's people, and reentry indicates that the person is once again ceremonially clean and able to participate fully in the life of the community. This mirrors the spiritual restoration believers experience through Christ, who cleanses from sin and restores fellowship with God (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). The process underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement and purification before one can be in the presence of a holy God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_high_priest.htm">The High Priest</a></b><br>The high priest plays a central role in the Day of Atonement rituals, performing sacrifices and entering the Holy of Holies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scapegoat.htm">The Scapegoat</a></b><br>A goat that symbolically carries the sins of the people into the wilderness, representing the removal of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>Refers to the encampment of the Israelites, symbolizing the community of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_burns_the_offerings.htm">The One Who Burns the Offerings</a></b><br>This person is responsible for burning the remains of the sin offering outside the camp, highlighting the removal of impurity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_atonement.htm">The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)</a></b><br>An annual event where the high priest makes atonement for the sins of Israel, emphasizing purification and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_purification.htm">The Necessity of Purification</a></b><br>The requirement for the one who burns the offerings to wash and bathe underscores the importance of purity before re-entering the community.

Scripture repeatedly couples holy service with personal accountability (<a href="/leviticus/4-11.htm">Leviticus 4:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; This detail underlines that sin pollutes everything it contacts; the worker needs cleansing just as surely as the worshiper bringing the sacrifice.<p>&#8226; It also hints forward to Christ, &#8220;who also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people by His own blood&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). Jesus bore our uncleanness so we could stand clean.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes</b><p>&#8226; Garments in the Law often mirror the visible life of the believer. To wash them is to remove every trace of contamination (<a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm">Leviticus 11:25</a>; 14:8).<p>&#8226; God teaches that outward conduct matters. Even when the heart is right, sin&#8217;s residue can cling to actions, habits, and surroundings.<p>&#8226; Today we still &#8220;put off the old self&#8221; and &#8220;clothe ourselves with Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>; <a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>), aligning daily behavior with the holiness Christ provides.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bathe himself with water</b><p>&#8226; The cleansing moves from garments to the whole person. A full bath conveys total separation from impurity (<a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20-21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/15-5.htm">Leviticus 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Water symbolizes God&#8217;s ongoing provision for purity. The New Covenant echoes the same picture: we are washed &#8220;by the cleansing of the water through the word&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>) and &#8220;saved through the washing of rebirth&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the Day of Atonement bath is literal. God was teaching Israel that physical acts can preach spiritual truths&#8212;truths later fulfilled and deepened in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and afterward he may reenter the camp</b><p>&#8226; Only after cleansing could the worker return to Israel&#8217;s communal life (<a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>). Holiness was not optional; the entire camp was God&#8217;s dwelling place.<p>&#8226; The sequence&#8212;service, defilement, washing, return&#8212;mirrors the believer&#8217;s experience. We serve, we brush against a sinful world, and we must keep short accounts with God so fellowship stays unhindered (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7-9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Reentry anticipates our future: cleansed by Christ, we will one day enter the eternal camp, the &#8220;city whose architect and builder is God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/16-28.htm">Leviticus 16:28</a> teaches that even those engaged in God-ordained ministry must acknowledge sin&#8217;s defilement and submit to God&#8217;s prescribed cleansing. The required washing of clothes and body before reentering the camp underscores God&#8217;s uncompromising holiness, the seriousness of sin, and His gracious provision for restoration. Ultimately the verse points to Jesus, who bore our uncleanness outside the camp and now invites us, washed and clothed in His righteousness, to live in continual fellowship with Him and with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">And he that burneth.</span>--That is, those who carried the carcases and burned them, like the messenger who conducted the sin-laden goat, contracted defilement from the atoning victims.
