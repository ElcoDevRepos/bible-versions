The use of the right forefinger signifies precision and intentionality, as the right hand is traditionally associated with strength and skill. The oil represents the Holy Spirit, anointing, and consecration. The priest's act of dipping into the oil symbolizes the transfer of God's holiness and cleansing power to the individual. The left palm serves as a vessel, indicating the priest's role as an intermediary between God and the person being cleansed.<p><b>and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness and perfection, reflecting God's creation week. Sprinkling the oil seven times signifies a complete purification process, ensuring the person is fully restored to the community and to God. This act parallels the sprinkling of blood in other sacrificial rituals, emphasizing the necessity of both cleansing and atonement. The repetition underscores the thoroughness required in approaching God, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates that the ritual is performed in the presence of God, likely at the entrance of the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt among the Israelites. It underscores the importance of divine approval and the sacredness of the act. Performing the ritual before the LORD signifies that the cleansing is not merely physical but spiritual, restoring the individual's relationship with God.

After two birds are sacrificed outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2-7</a>) and after the healed person shaves and bathes (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>), the priest presents three animals at the sanctuary. Part of the blood from the guilt offering is placed on the healed person&#8217;s ear, thumb, and toe (<a href="/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>), and then &#8220;the priest shall take some of the log of oil&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/14-15.htm">Leviticus 14:15</a>). Verse 16 picks up with what the priest does next. These steps are as literal as they are symbolic&#8212;God really commanded them, and each act conveys His holiness and mercy (cf. <a href="/exodus/29-20.htm">Exodus 29:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Oil Poured Into the Priest&#8217;s Left Palm</b><p>&#8226; Oil in Scripture often pictures the Holy Spirit&#8217;s life-giving presence (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest uses his own hand as the vessel&#8212;reminding us that ministry flows through human servants, yet the source is divine.<p>&#8226; The left hand simply provides a stable basin; nothing random is in God&#8217;s directions (cf. <a href="/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a> where the right is distinguished from the left).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Dipping the Right Forefinger</b><p>&#8226; The priest&#8217;s &#8220;right forefinger&#8221; represents strength and precision.

Cleansing is a Godward act, not a mere social rehabilitation.<p>&#8226; God Himself witnesses and accepts the ritual, assuring the healed person of restored fellowship (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The location foreshadows the open access believers now have through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Symbol to Substance in Christ</b><p>&#8226; The blood-then-oil pattern anticipates the cross and Pentecost: Christ&#8217;s atoning death (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>) followed by the Spirit&#8217;s outpouring (<a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as the priest stood as mediator, Jesus mediates a better covenant, cleansing us from sin and filling us with the Spirit (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The number seven finds its ultimate fulfillment in the completeness of Christ&#8217;s salvation&#8212;&#8220;He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living the Truth Today</b><p>&#8226; Celebrate your literal cleansing: His blood has removed guilt; His Spirit now anoints you for service (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Approach worship deliberately, aware you stand &#8220;before the LORD&#8221; every moment (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Embrace completeness&#8212;stop rehearsing old uncleanness that God has already declared washed away (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Minister to others: the priest&#8217;s hands were involved; so are ours as we extend Christ&#8217;s cleansing truth to those still outside the camp (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/14-16.htm">Leviticus 14:16</a> records a literal step in the priestly cleansing of a healed leper: oil poured into the left palm, the right forefinger dipped, then sevenfold sprinkling before the LORD.
