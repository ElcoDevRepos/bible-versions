In the ancient Near Eastern context, such actions were considered a grave violation of family honor and social order. The phrase underscores the importance of respecting parental authority and maintaining the sanctity of the family unit. This commandment is part of a broader set of laws in Leviticus that aim to distinguish the Israelites from the surrounding nations, who often engaged in practices deemed immoral by biblical standards.<p><b>by having sexual relations with your mother.</b><br>The act of having sexual relations with one's mother is explicitly condemned here, highlighting the severity of incestuous relationships. In the cultural and historical context of the Israelites, family purity was paramount, and such actions were seen as defiling both the individual and the community. This prohibition is consistent with the broader biblical theme of sexual purity and the maintenance of clear boundaries within familial relationships. The law serves to protect the family structure, which is foundational to the covenant community.<p><b>She is your mother;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the natural and God-ordained role of the mother within the family. It serves as a reminder of the inherent respect and honor due to one's parents, as outlined in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The repetition of "your mother" reinforces the personal and relational aspect of the command, reminding the Israelites of the sacredness of the maternal role and the need to uphold family integrity.<p><b>you must not have sexual relations with her.</b><br>The repetition of the prohibition underscores its importance and the seriousness with which it is to be taken. This command is part of a larger framework of sexual ethics presented in Leviticus, which seeks to establish a community set apart for holiness. The prohibition against incest is reiterated in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>, and serves as a reminder of the call to live in accordance with God's design for human relationships. The emphasis on sexual purity can also be seen as a type pointing to the purity and holiness of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and calls His followers to a life of righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as a guide for holy living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people whose practices God wanted the Israelites to avoid.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ethical boundaries for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_structure.htm">Family Structure</a></b><br>The focus of this verse is on maintaining the sanctity and respect within the family unit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_family.htm">Sanctity of Family</a></b><br>The family is a sacred institution established by God, and maintaining its purity is crucial for societal stability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_parents.htm">Respect for Parents</a></b><br>Honoring parents is a fundamental biblical principle that extends beyond mere obedience to include respect for their roles and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/boundaries_in_relationships.htm">Boundaries in Relationships</a></b><br>God sets clear boundaries to protect individuals and families from the destructive consequences of sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_distinction.htm">Holiness and Distinction</a></b><br>As God's people, we are called to live distinctively, avoiding the practices of surrounding cultures that contradict God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Violating God's laws, especially in family matters, leads to personal and communal harm, emphasizing the need for adherence to His statutes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_18_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 18:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_18_7_Honor_family_boundaries.htm">How does Leviticus 18:7 emphasize the importance of honoring family boundaries today?

To &#8220;expose nakedness&#8221; is a polite way of saying &#8220;have sexual relations,&#8221; and here it stresses that no child is ever to intrude upon the exclusive intimacy God has established for husband and wife (see <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; By first mentioning the father, the text underscores that violating the mother also violates the father, because in marriage the two have become &#8220;one flesh&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Respect for parental authority is a cornerstone of God&#8217;s moral order (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>), and any act that shatters that respect undermines the family and society at large.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;by having sexual relations with your mother</b><p>&#8220; &#8230;by having sexual relations with your mother. &#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Incest between a child and parent is categorically forbidden. This command is not situation-specific but universal, rooted in God&#8217;s unchanging character (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Such a prohibition protects the family from emotional, spiritual, and physical harm. Scripture consistently portrays sexual purity as life-giving and sin as destructive (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse also distinguishes God&#8217;s people from the surrounding nations, whose pagan practices often ignored these boundaries (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a>)<p>&#8226; The repetition drives home the reality of the relationship. God appeals to the obvious&#8212;&#8220;She is your mother&#8221;&#8212;as sufficient reason to abstain.<p>&#8226; A mother is to be honored, cherished, and protected, never exploited (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; This final clause leaves no loophole. Any sexual act with one&#8217;s mother is condemned without exception, guarding the holiness God demands among His people (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a> condemns any sexual relationship between a child and a parent, affirming God&#8217;s design for marriage and the family. By forbidding the exposure of a father&#8217;s nakedness through the mother, the verse upholds parental honor, safeguards family purity, and sets God&#8217;s people apart from the corrupt practices of surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother.</span>--The rendering of the Authorised Version is based upon the interpretation which obtained during the second Temple, according to which this injunction is addressed both to the daughter and the son. The daughter must not marry or have commerce with the father, nor the son with the mother. Hence the Chaldee Version of Jonathan translates it "the woman shall not lie with her father, and the man shall not lie with his mother." Accordingly the case here contemplated is that of Lot's daughters (<a href="/context/genesis/19-31.htm" title="And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:">Genesis 19:31-38</a>). This passage may, however, be translated literally, <span class= "ital">the nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother shalt thou not uncover. </span>That is, they being both one flesh, the nakedness of the one is the nakedness of the other. Amongst the Persians and other eastern nations, marriage between son and mother was allowed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - Incest with a stepmother is placed next after that with a mother. On account of the unity caused by marriage ("they shall be one flesh," <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), the stepmother's nakedness <span class="cmt_word">is the father's nakedness</span>. The tie of affinity is thus declared to be similar in its effects to the tie of consanguinity. Reuben's sin, by which he forfeited his birthright, is connected with this offense, but is of a more heinous character, as his father was alive at the time of his transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). It is one of the sins which Ezekiel enumerates as those which brought the judgment of God on Israel (<a href="/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>). "That one should have his father's wife" is declared by St. Paul to be "such fornication as is not named among the Gentiles," and to call for the excommunication of the offender (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). Adonijah's marriage with Abishag, so strongly resented by Solomon on political grounds, is not denounced as morally reprehensible, probably because Abishag was not the wife of David in such a way as to cause the marriage with his son to be abominable in the eye of the law (cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a> with <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Absalom's" going in unto his father's concubines" was regarded as the final act which made reconciliation with his father impossible (<a href="/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a>). The history of the Church has shown that marriage with the stepmother has had to be again and again prohibited by Council after Council (see Smith and Cheetham's 'Dictionary of Antiquities,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> 'Prohibited Degrees'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">expose the nakedness</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1493;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;er&#183;wa&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6172.htm">Strong's 6172: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nakedness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
