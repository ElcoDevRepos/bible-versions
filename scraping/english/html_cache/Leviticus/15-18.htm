In the context of Leviticus, the focus is on ritual purity rather than moral judgment. The act itself is not sinful but requires purification due to the emission of bodily fluids, which were considered sources of impurity in the Levitical law. This reflects the broader biblical theme of distinguishing between the holy and the common, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>.<p><b>and there is an emission of semen,</b><br>The emission of semen is specifically mentioned as a cause of ritual impurity. In ancient Israel, bodily emissions were often associated with life and death, and thus with purity and impurity. This reflects the understanding that life is sacred and that the processes related to it, such as reproduction, require a state of cleanliness. This concept is echoed in other parts of Leviticus, such as in the laws concerning childbirth (Leviticus 12).<p><b>both must bathe with water,</b><br>The requirement to bathe with water signifies a ritual cleansing. Water is a common symbol of purification throughout the Bible, representing the removal of impurity and the restoration of a state of cleanliness. This practice prefigures the New Testament concept of baptism, which symbolizes spiritual cleansing and rebirth (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>, <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p><b>and they will remain unclean until evening.</b><br>The period of uncleanness lasting until evening indicates a temporary state of impurity. This reflects the cyclical nature of daily life and the renewal that comes with each new day. The evening marks the beginning of a new day in the Jewish calendar, symbolizing a fresh start and the restoration of purity. This concept of renewal is seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, where God's mercies are described as new every morning.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Leviticus were given, as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where purity laws were especially significant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/ritual_purity.htm">Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The state of being ceremonially clean, which was necessary for participation in worship and community life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time by which ritual impurity would end, marking a new day in the Hebrew calendar.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_ritual_purity.htm">Understanding Ritual Purity</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus highlight the importance of ritual purity in maintaining a relationship with God.

The verse therefore treats a common, God-given act while recognizing its ceremonial implications in Israel&#8217;s worship system.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is an emission of semen</b><p>The focus is the bodily fluid, considered ceremonially potent. Similar directives appear for nocturnal emissions (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-10.htm">Deuteronomy 23:10&#8211;11</a>) and for a woman&#8217;s monthly flow (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>).

By requiring a simple washing and a brief waiting period, God taught Israel that even good gifts must be approached with reverence. The regulations safeguarded the holiness of the camp and pointed forward to the greater cleansing provided by Jesus, who fulfills every shadow of the law and invites His people into continual, confident fellowship with the Holy One.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The woman also with whom man shall lie.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And if a man lie with a woman, </span>that is, even when what is specified in <a href="/leviticus/15-16.htm" title="And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:16</a> takes place in intercourse between man and woman lawfully married, it pollutes both the husband and the wife. They have accordingly both to immerse their whole bodies, and remain unclean till sundown, and were debarred from the privileges of the sanctuary during that day. Hence abstinence from conjugal intercourse was regarded as a necessary preparation for the performance of sacred duties. He who had approached his wife could not draw nigh to God (<a href="/exodus/19-15.htm" title="And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.">Exodus 19:15</a>), and was not allowed to partake of sacred meals. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1Samuel 21:5-6</a>.) The law of pollution was not designed to put a check upon marriage, since matrimony is a Divine institution (<a href="/context/genesis/1-27.htm" title="So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.">Genesis 1:27-28</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/2-21.htm" title="And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;">Genesis 2:21-25</a>), but it is intended to prevent husband and wife from making an immoderate use of their conjugal life, and thus to preserve them in health and vigour by prescribing such constant purifications after it. This is probably the reason why other nations of antiquity enacted similar laws. Thus the Hindoos and the Babylonians bathed after conjugal intercourse. The Egyptian priests abstained from it when they had to perform sacred duties, and the laity were not allowed to enter the precincts of the Temple unless they submitted to ablutions. Mahommed, for the same reason, enjoins lustrations upon all the faithful before reciting their prayers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The third case of an issue (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>;
