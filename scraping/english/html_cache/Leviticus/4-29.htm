It signifies identification with the sacrifice, acknowledging that the animal is taking the place of the sinner. This practice is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern customs where the laying on of hands was a gesture of blessing, commissioning, or transferring authority or guilt. In the broader biblical context, this act foreshadows the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity on the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>and slaughter it</b><br>The slaughtering of the animal represents the seriousness of sin and the necessity of bloodshed for atonement, as stated in <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar." This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb of God, whose death provides the final atonement for sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>at the place of the burnt offering</b><br>The location of the sacrifice is significant, as it is performed at the altar of burnt offering, which was situated in the courtyard of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple). This altar was central to Israelite worship and sacrificial practices, symbolizing the meeting place between God and man. The burnt offering, which was entirely consumed by fire, represents total dedication to God. The sin offering being slaughtered at this same place underscores the connection between atonement and consecration, pointing to the comprehensive work of Christ, who not only atones for sin but also sanctifies believers (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offerer.htm">The Offerer</a></b><br>The individual bringing the sin offering, representing the sinner seeking atonement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sin_offering.htm">The Sin Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial animal, typically a bull or goat, offered to atone for unintentional sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_burnt_offering.htm">The Altar of Burnt Offering</a></b><br>Located in the Tabernacle courtyard, where sacrifices were made to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The mediator who performs the sacrificial rites on behalf of the offerer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where sacrifices and worship were conducted.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The act of laying hands on the sin offering symbolizes the transfer of guilt and the need for atonement.

This personal act shows that sin is a personal violation of God&#8217;s holiness and cannot be dealt with at arm&#8217;s length (compare <a href="/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-10.htm">Exodus 29:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By laying his hand on the victim, the sinner identifies himself with it. The action visibly proclaims, &#8220;This animal now represents me before God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture stresses that this isn&#8217;t symbolic only; God accepts it as a real, God-ordained transfer of guilt (<a href="/numbers/8-10.htm">Numbers 8:10&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the head of the sin offering</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;sin offering&#8221; (so called in <a href="/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3, 14, 23, 29</a>) is God&#8217;s provision when someone misses the mark of His law unintentionally.<p>&#8226; Touching the head underscores substitution: the innocent stands in the place of the guilty, a picture ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;&#8220;God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; also <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is accurate and literal, we receive this transfer as an objective reality, not a ritualistic wish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and slaughter it</b><p>&#8226; The worshiper himself must kill the animal (<a href="/leviticus/4-33.htm">Leviticus 4:33</a>).

God prescribed one altar, one way, one place (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-6</a>). That unity foreshadows the one sacrifice of Christ, offered &#8220;outside the gate&#8221; yet accepted in heaven&#8217;s sanctuary (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The sinner sees that forgiveness is not a private transaction but part of the community&#8217;s worship; salvation binds the individual to the covenant people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/4-29.htm">Leviticus 4:29</a> teaches that the sinner personally transfers guilt to a substitute by laying his hand on the animal&#8217;s head, then takes responsibility for its death at God&#8217;s chosen altar. The verse highlights the personal nature of sin, the necessity of substitutionary bloodshed, and the integration of forgiveness with a life devoted to God. All of it points ahead to the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice of Jesus, who fulfills every detail and secures real, literal atonement for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29-31) <span class= "bld">And he shall</span> <span class= "bld">lay.</span>--The ritual prescribed in these verses is the same as that ordained in the case of the sin offering of the prince (<a href="/context/leviticus/4-24.htm" title="And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 4:24-26</a>).
