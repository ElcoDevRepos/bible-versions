The prohibition against incestuous relationships is rooted in the need to preserve the sanctity of the family unit, which is foundational to societal stability. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such relationships were often associated with pagan practices and were seen as defiling. The command reflects God's desire for His people to be set apart from surrounding nations, who may have engaged in such practices. This directive also underscores the importance of protecting the vulnerable, such as grandchildren, from exploitation and abuse. The broader biblical narrative consistently upholds the sanctity of family relationships, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, which establishes the marital bond as the primary sexual relationship.<p><b>for that would shame your family</b><br>The concept of shame in biblical times was deeply tied to one's social standing and community reputation. In a collectivist society, the actions of an individual could bring honor or disgrace to the entire family. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of sin, where personal actions have broader implications for the family and community. The shame associated with such acts would not only affect the immediate family but could also lead to social ostracism and a breakdown of familial trust. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has consequences that extend beyond the individual, affecting relationships and community harmony. The New Testament echoes this sentiment, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-2</a>, where the church is instructed to address sexual immorality to maintain the purity and witness of the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws in Leviticus were given as a guide for holy living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were headed, which was inhabited by people with practices that God deemed abominable.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/family.htm">Family</a></b><br>The central social unit in Israelite society, which these laws aim to protect and sanctify.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_family.htm">Sanctity of Family</a></b><br>The family is a sacred institution established by God.

From this prohibition it is inferred that a man must not marry his own daughter. If a granddaughter, who is a degree further removed from him, is proscribed, how much more his own daughter. Hence the canonical law during the second Temple deduced from this passage that "whoso companieth with a woman, even by way of fornication, and begetteth a daughter, she is forbidden to him." Still, when the mother is expressly forbidden to the son (see <a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm" title="The nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother, shall you not uncover: she is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:7</a>), it is strange that the daughter should have been passed over in silence, and be left to inference. It is therefore more than probable that a word has dropped out of the text, and that originally it stood here, "the nakedness of thy daughter and of thy son's daughter," &c. That this is not a solitary instance where the text has suffered from disarrangement we shall presently have occasion to see in <a href="/leviticus/18-11.htm" title="The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, begotten of your father, she is your sister, you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:11</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The fourth case of incest which is prohibited is that with a granddaughter, whether the daughter of son or daughter, for, as they are descended from the grandfather, <span class="cmt_word">their's</span> is <span class="cmt_word">thine own nakedness</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/18-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have sexual relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7713;al&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1540.htm">Strong's 1540: </a> </span><span class="str2">To denude, to exile, to reveal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your son&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bin&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
