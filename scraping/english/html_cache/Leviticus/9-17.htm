It symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God. This offering followed the sin and burnt offerings, indicating a progression from atonement to consecration. The grain offering was a voluntary act of worship, reflecting gratitude and acknowledgment of God's provision. It is reminiscent of the offering of firstfruits, which was a way to honor God with the first and best of one's produce.<p><b>took a handful of it</b><br>The priest taking a handful of the grain offering signifies the portion that was to be burned on the altar. This act represents the offering being set apart for God, with the remainder typically consumed by the priests. The handful symbolizes the offering of one's best and the dedication of one's work to God. This act of taking a portion for God is echoed in the New Testament principle of giving God the firstfruits of our labor and resources.<p><b>and burned it on the altar</b><br>Burning the offering on the altar signifies the complete dedication and surrender to God. The altar, a central element in the tabernacle, was the place where sacrifices were made to atone for sin and to worship God. The burning of the grain offering represents the transformation of the physical into the spiritual, as the smoke ascends to God. This act of burning is a type of Christ's sacrifice, where He offered Himself wholly to God for the atonement of humanity's sins.<p><b>in addition to the morning&#8217;s burnt offering</b><br>The morning burnt offering was a daily sacrifice, symbolizing continual atonement and dedication to God. The grain offering being added to this daily ritual highlights the importance of regular, ongoing worship and dedication. It underscores the idea that offerings to God are not isolated events but part of a continual relationship with Him. This practice points to the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, as part of their spiritual worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest who is performing the offerings as instructed by God through Moses.

Once the sin offering (v.15) and burnt offering (v.16) have dealt with guilt, Aaron moves on to the grain offering. This offering, described in detail in <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>, is a gift of fine flour mixed with oil and frankincense&#8212;a tangible expression of gratitude and devotion rather than atonement for sin. By presenting it &#8220;next,&#8221; Aaron follows the order God prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/6-14.htm">Leviticus 6:14-18</a>, underscoring that fellowship with a holy God must rest on a foundation of cleansed sin. <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-6</a> later shows that grain offerings ordinarily accompany regular burnt offerings, confirming that what Aaron does here inaugurates a lasting pattern for Israel&#8217;s worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Took a handful of it</b><p>The priest is instructed to take &#8220;a handful&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>), called the memorial portion. Physically small, it nevertheless represents the entire offering&#8212;much like a down payment guarantees the whole purchase (cf. <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a> on firstfruits). By limiting what is burned to a single handful, God graciously provides for the priestly family, who eat the remainder in a holy place (<a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16-18</a>). The act reminds worshipers that God values heartfelt dedication over quantity (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>). Aaron&#8217;s literal handful teaches that a sincere token, given in obedience, honors the Lord and invites His blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And burned it on the altar</b><p>Fire on the altar consumes the memorial portion, sending its aroma heavenward &#8220;as a pleasing fragrance to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>). The altar&#8212;already lit by divine fire in <a href="/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>&#8212;shows that God Himself initiates and sustains atonement and fellowship. Burning the grain symbolizes complete surrender: ordinary flour is transformed into smoke that rises to God, picturing life offered in worship (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>). Because Scripture records the event as factual history, we can trust that God truly accepted Aaron&#8217;s obedience and manifested His glory to all Israel (<a href="/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to the morning&#8217;s burnt offering</b><p>Every day began with a continual burnt offering (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>)&#8212;a lamb placed on the altar at dawn, kept burning through the day. Aaron&#8217;s grain offering doesn&#8217;t replace that daily sacrifice; it enhances it. The phrase &#8220;in addition to&#8221; reminds us that special moments of worship never negate regular devotion. Israel&#8217;s later priests kept this rhythm (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>), and believers today are called to do likewise: maintain daily communion with God while also seizing unique opportunities for deeper consecration (<a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>; <a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9-10</a>). The text highlights God&#8217;s desire for consistent, layered worship&#8212;ordinary faithfulness supplemented by dedicated acts of gratitude.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a> shows Aaron, newly ordained, following God&#8217;s exact instructions: he brings the grain offering, lifts a representative handful, burns it on the divinely kindled altar, and does so alongside the standing daily burnt offering. The verse teaches that forgiven people express thankful devotion, that even a modest handful given in obedience is precious, and that special offerings build on&#8212;not replace&#8212;steady, everyday worship. By recording these details, Scripture assures us that God welcomes wholehearted surrender and delights to meet His people in obedient, grateful praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And he brought the meat offering.</span>--This Aaron offered according to the rule in <a href="/context/leviticus/2-1.htm" title="And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:">Leviticus 2:1-3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span>--That is, in addition to the lamb which was daily offered as a burnt sacrifice, and was accompanied by a meat offering (<a href="/exodus/29-30.htm" title="And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he comes into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/29-40.htm" title="And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.">Exodus 29:40</a>).
