The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship for the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It symbolized God's presence among His people. Remaining at the entrance signifies a period of dedication and separation unto God, emphasizing the seriousness of their priestly duties.<p><b>day and night for seven days</b><br>The seven-day period reflects the completeness and perfection often associated with the number seven in the Bible. This time frame allowed for a full consecration process, mirroring the creation week where God established order. It also foreshadows the complete and perfect work of Christ, who fulfills the role of the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>and keep the LORD&#8217;s charge</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. The priests were to adhere strictly to the instructions given by God, highlighting the holiness required in their service. This obedience is a precursor to the New Testament teaching where believers are called to live according to God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>.<p><b>so that you will not die</b><br>The severity of the command indicates the holiness of God and the serious nature of approaching Him. The priests' lives depended on their adherence to God's instructions, illustrating the concept of divine justice. This is echoed in the New Testament, where the wages of sin is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), but through Christ, believers receive life.<p><b>for this is what I have been commanded.&#8221;</b><br>Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, relays God's direct command.
