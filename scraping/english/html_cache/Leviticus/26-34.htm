This command was part of the covenant between God and Israel, emphasizing the importance of rest and trust in God's provision. The land's enjoyment of its Sabbaths indicates a return to the intended order, highlighting the consequences of Israel's disobedience in not observing these Sabbaths.<p><b>all the days it lies desolate</b><br>The desolation of the land is a direct result of Israel's disobedience and subsequent exile. This desolation serves as a physical manifestation of the broken covenant. Historically, the Babylonian exile fulfilled this prophecy, as the land lay desolate for 70 years (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), allowing it to "catch up" on the missed Sabbaths. This period of desolation underscores the seriousness of covenantal faithfulness and the consequences of neglecting God's commands.<p><b>while you are in the land of your enemies</b><br>This phrase indicates the exile of the Israelites, a punishment for their persistent idolatry and failure to keep God's laws. Being in the land of their enemies signifies both physical displacement and spiritual separation from God's presence in the Promised Land. This exile serves as a reminder of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and highlights the need for repentance and return to God.<p><b>At that time the land will rest</b><br>The rest of the land during the Israelites' exile is a fulfillment of God's promise and a demonstration of His sovereignty over creation. This rest is not just a cessation of agricultural activity but a restoration of the land's intended purpose. It reflects the broader biblical theme of rest, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who offers spiritual rest to believers (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>and enjoy its Sabbaths</b><br>The repetition of the land enjoying its Sabbaths emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also serves as a prophetic reminder of the ultimate rest that believers will experience in the new creation, where God's people will dwell in perfect harmony with Him and His creation. This future rest is foreshadowed in the land's temporary rest during the exile and points to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are being addressed in this passage.

Israel was to farm six years and let the land rest in the seventh.<p>- By saying &#8220;the land shall enjoy,&#8221; the Lord underscores that the ground itself belongs to Him (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>) and has rights He will protect even when His people disregard them.<p>- The phrase anticipates a literal enforcement of those missed Sabbaths.

After discipline and return, God promises to &#8220;make the land fruitful&#8221; again (<a href="/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8-11</a>).<p>- Hope points forward: the ultimate Sabbath rest yet to come for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> assures that God will secure His land&#8217;s Sabbath rest, even if it means removing His people to foreign soil. The missed Sabbath years add up; the exile pays the debt. Yet the same verse hints at mercy: the land&#8217;s rest sets the stage for Israel&#8217;s eventual return. In judgment God proves faithful to His word, keeps His calendar, and preserves hope for restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths.</span>--The land, which participates both in the happiness and misery of the Israelites (see <a href="/leviticus/18-25.htm" title="And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof on it, and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants.">Leviticus 18:25</a>), and which through their disobedience of the Divine laws would be deprived of her sabbatical rests as long as the rebellious people occupy it, would now at last be able to enjoy its prescribed legal rest, when it is ridden of these defiant transgressors, and as long as they remain in exile.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34, 35.</span> - The land had not participated in the sins of its inhabitants. The latter had thought that, by the neglect of the sabbatical years, they had enriched themselves by the fruits of those years which would otherwise have been wasted. The result was that they lost the land altogether for a period equal to that during which it ought to have kept sabbath, and the land "as long as she lay desolate kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). From the entrance into the holy land until the Babylonish Captivity there elapsed eight hundred and sixty-three years, in which time there ought to have been kept one hundred and twenty-three sabbatical years. As only seventy are made up by the duration of the Captivity, it may be concluded that fifty-three sabbatical years were observed by the Israelites; but this conclusion is very doubtful. It is more likely that seventy, being a multiple of the sacred number seven, was regarded as sufficient to purge all previous neglects, whatever they might have been. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/26-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
