It typically consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense. This offering symbolized the dedication of one's labor and sustenance to God, acknowledging His provision. It was a non-blood offering, emphasizing thanksgiving and devotion rather than atonement for sin.<p><b>whether dry or mixed with oil</b><br>The grain offering could be presented in different forms: either as dry flour or mixed with oil. The use of oil, often olive oil, was significant in ancient Israelite culture, symbolizing richness, joy, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. The option for the offering to be dry or mixed with oil allowed for flexibility in worship, accommodating different economic situations of the offerers.<p><b>belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron</b><br>The sons of Aaron, the priestly family, were responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals. This phrase indicates that the grain offerings were distributed among the priests, providing for their sustenance as they served in the tabernacle. This provision underscores the communal aspect of worship and the support of those who minister before God. It also reflects the principle of sharing and equality among the priests, ensuring that all who served were cared for, regardless of their specific duties. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching on the support of those who preach the gospel (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_aaron.htm">Sons of Aaron</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses, who were appointed as priests in the service of the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

A grain offering (see <a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1&#8211;3</a>) was an act of worship that honored the Lord with everyday produce. Nothing about it involved blood, yet it was still &#8220;a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). By drawing attention to &#8220;every&#8221; grain offering, the verse reminds us that no one presentation is insignificant. Whether a worshiper brought a simple handful of flour (<a href="/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4</a>) or a larger baked loaf (<a href="/leviticus/2-4.htm">Leviticus 2:4</a>), God valued each act of obedience. Such inclusiveness reflects His character, who &#8220;does not show partiality&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>) and who desires that every gift, large or small, be received with equal seriousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whether dry or mixed with oil</b><p>Grain offerings came in two main forms:<p>&#8226; Dry&#8212;parched grain or fine flour without additional moisture (<a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Mixed with oil&#8212;kneaded dough, or flour blended with olive oil before being baked or fried (<a href="/leviticus/2-5.htm">Leviticus 2:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>Both versions symbolized dependence on God for daily bread. Oil enhanced flavor and cost more, yet God accepted either. This parallels His approval of both the widow&#8217;s two small coins (<a href="/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1&#8211;4</a>) and Barnabas&#8217;s generous field sale (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36&#8211;37</a>). The unchanging principle is wholehearted devotion. <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a> warns against favoritism; <a href="/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a> shows that God did not favor the wealthier worshiper who could afford oil over the poorer one who could not.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron</b><p>Here the focus shifts from the giver to the receiver&#8212;the priestly family. The portion of grain not burned on the altar &#8220;belongs equally&#8221; to every Aaronic priest (compare <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8&#8211;9</a>). By mandating equal distribution:<p>&#8226; God protected younger or less prominent priests from being overlooked (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; He curbed any tendency toward greed or favoritism, a failing later seen in Eli&#8217;s sons who &#8220;treated the offering of the LORD with contempt&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; He foreshadowed New Testament principles that &#8220;those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>The phrase also underscores family unity. Every priest shared one source of provision, reflecting their joint calling and pointing to the church&#8217;s shared inheritance in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5, 9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a> shows God&#8217;s fairness: every grain offering, whether humble or elaborate, is precious to Him, and the benefit of that offering must be divided evenly among His appointed servants. The verse highlights wholehearted worship, impartial acceptance, and equitable provision&#8212;timeless truths that encourage believers to honor God with whatever they have and to care for those called to minister in His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And every meat offering . . . and dry.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">but every meat offering </span>. . . <span class= "ital">or dry. </span>The only exception to the foregoing rule is the raw flour offering.
