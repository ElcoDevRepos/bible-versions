Moses, as the prophet and leader, is instructing Aaron and his sons, who are being consecrated as priests. This reflects the hierarchical structure established by God, where Moses acts as the intermediary to communicate divine instructions. The priesthood of Aaron and his sons is a type of the priesthood of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest.<p><b>Boil the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. Boiling the meat at the entrance signifies the sanctity and communal aspect of the ordination ceremony. The act of boiling, rather than roasting, may symbolize purification and preparation. This location underscores the importance of the Tabernacle as the focal point of Israelite worship and the presence of God.<p><b>and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings</b><br>Eating the meat and bread at the Tabernacle signifies participation in the holy offerings and the acceptance of the priestly role. The bread in the basket of ordination offerings is part of the ritual that sets apart Aaron and his sons for service. This meal is a covenantal act, similar to the fellowship offerings, and foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus institutes the New Covenant.<p><b>as I commanded, saying, &#8216;Aaron and his sons are to eat it.&#8217;</b><br>This command emphasizes obedience to God's instructions as delivered through Moses. The consumption of the offerings by Aaron and his sons is a necessary part of their consecration, symbolizing their full dedication to God&#8217;s service. It reflects the importance of following divine commands precisely, a theme prevalent throughout Leviticus. This obedience is a precursor to the perfect obedience of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and God's chosen prophet who is responsible for conveying God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel, representing the people before God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who are also appointed as priests, serving alongside their father in the priestly duties.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the priests, serving as the center of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/ordination_offerings.htm">Ordination Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made during the consecration of Aaron and his sons, symbolizing their dedication and sanctification for priestly service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The detailed instructions given to Moses, Aaron, and his sons highlight the importance of obedience in worship and service to God.
