In the ancient Near Eastern context, eating such meat was considered unclean due to the potential for disease and the lack of ritual slaughter. This reflects the broader Levitical concern for holiness and purity, distinguishing Israel from surrounding nations.<p><b>must wash his clothes</b><br>Washing clothes symbolizes purification and the removal of impurity. In biblical times, washing was a physical act that represented spiritual cleansing. This requirement underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity and the separation from defilement, which is a recurring theme in Leviticus.<p><b>and will be unclean until evening</b><br>The state of uncleanness was temporary, lasting until evening, which marked the end of the day in the Hebrew calendar. This period allowed for reflection and the restoration of purity. The concept of evening as a time of renewal is seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where each day is marked by "evening and morning."<p><b>and anyone who picks up the carcass</b><br>Handling a carcass, even without consuming it, also resulted in uncleanness. This highlights the pervasive nature of impurity and the need for vigilance in maintaining holiness. The act of touching a dead body is consistently associated with uncleanness in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>.<p><b>must wash his clothes</b><br>Reiterating the need for washing emphasizes the seriousness of maintaining ritual purity. This act served as a constant reminder of the Israelites' covenant relationship with God and their call to be a holy nation, as stated in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>.<p><b>and will be unclean until evening</b><br>The repetition of this phrase reinforces the temporary nature of uncleanness and the opportunity for restoration. It also points to the mercy and grace inherent in the law, allowing for purification and return to the community. This concept of cleansing and renewal is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live in purity through Christ's atoning work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The primary human author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including dietary and cleanliness laws, as part of their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law, emphasizing their journey and dependence on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/clean_and_unclean.htm">Clean and Unclean</a></b><br>A central theme in Leviticus, distinguishing between what is holy and common, pure and impure.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/carcass.htm">Carcass</a></b><br>Refers to the dead body of an animal, which, if touched or consumed, rendered a person ceremonially unclean.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_holiness.htm">Understanding Holiness</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus emphasize God's holiness and the call for His people to be set apart.

Consuming a found carcass blurs the line between life and death&#8212;a line He draws sharply throughout Scripture (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning presses Israel to rely on God-provided meat (sacrificial or hunted, properly bled) rather than whatever is easiest to grab. That dependence cultivates gratitude and obedience (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;must wash his clothes&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; External washing signified inner recognition of defilement. Similar directions appear in <a href="/leviticus/11-25.htm">Leviticus 11:25 and 17</a>:15, tying physical cleansing to spiritual awareness.<p>&#8226; Clothes touch everything we touch; washing them teaches that sin&#8217;s reach is broader than we first imagine (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This act prefigures the fuller cleansing Christ provides: &#8220;let us draw near&#8230;having our bodies washed with pure water&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>) and &#8220;the blood of Jesus&#8230;cleanses us from all sin&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will be unclean until evening</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and he will be unclean until evening.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Uncleanness was temporary yet real.

God ties impurity to proximity, not just participation.<p>&#8226; This anticipates New-Covenant cautions: &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) and &#8220;touch no unclean thing&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The standard is consistent: the holiness God seeks is comprehensive, affecting what we consume and what we carry (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes and will be unclean until evening</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase repeats to underline that God shows no partiality&#8212;eaters and handlers alike need cleansing (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition also reinforces memory; Israel heard these words countless times, engraving holiness on daily life (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it reminds us that repentance and practical separation from sin are not optional extras but integral responses to grace (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a> teaches that contact with death&#8212;through eating or even handling a carcass&#8212;renders a person ceremonially unclean, requiring washing and a period of separation until evening. The statute protected Israel physically, highlighted God&#8217;s revulsion toward death and decay, and foreshadowed the perfect cleansing later provided in Christ. Its enduring voice calls us to take sin seriously, pursue thorough cleansing, and live distinct, holy lives in grateful obedience to the God who makes us clean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">And he that eateth.</span>--That is, ignorantly, since for wilful transgression the transgressor incurred the penalty of excision.
