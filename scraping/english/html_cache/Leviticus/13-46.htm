The infection mentioned here is likely a skin disease, often translated as leprosy, though it could refer to a variety of skin conditions. The concept of uncleanness is central to the Levitical laws, which were given to the Israelites to maintain holiness and purity in their community. This reflects the holiness of God and the need for His people to be set apart. The state of being unclean required separation from the community to prevent the spread of physical and spiritual impurity. This separation also served as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for purification. In the New Testament, Jesus heals lepers, symbolizing His power to cleanse not only physical ailments but also spiritual uncleanness (<a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>).<p><b>He must live alone in a place outside the camp.</b><br>The requirement for the infected person to live alone outside the camp underscores the seriousness with which the Israelites were to treat issues of purity and holiness. The camp represented the dwelling place of God's people, and by extension, the presence of God Himself. To be outside the camp was to be separated from the community and the presence of God, highlighting the gravity of uncleanness. This separation also served a practical purpose in preventing the spread of disease. Historically, this practice reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of community health and purity. Theologically, it points to the separation sin causes between humanity and God. In <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>, Jesus is described as suffering outside the gate, drawing a parallel to the leper's isolation and emphasizing His role in bearing the sin and uncleanness of humanity to restore us to fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_infected_person.htm">The Infected Person</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who has been diagnosed with a skin disease, often translated as "leprosy" in older versions, but it could include a variety of skin conditions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, the camp refers to the community of Israelites as they journeyed through the wilderness.

These requirements protect the community, preserve the holiness of corporate worship, and illustrate the separating power of sin. At the same time, the passage points forward to Christ, who bore our uncleanness outside the camp so we might be cleansed and restored to full fellowship with God and His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(46) <span class= "bld">He shall dwell alone.</span>--In consequence of his extreme defilement, the leper had to live in seclusion outside the camp or city (<a href="/context/numbers/5-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 5:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/numbers/13-10.htm" title="Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.">Numbers 13:10-15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm" title="And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?">2Kings 7:3</a>, &c.). According to the legislation during the second Temple, if he stood under a tree and a clean person happened to pass by, he defiled the passer by. In the synagogue which he wished to attend they were obliged to make him a separate compartment, ten handbreadths high and four cubits long and broad. He had to be the first to go in and the last to leave the synagogue. Hence, leprosy was regarded as a living death, and as an awful punishment from the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/5-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? why consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.">2Kings 5:7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-20.htm" title="And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yes, himself hurried also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.">2Chronicles 26:20</a>), which they invoked upon all their mortal enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/3-29.htm" title="Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.">2Samuel 3:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-27.htm" title="The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall stick to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.">2Kings 5:27</a>). The leper was debarred from conjugal intercourse. These ancient Rabbinic laws were imported into the Christian Church during the Middle Ages. When any one was afflicted with this distemper, the priest, wearing his stole and holding the crucifix, conducted him into the church, where the leper had to exchange his clothes for a peculiar black garment, and the mass was read over him and the service for the dead. He was then taken to a sequestered house, where earth was thrown upon his feet as a sign of burial, and was admonished never to appear otherwise than in his black garment and barefooted. He was not allowed to enter a church, or any place where there was a mill or bread was baked, or come near a well or fountain. He forfeited both the right of inheritance and of disposing of his property, for he was considered a dead man. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/13-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">long as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has the infection,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ne&#183;&#7713;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
