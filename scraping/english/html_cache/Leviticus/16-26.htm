The term "scapegoat" comes from the Hebrew word "Azazel," which has been interpreted in various ways, including as a name for a demon or a desolate place. The scapegoat ritual is part of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) ceremonies, where one goat is sacrificed, and the other is sent away, symbolically carrying the sins of the people. This act prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity.<p><b>must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water</b><br>The requirement for the man to wash his clothes and bathe signifies purification. In the ancient Near Eastern context, washing was a common ritual for cleansing from defilement. This act underscores the holiness required to approach God and the need for purification after handling something associated with sin. It reflects the broader biblical theme of cleansing, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, where David asks to be washed and made whiter than snow.<p><b>afterward he may reenter the camp</b><br>Reentering the camp signifies restoration to the community after performing a task associated with sin and impurity. The camp represents the dwelling place of God's people, and reentry symbolizes acceptance and reintegration. This mirrors the New Testament concept of reconciliation with God and the community through Christ's atoning work, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>, where believers are reconciled to God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scapegoat.htm">The Scapegoat</a></b><br>In the Day of Atonement ritual, one goat is chosen by lot to be the scapegoat, symbolically bearing the sins of the people and being sent into the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_releases_the_goat.htm">The Man Who Releases the Goat</a></b><br>This individual is responsible for leading the scapegoat into the wilderness, away from the camp, symbolizing the removal of sin from the community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>Represents the dwelling place of the Israelites, where God's presence resides among His people.

One was sacrificed; the other&#8212;&#8220;the scapegoat&#8221;&#8212;was led into the wilderness, symbolically bearing Israel&#8217;s sins &#8220;to a solitary place&#8221; (v. 22).<p>- The unnamed &#8220;man&#8221; had a sacred task: physically removing sin from the camp. His anonymity reminds us that the focus is on God&#8217;s provision, not human prestige.<p>- Cross references: <a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21-22</a> shows the sins placed on the goat; <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> foretells the Lord laying our iniquity on His Servant; <a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a> points to Jesus suffering &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; for our cleansing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must wash his clothes</b><p>- Garments in Scripture often picture one&#8217;s outward condition before God. After handling the sin-laden goat, the man&#8217;s clothes were deemed ceremonially defiled.<p>- Washing pictured removal of contamination, not mere hygiene (<a href="/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7</a>).<p>- This outward act signified an inward reality&#8212;that sin demands cleansing before restored fellowship. Compare <a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>, &#8220;Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and bathe himself with water</b><p>- Total bathing underlined complete purification (<a href="/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a> when priests were consecrated; <a href="/leviticus/15-13.htm">Leviticus 15:13</a> for bodily discharges).<p>- Water imagery looks ahead to the cleansing accomplished by Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>) and the believer&#8217;s baptismal identification with Him (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>).<p>- The literal water removed ritual uncleanness; the greater application points to Christ&#8217;s blood that &#8220;purifies us from all sin&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>afterward he may reenter the camp</b><p>- Only after washing could the man return to normal community life, highlighting God&#8217;s holiness within the camp (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>).<p>- The sequence&#8212;atonement, cleansing, restored fellowship&#8212;mirrors the gospel pattern: Christ bears sin, believers are cleansed, fellowship with God is enjoyed (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: dealing with sin is not optional; cleansing precedes communion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/16-26.htm">Leviticus 16:26</a> underscores God&#8217;s unchanging demand for holiness and His gracious provision to meet it. The scapegoat carried Israel&#8217;s sins away; the handler&#8217;s required washing showed that contact with sin still defiles and must be cleansed before rejoining God&#8217;s people. Ultimately this ritual foreshadows Jesus, who bore our sins outside the camp and provides the true, final cleansing that brings us into unhindered fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he that leadeth away the goat to ?zazel </span>(see <a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm" title="But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.">Leviticus 16:10</a>). As the messenger who conducted the sin-laden animal to the author of sin contracted defilement by the impurity which the victim carried away, he had both to wash his clothes and immerse his whole body in water before he was admitted into the camp.
