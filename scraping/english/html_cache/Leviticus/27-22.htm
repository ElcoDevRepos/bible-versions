In Leviticus, this often pertains to offerings or vows made to God. The act of consecrating a field signifies a voluntary dedication, reflecting the individual's devotion and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over all possessions. This practice is rooted in the broader Levitical laws that emphasize holiness and dedication to God.<p><b>a field he has purchased,</b><br>The mention of a purchased field indicates that the field was not part of the man's ancestral inheritance. In ancient Israel, land ownership was typically tied to family lineage and tribal allotments, as seen in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes (Joshua 13-21). Purchasing a field would have been a significant investment, suggesting the man's willingness to dedicate something valuable to God. This reflects the principle that offerings to God should be meaningful and sacrificial.<p><b>which is not a part of his own property,</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between inherited land and acquired land. In Israelite society, inherited land was considered a perpetual family possession, as seen in the Year of Jubilee laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>), which ensured that land would eventually return to the original family. By consecrating a purchased field, the man is offering something that does not have the same familial ties, emphasizing the voluntary nature of his vow. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though not bound by earthly inheritance, offered Himself wholly to God for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, representing God, to whom the field is consecrated.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_man.htm">A Man</a></b><br>The individual who is making the vow or consecration of the field to the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/field.htm">Field</a></b><br>The piece of land being consecrated, which is significant as it is not originally part of the man's inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purchased_property.htm">Purchased Property</a></b><br>Indicates that the field was bought and not part of the man's ancestral land, highlighting the importance of ownership and stewardship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecration.htm">Consecration</a></b><br>The act of dedicating something to the LORD, which in this context involves a field that was purchased.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_consecration.htm">Understanding Consecration</a></b><br>Consecration involves setting something apart for God's use.
