In the Levitical system, the "most holy food" includes offerings such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, which were reserved for the priests and their families (<a href="/leviticus/6-17.htm">Leviticus 6:17-18, 7</a>:6). This provision underscores the grace and inclusivity within the priestly system, allowing all priests, regardless of physical condition, to participate in the sustenance provided by God. Theologically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant, where all believers, regardless of status or condition, are invited to partake in the spiritual blessings of Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>as well as the holy food</b><br>The "holy food" refers to other offerings that were not as restricted as the "most holy" ones, such as the peace offerings, which could be eaten by the offerer and their family (<a href="/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15-21</a>). This inclusion highlights the communal aspect of worship in ancient Israel, where the act of eating was both a physical and spiritual act of fellowship with God. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of the communal meal shared by believers in the Lord's Supper, symbolizing unity and fellowship in the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>). The provision for priests with defects to eat both types of food emphasizes God's provision and care for all His servants, reflecting His character of mercy and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a> is on the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were set apart for service in the tabernacle and later the temple.

God&#8217;s perfect Word affirms both His holiness and His compassion.<p>&#8226; The permission shows that priestly identity is rooted in covenant, not physical perfection (cp. <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Eating signifies fellowship with God; even the restricted priest remains part of the sacred household (<a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By granting access to the food, the Lord protects the priest from human shame while upholding the integrity of temple service (cf. <a href="/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> where holiness covers imperfection).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the most holy food of his God</b><p>&#8220;Most holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>; 6:17; 7:6) refers to portions reserved exclusively for priests:<p>&#8226; Grain offerings baked without yeast<p>&#8226; Sin and guilt offerings eaten in the court of the tent of meeting<p>&#8226; The perpetual bread of the Presence (<a href="/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>)<p>These portions symbolize complete dedication.
