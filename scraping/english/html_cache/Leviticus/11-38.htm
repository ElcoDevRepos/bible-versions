The act of putting water on the seed signifies a readiness for growth and life. However, in Levitical law, the introduction of water also makes the seed susceptible to ritual impurity. This reflects the broader biblical theme where water, while a symbol of life and cleansing, can also be a medium through which impurity is transmitted. This duality is seen in other scriptures, such as the flood in Genesis, which both cleansed the earth and brought destruction.<p><b>and a carcass falls on it</b><br>The carcass represents death and decay, which are antithetical to the holiness and purity required by God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, contact with a dead body was a common source of impurity, as seen in <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>. The falling of a carcass on the seed symbolizes the intrusion of death into the realm of life and growth. This imagery can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of sin and death entering the world through Adam, as described in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>.<p><b>it is unclean for you</b><br>The declaration of uncleanness serves as a reminder of the Israelites' call to be a holy people, set apart for God. The concept of uncleanness is not merely about physical contamination but also about spiritual and moral separation from God. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live lives that are holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The laws of purity in Leviticus, including this one, point to the need for a mediator who can cleanse and restore the relationship between God and humanity, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the one who purifies us from all unrighteousness (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the Levitical laws, including dietary and purity laws, as they journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law, emphasizing their need for guidance and holiness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seed.htm">Seed</a></b><br>Represents potential food and sustenance, crucial for the survival and prosperity of the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/carcass.htm">Carcass</a></b><br>Symbolizes impurity and death, which contaminates what it touches according to the law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The laws in Leviticus emphasize the need for the Israelites to be distinct and holy, set apart for God.

Our verse, <a href="/leviticus/11-38.htm">Leviticus 11:38</a>, drills down to one specific scenario, building on verse 37 (&#8220;If a carcass falls on any seed for sowing that has not been wetted, it remains clean&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The surrounding law is precise because Israel was to &#8220;be holy, for I am holy&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The issue is not hygiene alone but covenant obedience, echoing the earlier commands about contagious impurity from touch (<a href="/leviticus/11-24.htm">Leviticus 11:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;but if water has been put on the seed&#8221;</b><p>Dry seed was exempt (<a href="/leviticus/11-37.htm">Leviticus 11:37</a>); once wetted, the situation changes.<p>&#8226; Moisture allows impurity to penetrate (compare <a href="/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>, where liquids inside a vessel become defiled).<p>&#8226; Ordinary farm activity&#8212;soaking seed for germination&#8212;now carries spiritual implications, reminding Israel that holiness reaches into daily work (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and a carcass falls on it&#8221;</b><p>The carcass in view is that of any &#8220;creature that moves along the ground&#8221; listed in <a href="/leviticus/11-29.htm">Leviticus 11:29-30</a>.<p>&#8226; Contact is accidental but still serious; unintentional defilement was part of life in a fallen world (<a href="/leviticus/4-27.htm">Leviticus 4:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical closeness to death symbolized moral uncleanness (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>), foreshadowing the need for a greater cleansing (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;it is unclean for you&#8221;</b><p>God&#8217;s verdict is final: the soaked seed is no longer fit for use or consumption.<p>&#8226; Defilement spreads from carcass &#8594; water &#8594; seed &#8594; person, showing that impurity moves outward unless checked (<a href="/haggai/2-13.htm">Haggai 2:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The law teaches separation: anything contaminated must be discarded or purified before fellowship with God resumes (<a href="/leviticus/11-40.htm">Leviticus 11:40</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Underlying Principle</b><p>1.
