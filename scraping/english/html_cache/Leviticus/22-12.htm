The priests, from the tribe of Levi, had specific roles and responsibilities, including offering sacrifices and maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle and later the temple. A priest's family, including his daughter, was considered part of this sacred community. However, if a priest's daughter married outside of this community, to a man who was not a priest, she would no longer be part of the priestly household. This reflects the importance of maintaining the purity and distinctiveness of the priestly line, as seen in other passages such as <a href="/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11-13</a>, which outlines the privileges and responsibilities of the priestly family.<p><b>she is not to eat of the sacred contributions</b><br>The sacred contributions refer to portions of the offerings that were designated for the priests and their families, as described in <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>. These included parts of the peace offerings and other sacrifices that were considered holy and set apart for those serving in the temple. By marrying outside the priestly line, the daughter would no longer have the right to partake in these holy offerings, emphasizing the separation between the sacred duties of the priesthood and the rest of the community. This regulation underscores the holiness required of those who serve in God's presence and the need to respect the boundaries set by God for His people. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of being set apart for God's service, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are called a "royal priesthood."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest's_daughter.htm">Priest's Daughter</a></b><br>A female descendant of a priest, who is subject to specific laws regarding her conduct and privileges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>A male member of the tribe of Levi, specifically from the line of Aaron, responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the sanctuary.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_contributions.htm">Sacred Contributions</a></b><br>Offerings made by the Israelites, which were designated for the sustenance of the priests and their families.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The union of the priest's daughter to a man who is not a priest, which affects her rights to partake in the sacred offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which these laws were given, emphasizing the holiness and separation of the priestly class.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The priestly family was set apart for service to God, and their lifestyle reflected this separation.
