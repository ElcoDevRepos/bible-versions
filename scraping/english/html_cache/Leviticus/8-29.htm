This act signifies the special role Moses played as the mediator between God and the Israelites. The breast, often associated with affection and care, symbolizes the nurturing leadership Moses provided. In the broader context of Levitical sacrifices, the breast was typically given to the priests, indicating their right to partake in the offerings. This specific allocation to Moses underscores his unique position during this pivotal moment in Israel's religious history.<p><b>and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering,</b><br>The wave offering involved a specific ritual where the offering was moved back and forth before the altar, symbolizing the presentation of the gift to God and His acceptance of it. This act of waving was a gesture of dedication and consecration, signifying that the offering was given to God but also returned for the use of the priest. The wave offering is a recurring theme in Levitical law, emphasizing the reciprocal relationship between God and His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate offering of Christ, who was both given to God and returned to humanity as the High Priest.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded him.</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands, a central theme in Leviticus. The detailed instructions given to Moses were to be followed precisely, reflecting the holiness and order required in worship. This obedience is not only a matter of ritual but also a demonstration of faith and submission to God's will. The phrase underscores the necessity of adhering to divine instructions, which is echoed throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the fulfillment of the Law through love and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and to give them His laws.
