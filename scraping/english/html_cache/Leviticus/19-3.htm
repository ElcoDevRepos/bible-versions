Respecting parents is foundational to maintaining social order and is reiterated in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). In ancient Israel, the family was the primary unit of society, and honoring parents was seen as honoring God Himself. This respect extends beyond mere obedience to include care and provision, especially as parents age. The command also reflects the broader biblical principle of honoring authority, which is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>). <p><b>and you must keep My Sabbaths</b><br>The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). Observing the Sabbath was a way for the Israelites to demonstrate their trust in God&#8217;s provision and to set themselves apart from other nations. It was a day of rest and worship, reflecting God&#8217;s rest on the seventh day of creation (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). The Sabbath also foreshadows the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), symbolizing spiritual rest and redemption. Keeping the Sabbath was a tangible expression of faith and obedience, reinforcing the rhythm of work and rest ordained by God.<p><b>I am the LORD your God</b><br>This phrase serves as a divine affirmation of authority and relationship. It reminds the Israelites of their unique covenant relationship with God, who delivered them from Egypt and established them as His people (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). The declaration "I am the LORD" is a frequent refrain in Leviticus, underscoring God's holiness and the call for His people to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). It emphasizes that the commands given are not arbitrary but are rooted in the character and authority of God Himself. This statement also points to the exclusivity of worship and allegiance due to God alone, rejecting idolatry and affirming monotheism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Leviticus, who received the laws from God to instruct the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Leviticus, who were given these laws to live as God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver, emphasizing His authority and covenant relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/parents.htm">Parents (Mother and Father)</a></b><br>Central figures in the family unit, deserving of respect and honor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>A holy day of rest instituted by God, symbolizing His creation rest and covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_authority.htm">Respect for Authority</a></b><br>The command to respect parents underscores the importance of honoring authority figures in our lives, reflecting our respect for God's authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_as_a_foundation.htm">Family as a Foundation</a></b><br>The family unit is central to God's design for society.

Honoring parents remains a direct expression of honoring God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you must keep My Sabbaths</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sabbaths&#8221; includes the weekly Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>) and the festival Sabbaths (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/23.htm">Leviticus 23</a>). God guards times of rest and worship for His people&#8217;s good.<p>&#8226; Keeping the Sabbath meant:<p>&#8211; Ceasing from ordinary work (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-15</a>).<p>&#8211; Gathering for holy assembly (<a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a>).<p>&#8211; Trusting God to provide even when one does not work (<a href="/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed the life-giving purpose of the Sabbath: &#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p>&#8226; While believers differ on the day&#8217;s observance, the principle of rhythmic rest and worship continues (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>). It stands as a weekly reminder that God, not our labor, sustains us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am the LORD your God</b><p>&#8226; The verse ends by anchoring both commands in God&#8217;s character.

His unchanging nature guarantees the relevance of His commands.<p>&#8226; Because He redeemed Israel, obedience was the grateful response (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9-11</a>). The same applies to believers today who have been redeemed by Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm">1 Peter 1:14-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm">Leviticus 19:3</a> links family honor and Sabbath observance, tying both to the Lord&#8217;s own identity.

Together they express lived-out holiness under the watchful care of &#8220;the LORD your God.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father.</span>--The first means to attain to the holiness which is to make the Israelite reflect the holiness of God, is uniformly to reverence his parents. Thus the group of precepts contained in this chapter opens with the fifth commandment in the Decalogue (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>), or, as the Apostle calls it, the first commandment with promise (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm" title="Honor your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;">Ephesians 6:2</a>). During the second Temple, already the spiritual authorities called attention to the singular fact that this is one of the three instances in the Scriptures where, contrary to the usual practice, the mother is mentioned before the father; the other two being <a href="/genesis/44-20.htm" title="And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.">Genesis 44:20</a> and <a href="/leviticus/21-2.htm" title="But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.">Leviticus 21:2</a>. As children ordinarily fear the father and love the mother, hence they say precedence is here given to the mother in order to inculcate the duty of fearing them both alike. The expression "fear," however, they take to include the following :--(1) Not to stand or sit in the place set apart for the parents; (2) not to carp at or oppose their statements; and (3) not to call them by their proper names, but either to call them father or mother, or my master, my lady. Whilst the expression "honour," which is used in the parallel passage in <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>, they understand to include (1) to provide them with food and raiment, and (2) to escort them. The parents, they urge, are God's representatives upon earth; hence as God is both to be "honoured" with our substance (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm" title="Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the first fruits of all your increase:">Proverbs 3:9</a>), and as He is to be "feared" (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>), so our parents are both to be "honoured" (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>) and "feared" (<a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm" title="You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:3</a>); and as he who blasphemes the name of God is stoned (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16</a>), so he who curses his father or mother is stoned (<a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm" title="For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be on him.">Leviticus 20:9</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father.</span> The words <span class="accented">fear</span> and <span class="accented">reverence</span> are in this connection interchangeable. So <a href="/ephesians/5-33.htm">Ephesians 5:33</a>, "Let the wife see that she reverence her husband," where the word "reverence" would be more exactly translated by "fear." St. Paul points out that the importance of the fifth commandment is indicated in the Decalogue by its being" the first commandment with promise," that is, with a promise attached to it (<a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>). The family life is built upon reverence to parents, and on the family is built society. Obedience to parents is a duty flowing out of one of the first two laws instituted by God - the law of marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). The second law instituted at the same time was that of the sabbath (<a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>), and in the verse before us observance of the sabbatical law is likewise inculcated, in the words that immediately follow - ye shall keep my sabbaths. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/19-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of you must respect</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
