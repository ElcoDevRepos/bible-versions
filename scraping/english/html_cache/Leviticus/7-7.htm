Both offerings address the issue of sin, but the guilt offering specifically deals with sins that require restitution, such as defrauding a neighbor or misusing holy things. The sin offering, on the other hand, is more general, covering unintentional sins and purification. The similarity between the two offerings highlights the comprehensive nature of atonement in the Old Testament, emphasizing the need for both reconciliation with God and restitution with others. This reflects the dual aspect of sin, affecting both divine and human relationships.<p><b>the same law applies to both.</b><br>This phrase underscores the uniformity and consistency in the sacrificial system. The laws governing these offerings are detailed in Leviticus chapters 4 through 7, providing a structured approach to atonement. The same law applying to both offerings indicates that the principles of atonement, repentance, and restitution are universally applicable, regardless of the specific nature of the sin. This consistency points to the unchanging nature of God's justice and mercy. It also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills all aspects of the law and provides a once-for-all atonement for sin.<p><b>It belongs to the priest</b><br>The offerings belong to the priest as part of their provision. In the ancient Israelite context, priests did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes, so they relied on portions of the offerings for their sustenance. This provision underscores the role of the priest as a mediator between God and the people, a role that is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our High Priest. The priest's portion also signifies the sharing of the benefits of atonement, as the priest represents the people before God.<p><b>who makes atonement with it.</b><br>The priest's role in making atonement is central to the sacrificial system. Atonement involves covering or cleansing sin, restoring the relationship between the sinner and God. The priest acts as an intermediary, performing the rituals that symbolize the removal of sin. This anticipates the work of Christ, who makes atonement for humanity through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The concept of atonement is foundational to understanding the nature of sin, the holiness of God, and the necessity of a mediator, ultimately pointing to the redemptive work of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The priests are the descendants of Aaron, tasked with performing sacrifices and rituals in the Tabernacle and later the Temple.

By declaring, &#8220;The guilt offering is like the sin offering,&#8221; God shows that every kind of sin&#8212;whether deliberate trespass or unwitting failure&#8212;requires shed blood for restoration (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; These offerings foreshadow Christ, &#8220;who offered Himself for us, a fragrant aroma and sacrifice to God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).
