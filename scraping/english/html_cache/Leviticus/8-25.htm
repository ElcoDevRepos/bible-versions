The act of Moses taking the fat signifies the offering of the best to God, a principle seen throughout the Old Testament. This reflects the idea of giving God the first and finest, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>.<p><b>the fat tail,</b><br>The fat tail, particularly in sheep, was a prized portion in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It was considered a delicacy and a symbol of abundance. This specific mention highlights the importance of offering valuable parts to God, emphasizing the sacrificial system's demand for quality.<p><b>all the fat that was on the entrails,</b><br>The entrails, or inner parts, were often associated with the seat of emotions and inner life in biblical literature. Offering the fat from the entrails symbolizes dedicating one's innermost being to God, aligning with the call for internal purity and devotion found in <a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>.<p><b>the lobe of the liver,</b><br>The liver was considered a vital organ in ancient times, often associated with life and purification. The inclusion of the liver's lobe in the offering underscores the comprehensive nature of the sacrifice, ensuring that all significant parts are dedicated to God, reflecting the thoroughness required in worship.<p><b>and both kidneys with their fat&#8212;</b><br>Kidneys were seen as the seat of emotion and conscience in Hebrew thought. Offering them signifies a surrender of one's deepest thoughts and feelings to God. This act can be connected to the call for purity of heart and mind, as seen in <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a>.<p><b>as well as the right thigh.</b><br>The right thigh was traditionally given to the priest as a portion of the peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32-33</a>). Its inclusion here in the consecration of Aaron and his sons signifies the priestly privilege and responsibility.
