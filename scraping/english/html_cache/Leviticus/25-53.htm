The law required that such a person be treated as a hired worker rather than a slave. This reflects the dignity and value placed on every individual, emphasizing that even in servitude, an Israelite retains certain rights and should be treated with respect. The concept of a hired worker implies a temporary and contractual relationship, highlighting the hope of eventual freedom and restoration. This principle is rooted in the broader biblical theme of redemption and liberation, as seen in the Jubilee laws (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>), which ensured that no Israelite would remain in servitude indefinitely.<p><b>but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the potential for abuse by foreign owners who might not adhere to Israelite laws and customs. The prohibition against harsh rule underscores the importance of justice and compassion, even towards those in vulnerable positions. Historically, foreign rule often brought oppression, as seen in Israel's own experience in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). This command serves as a reminder of God's deliverance and the call to reflect His character in all relationships. The prohibition against harshness aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's concern for the oppressed and His call for His people to act justly (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>in your sight</b><br>The phrase "in your sight" implies accountability within the community. It suggests that the treatment of servants was not just a private matter but one of public concern. This communal aspect reflects the covenantal nature of Israel's society, where individuals were responsible for upholding God's laws collectively. The visibility of actions within the community served as a deterrent against mistreatment and ensured that justice was maintained. This principle of accountability is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live transparently and in community, bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>) and holding each other accountable to God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The primary audience of Leviticus, receiving laws and instructions from God through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jubilee_year.htm">Jubilee Year</a></b><br>A significant event in Israelite society occurring every 50 years, emphasizing freedom and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_worker.htm">Hired Worker</a></b><br>Refers to an Israelite who has sold himself due to poverty, to be treated with dignity and fairness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/master/employer.htm">Master/Employer</a></b><br>The person who hires the worker, responsible for treating him justly.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the laws to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dignity_in_labor.htm">Dignity in Labor</a></b><br>Every worker deserves to be treated with respect and fairness, reflecting their inherent dignity as God's creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_compassion.htm">Justice and Compassion</a></b><br>Employers are called to exercise justice and compassion, avoiding harshness and exploitation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_ownership.htm">God's Ownership</a></b><br>Recognize that ultimately, God is the owner of all, and we are stewards of His resources, including human resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_and_restoration.htm">Freedom and Restoration</a></b><br>The principles of the Jubilee remind us of God's desire for freedom and restoration, both physically and spiritually.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ-like_leadership.htm">Christ-like Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders and employers should model Christ's servant leadership, prioritizing the well-being of those under their care.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Leviticus_25_53_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Leviticus 25:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_Fair_worker_treatment.htm">How does Leviticus 25:53 emphasize fair treatment of workers in today's context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_Accountability_lesson.htm">What does "year by year" teach about accountability and stewardship in Leviticus 25:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_s_business_ethics_today.htm">How can Leviticus 25:53 guide Christians in ethical business practices today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_vs_Colossians_4_1_Justice.htm">Compare Leviticus 25:53 with Colossians 4:1 on treating workers justly.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Leviticus 25:53 reflect God's justice and mercy in economic relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_on_servitude_fairness.htm">What does Leviticus 25:53 reveal about God's view on servitude and fairness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Leviticus_25_53_and_biblical_justice.htm">How does Leviticus 25:53 align with the overall message of justice in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_servant_treatment_in_Lev_25_53.htm">Why is the treatment of servants emphasized in Leviticus 25:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_leviticus_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Leviticus 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_it_permissible_to_beat_slaves.htm">Is it permissible to beat slaves?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_god_view_re-enslavement_vs._slavery.htm">Jeremiah 34:11-17 -
