It signifies reconciliation and communion with God, emphasizing a restored relationship. Unlike the burnt offering, which is entirely consumed, the peace offering allows for a shared meal between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing fellowship. This offering can be seen as a precursor to the communal aspects of the Lord's Supper in the New Testament, where believers share in the body and blood of Christ.<p><b>that one may present</b><br>The act of presenting an offering underscores the voluntary nature of the peace offering. It is not mandated by sin or guilt but is a freewill act of worship and thanksgiving. This voluntary aspect highlights the personal relationship between the worshiper and God, reflecting the heart's desire to honor and thank the Lord. The presentation of offerings is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, seen in the offerings of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4) and the dedication of the temple by Solomon (1 Kings 8).<p><b>to the LORD</b><br>The offering is directed to the LORD, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and His people. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the divine name YHWH, the covenant name of God revealed to Moses. This covenantal aspect is crucial, as it reminds the Israelites of their unique relationship with God, who delivered them from Egypt and established them as His chosen people. The peace offering, therefore, is not just a ritual but a reaffirmation of this covenant relationship. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ fulfills and embodies this covenant, offering peace and reconciliation through His sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and commandments were given, including the laws of offerings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, where offerings and sacrifices were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Descendants of Aaron, responsible for performing the sacrifices and offerings as prescribed by the law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peace_offering.htm">The Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_peace_offering.htm">Understanding the Peace Offering</a></b><br>The peace offering was a voluntary act of worship, expressing gratitude and fellowship with God.

There are three sorts of peace offerings - thank offerings (verses 12-15), votive offerings, and voluntary offerings (verses 16-18). Of these, the thank offerings were made in thankful memorial for past mercies; votive offerings were made in fulfillment of a vow previously taken, that such offering should be presented if a terrain condition were fulfilled. Voluntary offerings differ from votive offerings by not having been previously vowed, and from thank offerings by not having reference to any special mercy received. The thank offering must be eaten by the offerer and his friends, on the same day that it was offered; the votive and the voluntary offerings, which were inferior to the thank offering in sanctity, on the same day or the next. The reason why a longer time was not given probably was that the more the meal was delayed, the less would a religious character be attached to it. The necessity of a quick consumption also took away the temptation of acting grudgingly towards those with whom the feast might be shared, and it likewise precluded the danger of the flesh becoming corrupted. If any of the flesh remained till the third day, it was to be <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire</span>; if eaten on that day, it should not be <span class="cmt_word">accepted or imputed unto him that offered</span>, that is, it should not be regarded as a sacrifice of sweet savour to God, but an abomination (literally, <span class="accented">a stench</span>), and whoever ate it should <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, should be guilty of an offense, requiring, probably, a sin offering to atone for it. The bread gift accompanying the animal sacrifice was to consist of three kinds of unleavened cakes, and one cake of leavened bread, and <span class="cmt_word">one out of the whole oblation</span>, that is, one cake of each kind, was to be offered by heaving and then given to the officiating priest, the remaining cakes forming a part of the offerer's festive meal. If any one took part of a feast on a peace offering while in a state of Levitical uncleanness, he was to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from his people</span>, that is, excommunicated, without permission to recover immediate communion by offering a sin offering. St. Paul joined in a votive offering (<a href="/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1494;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the law</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8451.htm">Strong's 8451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Direction, instruction, law</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the peace offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8002.htm">Strong's 8002: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacrifice for alliance or friendship, peace offering</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one may present</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(yaq&#183;r&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7126.htm">Strong's 7126: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come near, approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">OT Law: Leviticus 7:11 This is the law of the sacrifice (Le Lv Lev.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/leviticus/7-10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Leviticus 7:10"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 7:10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Leviticus 7:12"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 7:12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
