The Mosaic Law provided various protections for the poor, emphasizing community responsibility and compassion. The term "brother" signifies a fellow member of the Israelite community, highlighting the familial bond among God's people. This reflects the broader biblical principle of caring for those in need, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a> and <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>.<p><b>and sells some of his property</b><br>In ancient Israel, land was a crucial asset, representing both livelihood and inheritance. Selling land was often a last resort for those in financial distress. The land was considered a divine gift, and its sale was not taken lightly. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where the land was part of the promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The sale of land due to poverty underscores the severity of the individual's situation.<p><b>his nearest of kin may come</b><br>The concept of the "nearest of kin" or "kinsman-redeemer" (Hebrew: go'el) is central to this passage. This role involved a family member stepping in to assist relatives in distress, whether by redeeming land, marrying a widow to preserve the family line (as in the story of Ruth and Boaz), or avenging wrongful death. This practice ensured the preservation of family heritage and stability within the community.<p><b>and redeem what his brother has sold</b><br>Redemption here involves buying back the property to keep it within the family. This act of redemption is a powerful symbol of restoration and hope, reflecting God's redemptive work throughout Scripture. The kinsman-redeemer is a type of Christ, who redeems humanity from sin and restores us to our intended inheritance. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ is portrayed as our Redeemer (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/brother.htm">Brother</a></b><br>Refers to a fellow Israelite who has fallen into poverty and is forced to sell his property.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nearest_kinsman.htm">Nearest Kinsman</a></b><br>A close relative who has the responsibility and opportunity to redeem the property sold by the impoverished brother.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/property.htm">Property</a></b><br>The land or possessions that the impoverished brother has sold due to financial hardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/redemption.htm">Redemption</a></b><br>The act of buying back the property to restore it to the original family owner, reflecting God's provision and care for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom these laws were given, emphasizing community responsibility and familial support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The law emphasizes the importance of family and community in supporting those in need.

This will account for the horror which Naboth expressed to Ahab of selling his patrimony: "The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee" (<a href="/1_kings/21-3.htm" title="And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.">1Kings 21:3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">then his nearest kinsman shall come and redeem. </span>If he has thus been compelled by pressure of poverty to sell part of his land, then it is the duty of the nearest relation, or, as the original literally denotes, "the redeemer that is nearest to him," to redeem the property which his impoverished relative has been obliged to sell. The expression "redeemer" is applied in Hebrew to one who, by virtue of being the nearest of kin, had not only to redeem the patrimony of the family, but to marry the childless widow of his brother (<a href="/ruth/3-13.htm" title="Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning.">Ruth 3:13</a>), and avenge the blood of his relative (<a href="/context/numbers/35-19.htm" title="The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him.">Numbers 35:19-28</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/19-6.htm" title="Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.">Deuteronomy 19:6-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - The right of redemption of land sold continued always alive, and might be exercised by the original owner or his kinsman.
