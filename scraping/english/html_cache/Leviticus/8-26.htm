Unleavened bread, free from yeast, symbolizes purity and separation from sin, aligning with the holiness required of the priesthood. The presence of the basket "before the LORD" indicates the offering's dedication to God, emphasizing His holiness and the need for purity in worship.<p><b>he took one cake of unleavened bread</b><br>The cake of unleavened bread represents the sustenance provided by God, free from corruption. In the broader biblical narrative, unleavened bread is associated with the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>), symbolizing the haste of the Israelites' departure from Egypt and their reliance on God. This act of taking the bread signifies the priest's role in mediating between God and the people, offering what is pure and acceptable.<p><b>one cake of bread made with oil</b><br>Bread made with oil signifies richness and the presence of the Holy Spirit, as oil often symbolizes anointing and consecration in Scripture. The use of oil in the bread highlights the anointing of the priests, setting them apart for divine service. This can be seen as a type of Christ, the Anointed One, who fulfills the role of the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>and one wafer</b><br>The wafer, a thin unleavened bread, further emphasizes purity and simplicity in offerings to God. It reflects the need for humility and sincerity in worship. The wafer's inclusion in the consecration ceremony underscores the completeness of the offering, covering various forms of bread to symbolize the totality of devotion required.<p><b>and he placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh</b><br>The fat portions and the right thigh were parts of the peace offering, symbolizing the best and most valued parts given to God. Placing the bread on these portions signifies the integration of the priestly role with the sacrificial system, highlighting the importance of offering the best to God. The right thigh, often reserved for the priest, indicates the provision for those who serve in God's presence, pointing to the sustenance and honor given to those dedicated to His service. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself wholly to God for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
