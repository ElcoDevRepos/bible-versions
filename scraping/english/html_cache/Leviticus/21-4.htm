The term "defile" refers to becoming ceremonially unclean, which would disqualify a priest from performing his sacred duties. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and impurity, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, where believers are called to be separate from the world.<p><b>for those related to him by marriage</b><br>This phrase indicates that the priest is not to become ceremonially unclean even for in-laws, highlighting the importance of maintaining ritual purity. In ancient Israel, family ties were significant, but the priest's duty to God took precedence. This can be compared to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, where He emphasizes the priority of devotion to God over familial relationships.<p><b>and so profane himself</b><br>To "profane" means to treat something sacred with irreverence or disrespect. For a priest, becoming unclean would mean treating his holy office with disregard. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a>, where priests are instructed to teach the people the difference between the holy and the common. The priest's role as a mediator between God and the people foreshadows Christ, our ultimate High Priest, who is described in <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a> as "holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The primary focus of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a> is on the priests, who were set apart for service in the tabernacle and later the temple.

If he became unclean, he was barred from tabernacle service until purified, disrupting Israel&#8217;s worship.<p>&#8226; God presents Himself as holy and requires those who draw near to reflect that holiness (<a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). So the priest&#8217;s personal life directly affected the nation&#8217;s ability to approach God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for those related to him by marriage</b><p>&#8226; Verses 2-3 list close blood relatives (mother, father, son, daughter, brother, unmarried sister) for whom the priest may attend a funeral. The phrase in verse 4 widens the circle to relatives by marriage&#8212;his wife&#8217;s family, married sisters, extended kin.<p>&#8226; The restriction guards the priest from constant ceremonial impurity caused by the larger clan. Israel&#8217;s family networks were extensive; without limits, a priest could be excluded from service for long stretches.<p>&#8226; By allowing exceptions only for immediate blood family, God shows compassion yet preserves the priest&#8217;s primary duty: representing the people before Him (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so profane himself</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Profane&#8221; contrasts with &#8220;holy.&#8221; To profane himself was to treat sacred service as common, lowering God&#8217;s set-apart standards (<a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-23.htm">Ezekiel 44:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The priest bore God&#8217;s name publicly (<a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm">Leviticus 22:2</a>).

His perfect purity fulfills what Levitical priests only illustrated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/21-4.htm">Leviticus 21:4</a> restricts a priest from funeral contact with relatives gained through marriage to prevent unnecessary ritual defilement. God balances family compassion with the priest&#8217;s higher calling to remain holy for tabernacle ministry. The verse underscores God&#8217;s holiness, the seriousness of priestly service, and ultimately foreshadows Christ&#8217;s flawless, eternal priesthood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">A husband shall not defile himself among his people when he had profaned himself. </span>As the seven exceptions to the general rule began with his wife, whose funeral rites the priestly husband is allowed to attend, the verse before us restricts this permission to his legally prescribed wife. If he contracted a marriage which profaned him, he could not attend to her funeral ceremonies. The last clause, which is here translated, "when he had profaned him," literally denotes "to profane himself," "with respect to his profanation"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>with respect to a marriage by which he profaned himself. This is the interpretation which the administrators of the Law attached to the verse, and which is transmitted in the Chaldee version of Jonathan. It is not only in perfect harmony with the context, but does least violence to this manifestly disordered text. The translations exhibited in the Authorised version, both in the text and in the margin, as well as most of those suggested by modern commentators, leave the clause unexplained, since it manifestly means something else than defiling himself by contracting impurity through contact with the dead, as is evident from the fact that it is not added in the other instances where the priest is forbidden to defile himself by attending to the dead.
