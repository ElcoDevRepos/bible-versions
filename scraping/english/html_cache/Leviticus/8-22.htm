The use of "other ram" suggests that there was a previous ram involved in the ceremony, specifically the ram for the burnt offering (<a href="/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18</a>). The presentation of the ram signifies the importance of the sacrificial system in establishing the priesthood. The ram, a valuable animal, symbolizes strength and leadership, qualities necessary for the priestly role.<p><b>the ram of ordination</b><br>The term "ordination" refers to the consecration or setting apart of Aaron and his sons for the priestly service. This specific ram is used for the ordination offering, which is a unique sacrifice that signifies the dedication of the priests to their sacred duties. The Hebrew word for ordination can also mean "filling," indicating that the priests are being filled with authority and responsibility. This act foreshadows the New Testament concept of being filled with the Holy Spirit for service (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head</b><br>The laying on of hands is a symbolic act of identification and transfer. By placing their hands on the ram's head, Aaron and his sons identify with the sacrifice, symbolically transferring their sins and responsibilities onto the animal. This act signifies their acknowledgment of the need for atonement and purification before serving as mediators between God and the people. It prefigures the laying on of hands in the New Testament, where it is used for ordination, healing, and impartation of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and to deliver His laws.
