This reflects the broader covenant community and the expectation that all who live within Israel's borders adhere to God's laws. The presence of foreigners in Israel is acknowledged throughout the Old Testament, and they were often expected to follow certain laws, especially those related to worship and purity (<a href="/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>).<p><b>eats any blood</b><br>The prohibition against consuming blood is a significant aspect of the Mosaic Law. Blood is considered sacred because it represents life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). This command underscores the sanctity of life and the importance of respecting God's creation. The prohibition is reiterated in the New Testament, where the early church, in <a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>, instructs Gentile believers to abstain from blood, showing its continued relevance.<p><b>I will set My face against that person</b><br>This phrase indicates God's active opposition to those who disobey this command. Setting His face against someone implies divine judgment and disfavor. In biblical terms, God's face represents His presence and blessing (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). Therefore, to have His face set against someone is to be deprived of His favor and protection.<p><b>and cut him off from among his people</b><br>Being "cut off" can imply either a divine or communal act of exclusion. It often means death or being ostracized from the community, which in ancient Israel was a severe punishment. This reflects the seriousness of the offense and the need to maintain the holiness and purity of the community. The concept of being cut off is seen in other contexts, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> regarding the covenant of circumcision, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_israel.htm">House of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who are the chosen people of God.

Nobody living under God&#8217;s covenant umbrella is excused.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s inclusion of &#8220;a foreigner living among them&#8221; shows His moral expectations extend beyond ethnic Israel. Compare <a href="/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>, &#8220;The same law shall apply to the native and to the foreigner who resides among you&#8221;.<p>&#8226; This universality anticipates the New Testament church, where one body is formed from Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>). The principle: when God sets a boundary for His people, everyone who identifies with them must honor it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>eats any blood</b><p>&#8226; Blood is singled out because &#8220;the life of the flesh is in the blood&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Life belongs to God; consuming blood treats what is sacred as common.<p>&#8226; The restriction predates Sinai. After the flood God told Noah, &#8220;But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood still in it&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). So the rule is woven into God&#8217;s moral fabric for humanity, not merely Israel&#8217;s ceremonial code.<p>&#8226; Later, when the Jerusalem council guided Gentile believers, they repeated this same prohibition (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>). Clearly the significance endures beyond Old Covenant ritual.<p>&#8226; Practical obedience meant draining an animal completely&#8212;&#8220;You must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>). This was a public act of respect for life and the Giver of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will set My face against that person</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Set My face against&#8221; is a solemn expression of God&#8217;s personal opposition (<a href="/jeremiah/44-11.htm">Jeremiah 44:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>). The offender isn&#8217;t merely breaking an impersonal rule; he is provoking the living God.<p>&#8226; When God turns His face away, blessing is lost (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). When He sets His face against someone, judgment is guaranteed.<p>&#8226; The warning underlines how God guards His holiness. Treating life-blood lightly challenges the very character of the One who gives life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and cut him off from among his people</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Cut off&#8221; carries the idea of exclusion from covenant blessings&#8212;whether through death, disease, or banishment (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-27.htm">Leviticus 7:27</a>; 18:29). Only God knows the exact form, but the outcome is severe.<p>&#8226; Such discipline protects the community. Permit one person to disregard God&#8217;s holiness, and the entire nation is put at risk (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately this foreshadows eternal separation for those who persist in rebellion. <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a> pictures the unrepentant &#8220;outside&#8221; the New Jerusalem, excluded from the people of God forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a> warns that consuming blood&#8212;symbolic of life that belongs to God&#8212;is a direct affront to Him. The command is universal, covering Israelite and foreigner alike. Disregarding it invites God&#8217;s personal opposition and removal from covenant fellowship. The principle still speaks today: life is sacred, God&#8217;s holiness is non-negotiable, and obedience is the only safe response to His clear Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And whatsoever man.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">and what man soever. </span>(See <a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm" title="And you shall say to them, Whatever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,">Leviticus 17:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Eateth any manner of blood.</span>--This prohibition, which has already been mentioned twice in Leviticus, is in both instances joined to the prohibition of fat. (See <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm" title="It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that you eat neither fat nor blood.">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/7-26.htm" title="Moreover you shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.">Leviticus 7:26-27</a>.) Owing to its great importance, however, the law is enacted here <span class= "ital">separately, </span>where it naturally follows the order that the blood of all animals sacrificed in the sanctuary is to be offered to the Lord upon the altar. According to the canons which obtained during the second Temple, the blood of clean fishes, of locusts, and of permissible creeping things is exempted.<p><span class= "bld">I will even set my face against that soul.</span>--That is, make him feel my anger. Though this phrase only occurs twice more in this book, and only once in connection with legal enactments (see <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm" title="And the soul that turns after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm" title="And I will set my face against you, and you shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.">Leviticus 26:17</a>), yet from its usages in other passages it is clear that the expression "face" denotes anger, which shows itself in the countenance. Thus the phrase, which is translated in the Authorised Version, "I will appease him" (<a href="/genesis/30-20.htm" title="And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.">Genesis 30:20</a>), is in the original, "I will appease his face," where it manifestly stands for <span class= "ital">anger. </span>Hence <a href="/lamentations/4-16.htm" title="The anger of the LORD has divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.">Lamentations 4:16</a>, which is in the original, "the face of the Lord hath divided them," is properly rendered in the Authorised Version in the text by "the anger of the Lord." (Comp. also <a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm" title="For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.">1Peter 3:12</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - The appointment made just above, that the blood of all animals slain in sacrifice should be offered to the Lord on his altar in the court of the tabernacle, leads naturally to a reiteration of the prohibition of the eating of blood, and a statement of the reason of that prohibition. "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat," was given as a command to Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). It has already been repeated twice in the Book of Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>), and it is still again found in chapter Leviticus 19:26; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>. The present is the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> which explains the earnestness with which the rule is enforced. It begins with an extension of the obligation from the Israelites to the sojourners among them, and with a solemn declaration that, in case of transgression, God will take into his own bands the punishment of the offenders; not only is he to be cut off or excommunicated by political or ecclesiastical authority, but God himself will <span class="cmt_word">set his face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people,</span> by death, or such means as he chooses to adopt. Then follows the reason for the prohibition. <span class="cmt_word">For the life of the flesh is in the blood.</span> The blood may not be eaten because it is the vehicle of life, literally, <span class="accented">the soul of the flesh</span>, that is, it is the seat of the animal life of the body. "It is the fountain of life," says Harvey; "the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body." In consequence of possessing this character, it is to be reserved, <span class="cmt_word">to make an atonement for your souls upon the altar;</span> for thus only blood became qualified for the purpose of atonement. The clause, <span class="cmt_word">for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul,</span> should be translated, <span class="accented">for the blood maketh atonement by means of the soul, i.e.</span>, by means of the life which it contains. It is because the blood is the vehicle of the animal's life, and represents that life, that it serves to cover, or make atonement for, the soul of the offerer of the sacrifice, who presents it instead of his own life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/17-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
