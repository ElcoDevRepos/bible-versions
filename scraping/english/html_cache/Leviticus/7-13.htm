This offering was distinct from sin and guilt offerings, which were mandatory. The peace offering could be given for thanksgiving, fulfilling a vow, or as a freewill offering. In this context, the thanksgiving aspect highlights the worshiper's acknowledgment of God's provision and blessings. The peace offering is a communal meal shared between the offerer, the priests, and God, symbolizing fellowship and reconciliation. This offering foreshadows the ultimate peace and reconciliation brought by Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Prince of Peace" (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<p><b>he is to present an offering</b><br>The act of presenting an offering signifies the worshiper's active participation in the sacrificial system, which was central to Israelite worship. This system was established to maintain the covenant relationship between God and His people. The presentation of offerings was a tangible expression of faith and obedience, reflecting the worshiper's devotion and reverence for God. The requirement to present offerings underscores the importance of approaching God with intentionality and sincerity, a principle echoed in the New Testament where believers are encouraged to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>with cakes of leavened bread</b><br>Unlike most offerings, which required unleavened bread, the inclusion of leavened bread in the peace offering of thanksgiving is unique. Leaven, or yeast, typically symbolizes sin and corruption in biblical texts (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>). However, in this context, the use of leavened bread may represent the fullness and abundance of God's blessings, acknowledging that even in a fallen world, God's grace is sufficient. The presence of leavened bread in this offering highlights the comprehensive nature of thanksgiving, encompassing all aspects of life. This inclusion can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though sinless, took on the sin of the world to bring about reconciliation and peace (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God, including the instructions for offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom the laws and instructions for offerings were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable sanctuary where the Israelites worshiped God and performed sacrifices during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Levitical system, symbolizing fellowship and thanksgiving to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leavened_bread.htm">Leavened Bread</a></b><br>Bread made with yeast, which is unusual in offerings as most were unleavened, symbolizing the inclusion of everyday life in worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_leaven.htm">Symbolism of Leaven</a></b><br>While leaven often symbolizes sin, its inclusion here represents the fullness of life and the everyday aspects of human experience being offered to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/thanksgiving_in_worship.htm">Thanksgiving in Worship</a></b><br>The peace offering of thanksgiving emphasizes the importance of gratitude in our relationship with God.

In the New Testament, believers likewise enjoy peace with God through Christ, &#8220;our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and respond &#8220;in everything give thanks&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is to present an offering</b><p>- The worshiper &#8220;is to present&#8221;&#8212;a personal, deliberate act. <a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a> reminds Israel not to appear before the Lord empty-handed.

The priest facilitated, but the worshiper&#8217;s heart and obedience remained central.<p>- The offering also provided for the priesthood (<a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>). God&#8217;s design intertwines worship, fellowship, and practical support for those who serve (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With cakes of leavened bread</b><p>- Grain offerings elsewhere were strictly unleavened (<a href="/leviticus/2-11.htm">Leviticus 2:11</a>), yet here leaven is commanded. The inclusion signals that this is not a sin offering&#8212;no symbol of corruption is being placed on the altar. Instead, the bread will be eaten, representing everyday, ordinary life permeated by gratitude.<p>- Two loaves were given to the priest as a &#8220;heave offering&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>), illustrating that even what seems common belongs first to God. <a href="/amos/4-5.htm">Amos 4:5</a> notes Israel&#8217;s practice of offering leavened bread with praise; the act was already familiar.<p>- Leaven can picture growth and gladness as well (<a href="/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a>). God welcomes a celebratory meal in His presence. Fellowship with Him is not austere; it is richly flavored by His goodness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/7-13.htm">Leviticus 7:13</a> teaches that thanksgiving is never silent; it takes tangible form. The worshiper, enjoying peace with God, personally brings both the sacrificial animal and leavened bread, sharing a festive meal that honors the Lord, supports His servants, and sanctifies daily life. In Christ, the ultimate peace offering, we continue the pattern&#8212;presenting ourselves and our resources with grateful hearts, confident that God delights in fellowship with His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Besides the cakes.</span>--That is, the thirty un leavened cakes which were made of half of the quantity of the flour brought by the offerer, as described in the previous verse, the ten leavened cakes made of the other half of the flour are to be brought.
