The act of consecrating land to the LORD was a voluntary dedication, reflecting a deep commitment to God. This practice is rooted in the understanding that the land ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). The consecration of land could be for religious purposes, such as supporting the temple or the priesthood. This act also reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where individuals are caretakers of God's creation.<p><b>then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for it</b><br>The valuation of the land was based on its agricultural potential, specifically the amount of seed needed to sow it. This method of valuation underscores the agrarian nature of Israelite society, where the productivity of the land was a primary measure of its value. It also reflects a fair and practical approach to determining worth, as the potential yield of the land would directly impact its economic value.<p><b>fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed</b><br>The use of shekels and barley seed as units of measurement provides insight into the economic and agricultural systems of ancient Israel. A shekel was a standard unit of currency, and barley was a staple crop, often used as a measure for other grains. The specific valuation of fifty shekels per homer indicates a standardized system for redeeming consecrated land, ensuring consistency and fairness. This valuation system also highlights the importance of barley in the diet and economy of the time, as well as the broader biblical principle of redemption, where something dedicated to God could be redeemed or bought back under certain conditions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom the field is consecrated.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>An Israelite who chooses to consecrate a part of his field to the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents a portion of land that is dedicated to God, reflecting the agricultural context of ancient Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shekels_of_silver.htm">Shekels of Silver</a></b><br>The currency used for the valuation of the consecrated field.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/homer_of_barley_seed.htm">Homer of Barley Seed</a></b><br>A unit of measure for the seed, indicating the size of the field being consecrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_and_commitment.htm">Consecration and Commitment</a></b><br>Dedicating a portion of one's resources to God is an act of worship and commitment.

Therefore, the priest would adjust the fifty-shekel valuation downward for years remaining until Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/27-18.htm">Leviticus 27:18</a>).

The guideline honors God&#8217;s ownership of the land, safeguards worship funding, and ensures no one is exploited.

(See <a href="/leviticus/27-22.htm" title="And if a man sanctify to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;">Leviticus 27:22</a>.) The words, <span class= "ital">some part </span>which are in italics, are implied in the Hebrew construction of these words. No man was allowed to vow the whole of his estates to the sanctuary, as he would thereby impoverish his own family.<p><span class= "bld">Thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">thy estimation shall be according to its seed, </span>that is, he is not to part with the field thus vowed for the sanctuary, but the priest is to value the area according to the quantity of seed required for sowing it.<p><span class= "bld">An homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span>--That is, if the piece of land which he vowed could properly be cropped with one homer, or five bushels and a half of barley seed, he is to value it at 6 9s. 2d. (See <a href="/leviticus/27-3.htm" title="And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 27:3</a>.) According to the authorities during the second Temple, these fifty shekels covered the value of the produce for the whole period of forty-nine years, that is, from one jubile year to another, so that a plot of land of the dimensions here described was estimated at a little more than one shekel per annum. The person who made the vow could, under these circumstances, always redeem it, as it would almost amount to a gift to let any stranger buy it at this price. The low value put upon it was evidently designed not to deprive the family of their means of subsistence, since the patrimonial estates were almost always the only source of their livelihood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In case a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession,</span> that <span class="accented">is</span>, of his hereditary lands, the redemption price is fixed by the quantity of seed required for sowing it. If it requires a homer, or five bushels and a half, of barley seed to crop it, the redemption price is fifty shekels, or &pound;6 9s. 2d., plus one-fifth, that is, &pound;7 15s., supposing that the vow had been made in the year succeeding the jubilee; but if the vow was made at any time after the jubile, the value of the previous harvests was deducted from this sum. The amount does not seem to have been paid in a lump sum, but by annual installments of one shekel and one-fifth of a shekel, equal to 3s. 1 1/5 d., each year. In case he had sold his interest in the field up to the approaching jubilee before making his vow, then no redemption was allowed; he paid nothing, but the field passed from him to the sanctuary at the jubilee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/27-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1501;
