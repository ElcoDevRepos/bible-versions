The "holy place" is likely the courtyard of the Tabernacle, where the priests were to consume these offerings. This requirement underscores the sanctity of the offerings and the holiness required of the priests. Eating in a holy place signifies the separation from the common and the profane, emphasizing the need for purity and reverence in worship. This practice foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the believer's body as a temple of the Holy Spirit, calling for holiness in all aspects of life (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>).<p><b>because it is your share and your sons&#8217; share of the food offerings to the LORD</b><br>The priests and their families were provided for through the offerings brought by the Israelites. This provision was a practical means of support, as the tribe of Levi did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). The food offerings symbolize the people's dedication to God, and the priests' consumption of these offerings represents their role as mediators between God and Israel. This sharing of the offerings points to the communal aspect of worship and the interdependence of the community of faith.<p><b>for this is what I have been commanded</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine authority behind the instructions given to the priests. The commands were not arbitrary but were given by God to Moses, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's word. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, illustrating the relationship between God and His people. The command also reflects the order and structure God established for worship, which is fulfilled in Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father and became the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The high priest and brother of Moses, responsible for the priestly duties and rituals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab_and_abihu.htm">Nadab and Abihu</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron who were struck down by God for offering unauthorized fire before the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites and the one who conveyed God's laws and commands to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The holy place where the Israelites worshiped and where the priests performed their duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_made_by_fire.htm">Offerings Made by Fire</a></b><br>Sacrifices presented to God, which were a central part of Israelite worship and priestly duties.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_in_service.htm">Holiness in Service</a></b><br>The command to eat in a holy place underscores the importance of maintaining holiness in our service to God.
