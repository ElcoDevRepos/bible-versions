Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, receives these commands to convey to Aaron. This highlights the importance of obedience to God's word, a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Tell your brother Aaron:</b><br>Aaron, the first high priest, is given specific instructions, emphasizing the unique role of the high priest in Israelite worship. This underscores the concept of priesthood and intercession, which is later fulfilled in the New Testament by Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>not to enter freely into the Most Holy Place:</b><br>The Most Holy Place, or Holy of Holies, was the innermost and most sacred area of the Tabernacle, where God's presence dwelt. Access was restricted to the high priest once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), symbolizing the separation between a holy God and sinful humanity. This foreshadows the tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion, granting believers direct access to God (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>).<p><b>behind the veil in front of the mercy seat on the ark:</b><br>The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, signifying the barrier between God and man due to sin. The mercy seat, atop the Ark of the Covenant, was where atonement was made. This prefigures Christ's role as the propitiation for sin (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), where His sacrifice allows for reconciliation with God.<p><b>or else he will die:</b><br>The severe consequence for unauthorized entry underscores the holiness of God and the seriousness of approaching Him improperly. This serves as a warning of the consequences of sin and the need for reverence in worship. It also points to the necessity of Christ's atoning work, which allows believers to approach God with confidence (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><b>because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat:</b><br>The cloud represents God's presence and glory, often associated with divine revelation and guidance (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).

As Aaron here stands for all those who in future are to succeed him in the pontificate, so Moses, who teaches him his duty, stands for his successors who are hereafter to impart instruction to the high priests on these most solemn occasions. Hence during the second Temple the tuition and preparation of the high priest for his functions devolved upon the Sanhedrin, who prescribed most minute rules for his guidance. Seven days before the Day of Atonement he was separated from his wife, and lodged in a chamber in the Temple, lest he should contract defilement, which might unfit him for the performance of his pontifical duties. The elders or the representatives of the Sanhedrin read and expounded to him the ordinances contained in this chapter; which he had to practise in their [presence, so as to make sure that he could rightly perform all the ceremonies. This continued during the whole night previous to the Day of Atonement, when he was kept awake, so as to prevent any pollution arising from a dream or accident by night.<p>He read, in the silent hours of darkness, the Books of Job, Daniel, Ezra, and Chronicles; and if he was no scholar, and could not read, the elders read them to him. As it was deemed important that he should not fall asleep, the priests who surrounded him alternately snapped their fingers, and made him walk on the cold pavement of the court. When the chief of the thirteen priests who were appointed to perform the ordinary duties in connection with the service in the sanctuary had ascertained that the morning had dawned, that the ashes had been removed from the brazen altar, and that the time of the early sacrifice had arrived, the high priest was conducted to the baptistery, where he immersed his whole body in water.<p><span class= "bld">Into the holy place.</span>--This is here more minutely defined by "within the vail," thus showing that the Holy of Holies is meant. In the succeeding portions of this chapter, however, the expression "holy" is used for "Holy of Holies" without this adjunct. (See <a href="/leviticus/16-3.htm" title="Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.">Leviticus 16:3</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/16-16.htm" title="And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remains among them in the middle of their uncleanness.">Leviticus 16:16-17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-20.htm" title="And when he has made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:">Leviticus 16:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm" title="And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.">Leviticus 16:27</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark.</span>--Or, according to the accents of the received text, <span class= "ital">nor come to the mercy seat, which, </span>&c. The present text exhibits the view of the Pharisees--that the high priest, though at some distance from the ark, is yet hid through the frankincense on the burning coals in the Holy of Holies itself (see <a href="/context/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>); whilst the Sadducees maintained that he must put it <span class= "ital">on </span>the coals already in the court, because they deemed it improper to work in the presence of the Lord, and because the pontiff would otherwise see the ark. The Authorised Version, therefore, here, as elsewhere, follows the view of the Sadducees, and departs from the received accents, which are an essential part of the traditional text. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy</span> place <span class="cmt_word">within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark;</span> that he die not. Nadab and Abihu having died for their rash presumption in venturing unbidden into the tabernacle, it was natural that Aaron, who had as yet but once penetrated into the holy of holies, should be struck with fear, and that he should desire Divine instruction as to the times and manner in which he was to appear before the Lord, lest he should be struck dead like his sons. If the attempt to enter the outer chamber of the tabernacle had been so fatal to them, what might not be the result to him of entering <span class="accented">within the vail</span> which hung <span class="accented">before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark?</span> The mercy-seat <span class="accented">- capporeth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">propitiatorium -</span> formed the top of the ark, and was the place where God specially exhibited his Presence, on the occasions of his manifestation, by the bright <span class="accented">cloud</span> which then rested upon it between the cherubim. It was this Presence which made it perilous for Aaron to appear within the vail unbidden or without the becoming ritual; for man might not meet God unless he were sanctified for the purpose (<a href="/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14, 21-24</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). The words, for <span class="cmt_word">I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat,</span> refer to the Divine Presence thus visibly manifested (see <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-12</a>), and not, as they have strangely been misinterpreted, to the cloud of smoke raised by the incense burnt by the high priest on his entrance. They do not, however, prove that the manifestation was constantly there, still less that it was continued, according to Jewish tradition, in later times. "The reason for the prohibition of Aaron's entrance at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, is to be found in the fact that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties; and so long as the Law, which produced only the knowledge of sin, and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand" (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/16-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
