The altar, located in the Tabernacle's courtyard, was the designated place for sacrifices, symbolizing God's presence and the need for atonement. This act of bringing the offering to the altar signifies the approach to God, emphasizing the need for a mediator, which foreshadows Christ as our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>twist off its head</b><br>This phrase describes the specific method of sacrifice for a bird offering, which was typically a turtledove or young pigeon. The act of twisting off the head was a practical method for a small animal and highlights the seriousness of sin requiring a life to be given. This act can be seen as a type of Christ's sacrifice, where His life was given for the atonement of sin (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><b>and burn it on the altar</b><br>Burning the offering on the altar was a way to transform the physical sacrifice into a pleasing aroma to the Lord, symbolizing complete dedication and surrender to God. This act of burning represents the total consumption of the offering, pointing to the totality of Christ's sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar</b><br>The draining of blood is significant as blood represents life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). The act of pouring it out on the altar's side signifies the offering of life to God and the cleansing power of the sacrifice. This prefigures the shedding of Christ's blood, which is essential for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The side of the altar, where the blood was poured, can be seen as a place of purification and sanctification, pointing to the cleansing power of Jesus' blood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priest.htm">Priest</a></b><br>The priest is the mediator between God and the people, responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals as prescribed in the Law of Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where sacrifices are offered to God.

The imposition of hands upon the victim was dispensed with, both because the bird was too small for this ceremony, and because the offerer brought it in his hands to the place of sacrifice, thus conveying by this act the idea involved in the imposition of hands.<p><span class= "bld">And wring off his head.</span>--When the bird is handed to him, the priest is not to use any knife, but is to nip off its head with his nails, throw the severed head on the altar fire, and thus cause it to ascend in the sweet smelling savour. As the small quantity of blood could not be caught in a bowl, and would not suffice for throwing it or pouring it on the four walls, as was the case in the offering of quadrupeds, he pressed it out from the headless body, and let it run on the walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/leviticus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest shall bring it unto the altar</span>.
