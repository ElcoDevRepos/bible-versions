These actions are not only personal sins but also have communal implications, as they defile the land and the people. The use of "therefore" connects this command to the previous instructions, emphasizing the seriousness of adhering to God's laws. The concept of abominations is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>, where similar practices are condemned. The severity of these actions is underscored by their potential to lead the entire community away from holiness.<p><b>must be cut off from among his people</b><br>Being "cut off" implies a severe form of punishment, which could mean excommunication, banishment, or even death, depending on the context and the specific transgression. This phrase underscores the importance of maintaining the purity and holiness of the community, as the presence of sin could bring judgment upon the entire nation. The idea of being cut off is also seen in <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> regarding the covenant of circumcision, where failure to comply results in being cut off from the covenant community. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from sin and the necessity of holiness among God's people. The ultimate fulfillment of this principle is found in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ provides a way for reconciliation and restoration for those who repent and turn away from their sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who received the laws from God on Mount Sinai, including the laws in Leviticus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the laws to set them apart from other nations and to maintain holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, where the practices mentioned in <a href="/bsb/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> were prevalent among the inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver who establishes moral and ceremonial laws for His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the laws from God, including the instructions found in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and separate from the sinful practices of the world.
