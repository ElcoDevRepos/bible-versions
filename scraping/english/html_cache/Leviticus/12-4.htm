The number thirty-three is specific to the birth of a male child, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/12.htm">Leviticus 12</a>. This period of purification reflects the cultural and religious practices of the time, emphasizing the importance of ritual cleanliness. The number thirty-three may symbolize completeness and order, as seen in other biblical contexts. This purification process underscores the holiness required to approach God, highlighting the separation between the sacred and the profane. It also points to the need for spiritual cleansing, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament through the atoning work of Jesus Christ, who provides ultimate purification from sin.<p><b>She must not touch anything sacred or go into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are complete.</b><br>This restriction emphasizes the sanctity of the sacred objects and spaces within the Israelite community. The prohibition against touching sacred things or entering the sanctuary underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity when approaching Him. This separation serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and the need for atonement. The sanctuary, being the dwelling place of God's presence, required those who entered to be ceremonially clean. This regulation foreshadows the New Testament teaching that believers are temples of the Holy Spirit, called to live lives of holiness. It also points to Jesus Christ, who, through His sacrifice, grants believers access to God, breaking down the barriers of impurity and sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

days</b><p>God sets a defined, measurable period&#8212;thirty-three days&#8212;after childbirth for the mother&#8217;s continued cleansing.<p>&#8226; This is not about moral guilt; it is ritual impurity that prevents ordinary life from mingling with holy space (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The specificity underlines the Lord&#8217;s care for order and health, giving the mother time to recover while symbolically acknowledging that life and blood belong to Him (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; When Mary observed these same days after Jesus&#8217; birth (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>), it showed that even the Messiah&#8217;s family honored God&#8217;s established pattern.<p>&#8226; The total forty days (seven

reserved for priests (<a href="/leviticus/22-2.htm">Leviticus 22:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The restriction reminds Israel that holiness is God-defined, not self-defined (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Today, we recognize that Christ&#8217;s finished work allows us to &#8220;draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean&#8221; (<a

represented God&#8217;s dwelling among His people; impurity could disrupt that fellowship (<a href="/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By staying outside, the mother affirmed the boundary between divine perfection and human frailty, a boundary Christ would bridge (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern also granted her rest from regular

These sacrifices restored full participation in covenant life and expressed gratitude for God&#8217;s gift of a child.<p>&#8226; The closure reinforces that God&#8217;s commands have a purpose and an end point, leading to restored fellowship (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, Jesus fulfills every purification requirement once for all (<a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>).

The verse teaches reverence for God&#8217;s presence, the seriousness of approaching the holy, and the joy of restored fellowship&#8212;realities ultimately fulfilled for us in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/leviticus/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Continue in the blood of her purifying.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">continue in the blood of purification, </span>that is, <span class= "ital">pure blood. </span>Though the discharge consequent upon the birth ceases after two or three weeks, the period in this case, as in the former instance, is nearly doubled, to include exceptional cases. During these thirty-three days, which constituted the second stage, the mother was only debarred from touching holy things, such as first tithes, the flesh of thank- and peace-offerings, &c, and from entering the sanctuary. Having bathed at the end of the seven days which constituted the first and defiling period, she could now partake of the second tithes, and resume conjugal intercourse, since any blood that might now appear was regarded as <span class= "ital">pure blood, </span>in contradistinction to the (<span class= "ital">dam nidah</span>) blood of monthly courses. Her proximity, therefore, no longer defiled. The Sadducees and the Samaritans during the second Temple, and their followers, the Karaite Jews, interpreted this law more rigidly. Though admitting that there is a difference of degree in the two periods, they maintained that the woman was too unclean for conjugal intercourse even during the second period. They therefore pointed the text differently so as to yield the rendering "blood of <span class= "ital">her </span>purifying." The Authorised Version, which, in this instance, follows the opinion of the Sadducees, departs from the received text.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/leviticus/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The woman shall continue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#234;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in purification</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;ho&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2893.htm">Strong's 2893: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ceremonial purification, moral purity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from her bleeding</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7695;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
