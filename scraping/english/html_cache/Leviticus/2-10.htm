It typically consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense. The "remainder" refers to what is left after a portion is burned on the altar as a memorial offering. This offering symbolizes the fruit of human labor and the dedication of one's sustenance to God, reflecting the principle that all provision comes from Him.<p><b>shall belong to Aaron and his sons;</b><br>Aaron and his sons, the priests, were set apart to serve in the tabernacle, and they did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. Instead, they were provided for through the offerings of the people. This provision underscores the principle of supporting those who minister in spiritual matters, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>, where Paul draws a parallel between the Old Testament priesthood and those who preach the gospel.<p><b>it is a most holy part</b><br>The designation "most holy" indicates a higher level of sanctity. In the Levitical system, certain offerings were considered "most holy," meaning they were to be handled with great reverence and consumed only by the priests in a holy place. This reflects the seriousness with which God views offerings made to Him and the holiness required of those who serve Him.<p><b>of the food offerings</b><br>Food offerings, or "sacrifices," were a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing fellowship with God and dependence on His provision. They included various types of offerings, such as burnt offerings, peace offerings, and sin offerings. Each had specific regulations and purposes, reflecting different aspects of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>to the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "to the LORD" emphasizes that the offerings were ultimately directed to God, not merely as a ritual but as an act of worship and obedience. This reflects the broader biblical theme that all acts of worship and service are to be done for the glory of God, as seen in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>. The offerings foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself "once for all" (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>), fulfilling the sacrificial system and establishing a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
