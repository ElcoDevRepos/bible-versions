This priesthood was established to mediate between God and the people, highlighting the importance of holiness and obedience in worship. Aaron, as the first high priest, represents a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). His sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, were also consecrated for this sacred duty, emphasizing the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood.<p><b>did everything</b><br>This phrase underscores the complete obedience required in the priestly service. The meticulous adherence to God's commands reflects the seriousness of their role and the need for purity and precision in worship. This obedience is a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to follow Christ's commands (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>the LORD had commanded</b><br>The commands given by the LORD were specific and detailed, as seen throughout Leviticus. These instructions were not merely ritualistic but were designed to set Israel apart as a holy nation. The emphasis on divine command highlights God's sovereignty and the necessity of following His will precisely, which is a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32-33</a>).<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses served as the mediator between God and Israel, receiving the law and instructions directly from God. His role as a prophet and leader is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>). Moses' faithfulness in conveying God's commands is a model of leadership and obedience for all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses, appointed as the first high priest of Israel.

It signals certainty: what God initiates, He brings to completion (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> applies this principle universally).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron and his sons</b><p>The verse specifies, &#8220;Aaron and his sons,&#8221; the newly appointed priestly family (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unique calling: set apart from the tribe of Levi to serve as mediators (<a href="/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their representational role: they stand for the whole nation before a holy God, foreshadowing our Great High Priest, Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their accountability: because of their privileged office, later infractions (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>) show the seriousness of obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did everything</b><p>The text continues, &#8220;did everything&#8230;.&#8221; Scripture frequently highlights total obedience:<p>&#8226; Noah &#8220;did everything that God commanded&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>), showing saving faith acts in full compliance.<p>&#8226; The craftsmen of the tabernacle &#8220;did all that the LORD had commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42-43</a>), illustrating worship must align with revelation, not innovation.<p>&#8226; Here, meticulous obedience qualifies Aaron&#8217;s family for ministry, pointing to the believer&#8217;s call to &#8220;be doers of the word&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD had commanded</b><p>The standard is not public opinion or priestly creativity;

(<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-6</a>). The favor experienced in <a href="/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23-24</a> (fire from heaven) directly ties back to this obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through Moses</b><p>Finally, obedience comes &#8220;through Moses,&#8221; God&#8217;s chosen mediator of revelation.<p>&#8226; The pattern: &#8220;Then Moses told the Israelites everything the LORD had said&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-32.htm">Exodus 34:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle: God uses human instruments without diluting His authority (<a href="/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a> calls Moses the one who &#8220;received living words to pass on to us&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The progression: &#8220;For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>). Moses points forward to the ultimate Mediator, but his role underscores that divine truth is delivered in understandable, historical contexts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/leviticus/8-36.htm">Leviticus 8:36</a> affirms that the newly ordained priests responded with full, unquestioning obedience to every detail God transmitted through Moses.
