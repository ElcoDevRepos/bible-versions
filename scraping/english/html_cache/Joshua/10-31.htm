Joshua, as the appointed leader after Moses, is fulfilling God's command to conquer the Promised Land. The phrase "all Israel with him" indicates the participation of the entire nation, highlighting the communal nature of their mission. This unity is crucial for the success of their military campaigns and reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience and collective action are key themes.<p><b>moved on from Libnah to Lachish</b><br>Libnah and Lachish were both significant Canaanite cities. Libnah, meaning "whiteness," was a royal city in the Shephelah region, and its capture is part of the southern campaign. Lachish, another important city, was strategically located and heavily fortified, making it a critical target for Israel's conquest. Archaeological excavations at Lachish have uncovered evidence of its destruction, aligning with the biblical account. The movement from Libnah to Lachish signifies the systematic approach of Joshua's campaign, as they move from one city to the next, ensuring the complete subjugation of the land.<p><b>They laid siege to it</b><br>Siege warfare was a common military tactic in the ancient Near East, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. The Israelites' ability to lay siege indicates their growing military prowess and God's favor in granting them victory. This methodical approach to warfare demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>, where God commands the destruction of the Canaanite nations.<p><b>and fought against it</b><br>The phrase underscores the active engagement in battle, reflecting the Israelites' obedience to God's command to take possession of the land. The fight against Lachish is part of the broader narrative of conquest, where each victory is attributed to divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises. The battles serve as a testament to God's faithfulness and the importance of Israel's reliance on Him for success. The conquest of Lachish, like other cities, is a precursor to the eventual establishment of Israel in the land, foreshadowing the ultimate rest and inheritance promised to God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.
