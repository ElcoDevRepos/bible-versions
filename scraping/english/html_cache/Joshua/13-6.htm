The hill country of Lebanon was known for its cedar trees, often used in construction, including the temple built by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The mention of Misrephoth-maim, though its exact location is uncertain, suggests a boundary area that was significant in the conquest narratives. This region was part of the land promised to the Israelites, highlighting the extent of the territory God intended for them to possess.<p><b>all the Sidonians</b><br>The Sidonians were the inhabitants of Sidon, a prominent Phoenician city-state known for its trade and maritime prowess. Sidon, along with Tyre, was a center of commerce and culture in the ancient Near East. The Sidonians were known for their worship of Baal and other deities, which often led Israel into idolatry (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>). The inclusion of the Sidonians in this passage underscores the challenge Israel faced in maintaining religious purity amidst surrounding pagan influences.<p><b>I Myself will drive out before the Israelites</b><br>This promise of divine intervention emphasizes God's role in the conquest of Canaan. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where God acts as the divine warrior on behalf of His people (<a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30</a>). This assurance of God's active involvement is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives, reinforcing the idea that victory is achieved not by human might but by divine power (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><b>Be sure to divide it by lot as an inheritance to Israel</b><br>The division of the land by lot was a method used to ensure fairness and divine guidance in the allocation of territories among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>). This practice underscores the belief that God is sovereign over the distribution of the land, and it fulfills the promise made to the patriarchs regarding the inheritance of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The use of lots also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where casting lots was a common means of decision-making.<p><b>as I have commanded you</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands. The division of the land was not merely a practical necessity but a divine mandate. It reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience as a response to God's covenantal promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The command to divide the land also points to the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reinforcing the continuity of God's plan throughout Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country.htm">Hill Country</a></b><br>This refers to the elevated regions in the land of Canaan, which were inhabited by various groups that God promised to drive out before the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region north of Israel known for its cedar trees, representing the northern boundary of the land God promised to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/misrephoth-maim.htm">Misrephoth-maim</a></b><br>A location mentioned as part of the boundary of the land to be conquered, though its exact location is uncertain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sidonians.htm">Sidonians</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Sidon, a prominent city in ancient Phoenicia, known for their seafaring and trade.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, chosen by God to inherit the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_promise_and_assurance.htm">Divine Promise and Assurance</a></b><br>God assures Joshua that He will drive out the inhabitants, emphasizing His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.
