This practice is rooted in the belief that God controls the outcome of the lot (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The use of lots is seen throughout the Old Testament, including the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-24</a>) and the division of land in <a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>.<p><b>for the clans of the tribe of Naphtali:</b><br>Naphtali was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant (<a href="/genesis/30-7.htm">Genesis 30:7-8</a>). The tribe's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, a region known for its fertile land and strategic location. This area included the Sea of Galilee and extended to the borders of modern-day Lebanon. Historically, Naphtali's land was significant for trade and military routes, making it a target for various conquests. In the New Testament, this region is where Jesus conducted much of His ministry, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah.
