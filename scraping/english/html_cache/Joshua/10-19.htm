In the context of Joshua's military campaign, it underscores the importance of not becoming complacent after initial victories. This reflects a broader biblical principle seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>, where believers are encouraged to press on toward their spiritual goals.<p><b>Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind.</b><br>The strategy of pursuing and attacking from behind suggests a tactical advantage, ensuring the enemy is caught off guard and unable to regroup. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God granting wisdom and strategy to His people, as seen in David's battles (<a href="/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23-25</a>). It also highlights the importance of following divine guidance in spiritual warfare, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>Do not let them reach their cities,</b><br>Preventing the enemies from reaching their cities was crucial to avoid them regrouping and fortifying themselves. This reflects the biblical principle of cutting off sin at its source, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>, where Jesus speaks about removing anything that causes one to stumble. It also illustrates the need for decisive action in spiritual battles.<p><b>for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises. It echoes the assurance given to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>, where God promises to be with him as He was with Moses. This assurance of victory is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting God's faithfulness and the certainty of His promises, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, which states that if God is for us, who can be against us?<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, who is leading the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, following Joshua's leadership in the conquest of the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>A coalition of five Amorite kings who have come against Gibeon, an ally of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A city that made a treaty with Israel and is under attack by the Amorite kings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is actively involved in delivering the enemies into the hands of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battle.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battle</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate deliverer in our battles, both physical and spiritual.
