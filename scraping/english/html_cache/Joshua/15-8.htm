From these passages we may gather a confirmation of the view above expressed, that the valley here meant is an open valley, since only in such a valley could the Philistine army take up a position. It gradually narrows towards the southwest. On the south it extends as far as Bethlehem. The range of mountains which lie to the west of the valley of Hinnom from the northern boundary of the plain or valley of Rephaim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/15-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From there the border</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
