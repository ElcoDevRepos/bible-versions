The name "Tappuah" means "apple" in Hebrew, indicating a region possibly known for its fruitfulness. This city is mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in <a href="/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8</a>, where it is associated with the land of Manasseh. The dual mention highlights the shared boundaries and the cooperative relationship between the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, both descendants of Joseph.<p><b>the border went westward</b><br>The direction westward indicates the movement of the boundary line from an inland location towards the Mediterranean Sea. This westward expansion signifies the allocation of fertile and strategically important land to the tribe of Ephraim. The westward movement also reflects the biblical theme of expansion and inheritance, as seen in God's promises to the patriarchs about the land of Canaan.<p><b>to the Brook of Kanah</b><br>The Brook of Kanah served as a natural boundary marker. It is identified with the modern Wadi Qana, a seasonal stream that flows through the central hill country of Israel. The brook's name, meaning "reed" or "stalk," suggests a lush, vegetative area. This geographical feature provided a clear demarcation line for the tribal territories, emphasizing the importance of natural landmarks in ancient boundary descriptions.<p><b>and ended at the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the land allotted to Ephraim. This access to the sea was significant for trade and military purposes, offering Ephraim economic opportunities and strategic advantages. The sea's mention underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel a land stretching from the desert to the sea, as seen in <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>.<p><b>This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Ephraim</b><br>The term "inheritance" reflects the biblical concept of land as a divine gift, passed down through generations. Ephraim, one of the two sons of Joseph, received a prominent portion of the Promised Land, fulfilling Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Ephraim was prophesied to become a "multitude of nations." The division among "clans" indicates the organized distribution of land within the tribe, ensuring each family received its rightful share.
