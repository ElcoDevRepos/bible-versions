Joshua's role as a leader is significant, as he is seen as a type of Christ, leading God's people into the Promised Land. His leadership is marked by obedience to God's commands, which is a central theme in the book of Joshua.<p><b>Advance and march around the city</b><br>The city in question is Jericho, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, located in the Jordan Valley. The command to march around the city is part of a divine strategy for conquest, emphasizing faith and obedience over military might. This act of marching is symbolic of God's people claiming His promises through faith.<p><b>with the armed troops going ahead</b><br>The presence of armed troops signifies the readiness for battle, yet the battle plan is unconventional, highlighting reliance on God's power rather than human strength. This mirrors the spiritual battles believers face, where reliance on God is paramount.<p><b>of the ark of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant represents God's presence among His people. It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, symbolizing God's covenant, authority, and provision. The ark leading the procession underscores the centrality of God's presence and guidance in achieving victory.

The ark is the vessel that contains it. The armed men that precede it are its executioners. The priests who blow the trumpets are its heralds. It was this law that had brought Israel over Jordan; this law that was henceforth to be established in Canaan; this law that was about to take vengeance on the transgressors. The whole law of Moses is but the expansion of the Decalogue; and the Pentateuch contains an ample statement of the transgressions which had brought the inhabitants of Canaan under the ban of the Divine law. The seven days' march round Jericho, in absolute silence, was well calculated to impress on the inhabitants the lesson of "the forbearance of God." "These things hast thou done, and I kept silence." For several generations the long-suffering of God had waited, while "the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full." In the first year of the Exodus He had threatened them, bringing the sword of Israel to their borders; and then He had drawn back His hand from them, and given them forty years' respite more. But now the long-suffering of God had waited long enough. The shout that burst from the lips of Israel was a signal that He would wait no longer.<p>Looked at thus, the shout of Israel at the sound of the trumpet on the seventh day becomes no inapt figure of that which is connected with it by the language of Holy Scripture--"the shout," accompanied by "the voice of the archangel and the trump of God," which shall notify to the world our Lord's second coming. "Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence" any more (Ps. 1. 3 and 21; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said.</span> The text has <span class="accented">they said.</span> Our translators follow the Masoretic emendation.
