This area was characterized by its elevated flatlands, making it suitable for settlement and agriculture. The cities here were part of the territory allocated to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. This region was significant for its strategic location and fertile land.<p><b>and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites</b><br>Sihon was a powerful Amorite king whose kingdom extended over a large area east of the Jordan. The Amorites were a prominent Canaanite people known for their fortified cities and military strength. The defeat of Sihon by the Israelites under Moses' leadership was a pivotal moment in Israel's conquest of the Promised Land, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>who reigned in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon's kingdom. It was strategically located and became a significant city for the Israelites after its conquest. The city is often mentioned in biblical poetry and prophecy, symbolizing victory over formidable enemies (e.g., <a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26-30</a>).<p><b>until Moses killed him</b><br>The defeat of Sihon by Moses is recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-24</a>. This victory was crucial for the Israelites as it opened the way for their entry into Canaan. It also served as a testament to God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and the chiefs of Midian (Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba)</b><br>These Midianite chiefs were allied with Sihon and were defeated by the Israelites as recorded in <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>. The Midianites were a nomadic people often in conflict with Israel. Their defeat was part of God's judgment against them for leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25).<p><b>the princes of Sihon who lived in the land</b><br>These princes were likely local rulers or governors under Sihon's authority. Their mention highlights the comprehensive nature of Israel's victory, as not only the king but also his subordinates were defeated. This ensured the complete transfer of power and territory to the Israelites, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_the_amorites.htm">Sihon, King of the Amorites</a></b><br>Sihon was a powerful Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon.

He was giving tangible land, not merely spiritual concepts. Cross-references such as <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-17</a> and <a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a> show that the plateau (or &#8220;tableland&#8221;) east of the Jordan was a fertile, elevated region already subdued under Moses&#8217; leadership (<a href="/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32-35</a>). By naming every city, Scripture underscores that nothing promised was withheld&#8212;every location was literally transferred to Israel&#8217;s tribes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites</b><p>The text moves from the cities to &#8220;all the kingdom.&#8221; Sihon&#8217;s realm once stretched across a broad swath of Transjordan (<a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). Declaring its complete inclusion testifies that God&#8217;s victory was total, not partial. <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a> later celebrates this conquest as proof of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, and the phrase here ties the land division back to that decisive triumph.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who reigned in Heshbon</b><p>Heshbon was Sihon&#8217;s capital (<a href="/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>). By naming the city, Scripture ties the historical narrative to a verifiable place. It also underscores the reversal of power: the very throne from which Israel had been denied passage (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-23</a>) is now vacant and reassigned. The inclusion of Heshbon assures every reader that God&#8217;s justice addressed not only territory but the oppressive seat of Amorite rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until Moses killed him</b><p>The line &#8220;until Moses killed him&#8221; anchors the account in a real moment (<a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). It reminds the reader that leadership under Moses, acting in obedience, brought about this victory. God&#8217;s word had declared judgment on the Amorites (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>), and here that word is fulfilled precisely. The verse links past obedience to present inheritance: what Moses conquered, Joshua now distributes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the chiefs of Midian (Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba)</b><p>The Midianite chiefs listed in <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a> had allied with Sihon or at least occupied his former territory. Their defeat under Moses eliminated lingering threats. By name-checking Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the text shows that every level of hostile leadership&#8212;king and chiefs alike&#8212;was removed. It also echoes the cautionary tale of Balaam (<a href="/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>), since Midian had enticed Israel into sin; God&#8217;s judgment was thorough.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The princes of Sihon who lived in the land</b><p>Finally, the verse notes &#8220;the princes of Sihon who lived in the land,&#8221; signaling that Sihon&#8217;s vassals or district rulers were also subdued. <a href="/psalms/136-17.htm">Psalm 136:17-22</a> recounts this sweeping victory, crediting the Lord&#8217;s enduring love. By repeating that they &#8220;lived in the land,&#8221; Scripture emphasizes permanence: these weren&#8217;t foreign dignitaries but resident authorities. Their removal cleared the way for settled inheritance by the tribes of Reuben and Gad (<a href="/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a> catalogs, phrase by phrase, the totality of God&#8217;s earlier victories that now become Israel&#8217;s inheritance: every city on the plateau, the whole Amorite kingdom under Sihon, his capital Heshbon, the king himself, allied Midianite chiefs, and local princes&#8212;all gone, all conquered. The verse answers, &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; by declaring that God literally fulfilled His word, removed every obstacle, and handed His people every square mile He&#8217;d promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The princes of Midian . . . which were dukes of Sinon, dwelling in the country.</span>--<p>The conquest of the Midianites is recorded in Numbers 31. The orders given were, "Avenge the Lord of Midian" (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a>); "avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites" (<a href="/joshua/13-2.htm" title="This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,">Joshua 13:2</a>), because they tempted Israel to idolatry and uncleanness. But this verse in Joshua supplies us with a further reason for hostilities between Midian and Israel. The Midianites were "dukes of Sihon," and a part of his government. Through them he appears to have exercised his dominion over the conquered territory which he had taken from Moab. This land Israel had now, in turn, taken from him. But in order to its complete subjugation, the removal of Sihon's dukes, the princes or kings of Midian, was also necessary. This was brought about in the manner described in Numbers 22-25, , 31. The relation between Midian and Moab which is <span class= "ital">implied, </span>but not explained in Numbers, is explained by the apparently casual remark in this place. It is another example of undesigned agreement between Joshua and the Pentateuch. Of the same kind is the allusion to Balaam, as (<a href="/joshua/13-22.htm" title="Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.">Joshua 13:22</a>) <span class= "ital">the soothsayer, </span>or <span class= "ital">diviner. </span>In Numbers we do not read of anything but prophecy and counsel as coming from Balaam's lips; but it is abundantly evident, from hints scattered through the story, that he was a <span class= "ital">sooth-sayer, </span>or <span class= "ital">diviner, </span>as well as a prophet. The elders of Moab and Midian went to him with the reward of <span class= "ital">divination </span>in their hands (<a href="/numbers/22-7.htm" title="And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.">Numbers 22:7</a>); "Neither is there any <span class= "ital">divination </span>against Israel" (<a href="/numbers/23-23.htm" title="Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God worked!">Numbers 23:23</a>) the word in each of these places is radically connected with the epithet applied to Balaam here. (Comp. <a href="/numbers/24-1.htm" title="And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.">Numbers 24:1</a> : "He went not, <span class= "ital">as at other times, </span>to seek for <span class= "ital">enchantments"</span>--where a different word is employed.) He is thus shown to have been an unscrupulous man, who, if he could not obtain the knowledge that he desired from above, would not hesitate to seek it from below, that he might secure his base gain. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cities of the plain.</span> "Mishor" once more. See above, ver. 9, not as in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">Ciccar.</span> These, therefore, were not Sodom and its neighbours, but cities of the Amorites. Such touches as this, which display the minute acquaintance of our author with his subject, are almost of a necessity lost in a translation. But where our version has "plain," the original has Mishor when the uplands of Gilead and Bashan are meant, Arabah when the writer is speaking of the Wadys in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, Shephelah when he refers to the lowlands of Western palestine, bordering on the Mediterranean, Bik'ah when he speaks of the great valley of Coele Syria, Ciccar when he speaks of the territory due north of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">With the princes of Midian.</span> The word here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> signifies <span class="accented">exalted persons</span>, persons of rank, as we should say. It would seem to imply rather civil functions than the more absolute authority which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> also rendered "prince" in Hebrew, carries with it. With this passage compare <a href="/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>. The Hebrew has no "with," so that the difficulty some have found in the passage need not have arisen. It is nowhere said that Moses smote the "princes of Midian" together with Sihon. All that is stated is that they, as well as Sihon, were smitten, as the history in Numbers tells us they were. Dukes of Sihon. According to Gesenius, Rosenmiiller, and others, the word here translated "dukes" is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">to pour out</span>, means "anointed." See Psalm if. 6, where it is translated "set." But Keil rejects this interpretation, and says that the word never signifies to anoint. It is always used, he says, of <span class="accented">foreign</span> princes. But he has overlooked <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> (Hebrews). See Knobel, who explains it of drink offerings, and regards these "dukes" as men pledged by a solemn treaty to be Sihon's allies, though not vassals. Kimchi thinks that Sihon, before his reverses at the hand of Israel, had held some authority in Midian, and these were his prefects, or under-kings. The term is applied to Zebah and Zalmunna in <a href="/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> (in the Hebrew). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
