This act of deception can be seen as a reflection of the broader spiritual battle between truth and falsehood. In the biblical narrative, deception often leads to significant consequences, as seen in the story of Jacob and Esau (Genesis 27) and the serpent's deception of Eve (Genesis 3). The Gibeonites' actions also underscore the importance of discernment and seeking God's guidance, as Joshua and the Israelites failed to consult the Lord before making a treaty with them.<p><b>and set out as envoys</b><br>The Gibeonites presented themselves as ambassadors, a role that typically involved diplomacy and negotiation. In the ancient Near East, envoys were often sent to establish peace treaties or alliances. This action by the Gibeonites was strategic, as they sought to secure a covenant with Israel to avoid destruction. The use of envoys in this context emphasizes the importance of appearances and the role of diplomacy in ancient times. It also serves as a reminder of the need for wisdom and discernment in dealing with others, as appearances can be deceiving.<p><b>carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks</b><br>The mention of donkeys and worn-out sacks adds a layer of authenticity to the Gibeonites' ruse. Donkeys were common pack animals in the ancient world, used for transporting goods over long distances. The worn-out sacks suggest a long journey, reinforcing the Gibeonites' claim of coming from a distant land. This detail highlights the lengths to which the Gibeonites went to make their deception believable. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the outward appearance versus inward reality, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God reminds Samuel that He looks at the heart, not the outward appearance.<p><b>and old wineskins, cracked and mended</b><br>Wineskins were used to store and transport wine, and over time, they would become brittle and crack. The Gibeonites' use of old, mended wineskins was another element of their deception, suggesting that they had traveled a great distance. This imagery of old wineskins is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus uses the metaphor of new wine in old wineskins (<a href="/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>) to illustrate the incompatibility of the new covenant with old religious practices. The cracked and mended wineskins in <a href="/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a> serve as a physical representation of the Gibeonites' attempt to manipulate appearances to achieve their goals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the city of Gibeon who, fearing the Israelites, resorted to deception to secure a peace treaty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land and conquering its inhabitants.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were commanded to take possession of the Promised Land and eliminate its idolatrous inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites, inhabited by various groups, including the Gibeonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deception.htm">Deception</a></b><br>The act carried out by the Gibeonites to protect themselves from destruction by the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders must seek God's guidance in decision-making to avoid being deceived by appearances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_deception.htm">Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deception can lead to unintended long-term consequences, as seen in the covenant with the Gibeonites.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human deception, God's plans and purposes prevail, as He used the Gibeonites for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/importance_of_seeking_god.htm">Importance of Seeking God</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure to consult God before making a treaty with the Gibeonites serves as a reminder to seek divine guidance in all decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_relationships.htm">Integrity in Relationships</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to maintain integrity and honesty in their dealings with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_9_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 9:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_detect_deception_like_Israel_failed.htm">How can we discern deception like the Israelites failed in Joshua 9:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_God_s_guidance_in_Joshua_9.htm">What role does seeking God's guidance play in decision-making, as seen in Joshua 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_9_4_Eph_6_11_warfare.htm">How does Joshua 9:4 connect with Ephesians 6:11 about spiritual warfare?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_being_fooled_by_appearances.htm">What practical steps can prevent us from being deceived by appearances today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_9_4_Pray_before_agreements.htm">How does Joshua 9:4 teach the importance of prayer before making agreements?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Gibeonites_deceive_Joshua.htm">Why did the Gibeonites resort to deception in Joshua 9:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_9_4_s_link_to_discernment.htm">How does Joshua 9:4 reflect on the theme of discernment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_9_4_Consequences_of_deceit.htm">What does Joshua 9:4 teach about the consequences of deceit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_were_israelites_deceived_by_appearances.htm">How could the Israelites be so easily deceived by mere outward appearances (Joshua 9:4&#8211;5)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_prophecy_have_dual_fulfillment.htm">What is Gibeon's significance in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_gibeon's_role_in_the_bible.htm">What is Gibeon's significance in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/jacob's_blessings_for_his_sons.htm">What are Jacob's prophetic blessings for his sons?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 9:4 Mean</div><b>Acted deceptively</b><p>The men of Gibeon made a conscious choice to trick Israel.

The verse underscores two timeless truths: deceit thrives when people rely on appearances, and God&#8217;s people must seek His counsel before making covenants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">They did work wilily.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and they </span>also <span class= "ital">dealt with subtilty. </span>The stratagem does not seem a very profound one, or one that would have been difficult to detect. But we may remember a fact of Israel's experience which puts it in a somewhat different light. The Israelites themselves had come from a far country, but their raiment had not "waxed old upon them," nor did "their feet swell," these forty years. Of bread they had no need, when there was manna, and God gave them water for their thirst. Of worn garments and stale provisions they had no experience, and therefore, when the Gibeonites presented themselves in this extraordinary garb and guise, it is not unnatural that they were not detected by the eyes of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">They . . . made as if they had been ambassadors.</span>--The verb thus translated does not occur elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. By the alteration of a letter, the Targum, LXX., and some other versions make it mean, "they gat them provision."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They did work wilily.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">and they worked - they also - with craft.</span> The reference, no doubt, is to the confederacy of the other kings. The Gibeonites also acted upon what they had heard, but they preferred an accommodation to war. So Calvin and Rosenmuller; also Drusius. And they felt that they could only effect their purpose by craft. Other explanations are given, such as that a reference is made to Joshua's stratagem at Ai. Keil rejects both, and proposes an explanation of his own, which is unintelligible. Origen's interpretation here is interesting as a specimen of the theology of the third century. He regards the Gibeonites as the type of men who, though they are enrolled in the Church as believers and have faith in God, and acquiesce in all the Divine precepts, and are ready enough to take part in all the external duties of religion, are yet involved in vices and foulnesses, like the Gibeonites in their old garments and clouted shoes. They display no signs of improvement or alteration, yet Jesus our Lord concedes to them salvation, even though that salvation does not escape a certain stigma of disgrace. That there may be some persons in a condition somewhat resembling this described by Origen may be admitted, but it is difficult to see how any one in a state of salvation can display no signs of improvement whatever. There are many who do not improve as they might, whom we should yet hesitate to pronounce altogether reprobate from God. But surely the entire absence of all improvement is a manifest sign of reprobation. This passage is one of many among the voluminous works of Origen in which that holy and learned man has not sufficiently weighed what he was saying (see below, ver. 23). <span class="cmt_word">Made as if they had been ambassadors.</span> "Sent an embassy" (Luther). If we take this reading, we must suppose, with Grotius and others, the word to be the Hithpahel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> to go, to revolve. But the form is rare, and the word is elsewhere unknown, at least in Hebrew, though an Arabic form of it is found. It is therefore better to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> "they prepared themselves provisions." This is the reading of the LXX., the Vulgate, the Chaldee, the Syriac, and of most modern editors. It is rendered still more probable by the occurrence of the same word in ver. 12. <span class="cmt_word">Old sacks</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">worn out</span>, and so throughout the passage. The usual mode of conveyance still in the East is in sackcloth bags on the backs of horses, mules, camels, and asses. Such bags are apt to meet with rough usage in a long journey. <span class="cmt_word">Wine bottles.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">wine skins</span>, the wine then being kept in skins, not in vessels of glass. This explains how they could be burst open (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) and tied up. These skins were hung up frequently in the smoke (<a href="/psalms/119-83.htm">Psalm 119:83</a>), which gave them a shrivelled appearance. The first bottles were made of such skins, as Herodotus tells us. The Egyptian monuments confirm his statements, displaying as they do skins of animals so used, with the legs or the neck forming what we still term the "neck" of the bottle (cf.
