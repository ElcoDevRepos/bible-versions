It underscores God's faithfulness and sovereignty in delivering on His covenant promises. The land was a tangible sign of God's blessing and a central element of the Abrahamic Covenant. This fulfillment also serves as a type of the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<p><b>He had sworn to give their fathers</b><br>The reference to "their fathers" connects the current generation of Israelites to the patriarchs, emphasizing continuity in God's plan. This promise was reiterated multiple times throughout Genesis (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3, 28</a>:13). It also reflects the importance of oaths and covenants in the ancient Near Eastern context, where divine promises were considered unbreakable. The fulfillment of this oath is a testament to God's unchanging nature and reliability (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><b>and they took possession of it</b><br>Taking possession involved both divine intervention and human responsibility. The Israelites had to engage in battles and follow God's commands to claim the land (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3, 11</a>:23). This duality of divine provision and human action is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the partnership between God and His people. It also prefigures the Christian life, where believers are called to actively pursue their spiritual inheritance (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<p><b>and settled in it</b><br>Settling in the land signifies a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a more stable, agrarian society. This shift had significant cultural and religious implications, as it allowed the Israelites to establish a centralized place of worship and governance. Theologically, it represents entering into God's rest, a theme later expanded in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>). The settlement also foreshadows the eternal rest and home believers will have in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who fulfills His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are the recipients of God's promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to Canaan, the Promised Land that God swore to give to the patriarchs and their descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom God originally made the promise of the land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/possession_and_settlement.htm">Possession and Settlement</a></b><br>The act of Israel taking control of the land and establishing their homes there, signifying the fulfillment of God's promise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to fulfill His promises, as seen in His giving of the land to Israel.

Our task is to trust Him fully and walk in the blessings He has already secured.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave.</span> The LXX. adds before this passage: "And Joshua completed the division of the land in its boundaries, and the children gave a portion to Joshua, by the commandment of the Lord. They gave to him the city for which he asked, Thamnath Sarach gave they him in Mount Ephraim, and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it. And Joshua took the stone knives, with which he had circumcised the children of Israel, which were in the way in the wilderness, and he placed them in Tamnath Sarach." The repetition is very much in the manner of the sacred historian, and it is possible that we have here an authentic passage, which some copyist has omitted in the Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">All the land.</span> As has been before remarked, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> must not be pressed to mean literally "all." Yet, in a sense, the word is true here. The land had been put in their power. They had only to exert themselves to complete its conquest. This they failed to do, and not only so, but violated the conditions under which the land was granted them. Thus they soon fell under the dominion of those who had been their own vassals. Ritter thinks (vol. 3. 187-189) that the Asherites and Danites submitted to the inhabitants of the land in consequence of being allowed equal citizen rights with them. He draws this inference from <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>, supposing that these tribes addicted themselves to the commercial and maritime life for which the Phoenicians were so famous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
