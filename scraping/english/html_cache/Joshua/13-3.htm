This boundary signifies the extent of the land that God intended for the Israelites to possess, highlighting the vastness of the Promised Land. The mention of Egypt recalls the Israelites' deliverance from slavery, emphasizing God's faithfulness in bringing them to a land of their own.<p><b>to the territory of Ekron on the north</b><br>Ekron was one of the five major cities of the Philistines, located in the northern part of Philistine territory. This city was significant in the biblical narrative as a center of Philistine power and opposition to Israel. The mention of Ekron underscores the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Philistines, a theme prevalent throughout the historical books of the Old Testament.<p><b>(considered to be Canaanite territory)</b><br>This parenthetical note indicates that the land described was traditionally inhabited by the Canaanites, the original inhabitants of the Promised Land. The Canaanites were known for their idolatrous practices, which were in direct opposition to the worship of Yahweh. The Israelites were commanded to drive out the Canaanites to avoid being led astray by their practices, reflecting the theme of holiness and separation found throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>that of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron</b><br>The five Philistine cities were known as the Pentapolis, each ruled by its own leader. These cities were centers of Philistine culture and military strength. The Philistines were a significant adversary to Israel, and their presence in the land represented a continual threat to the Israelites' security and faithfulness to God. The Philistines' advanced military technology, including their use of iron, made them formidable opponents.<p><b>as well as that of the Avvites</b><br>The Avvites were another group of people living in the region, possibly a subset of the Canaanites or a distinct ethnic group. Their mention alongside the Philistines highlights the diverse and complex nature of the inhabitants of the land. The presence of multiple groups in the territory underscores the challenge Israel faced in fully possessing the land and the need for reliance on God's guidance and strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shihor.htm">Shihor</a></b><br>Often identified with the eastern branch of the Nile or a river in Egypt, marking the southern boundary of the land yet to be conquered.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron.htm">Ekron</a></b><br>A Philistine city located in the northern part of the territory described, representing the northern boundary of the unconquered land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the land, representing the peoples and cultures that Israel was to displace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant group of people in the region, known for their conflicts with Israel.

Naming each Philistine city and the Avvites shows God&#8217;s comprehensive concern for purity and obedience: partial victories are not enough. The verse calls God&#8217;s people to trust His faithfulness, confront every stronghold, and press on until the whole inheritance is theirs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Sihor.</span> This word, which has the article in Hebrew, is literally <span class="accented">the black river.</span> This has been thought to be the Nile, known to both Greeks and Latins by that title. The Greeks called it <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. So Virgil says of it, "AEgyptum nigra foecundat arena." The Vulgate has "a fluvio turbido qui irrigat AEgyptum." The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The phrase which is "before" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Egypt seems to exclude the idea of the Nile, since the Nile flowed through the centre of Egypt, and it is impossible to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. As Drusins remarks, moreover, the Nile is always called either <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> or "the river of Egypt." The interpreation which has found most favour of late, therefore, refers this expression to a small river that flows into the sea at the extreme southern border of Palestine. This river was known as the "river of Egypt" (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and is now called the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arisch</span> (cf. also <a href="/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4, 47</a>, as well as <a href="/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">nahal</span>, or <span class="accented">winter torrent</span>, a word inapplicable to the Nile). For Sihor, or Shichor, see <a href="/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and especially <a href="/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>, which seems decisive against the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">Which is counted to the Canaanite.</span> These words are connected by the Masorites with what follows: <span class="accented">The five lords of the Philistines are reckoned to the Canaanite.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The five lords of the Philistines.</span> The Philistines (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Cf. <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>, and <a href="/1_chronicles/1-12.htm">1 Chronicles 1:12</a>) are supposed to be of Egyptian origin. Ewald (also Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) believes Caphtor to be Crete, and supposes the Cherethites and Pelethites who formed David's body-guard (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) to be Cretans and Philistines (see <a href="/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). But this opinion is disputed by many commentators of note, and is far from probable in itself. They were David's most trusted and faithful troops, and it seems hardly probable that so truly national a monarch would have assigned the post of honour around his person to the hereditary enemies of his race. Ritter, however, believes the Cherethites and Pelethites to be Philistines, and appeals to <a href="/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, and still more forcibly to <a href="/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4, 5</a>. It should be remembered, too, that Ittai was a Gittite, or native of Gath (see <a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>). The term here used, translated <span class="accented">lords</span> (<span class="accented">satraps</span>, LXX.), is peculiar to the Philistines. It is to be found also in <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. In <a href="/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> the word means an <span class="accented">axle</span>, or perhaps the outside plating of the wheel, and in the kindred languages it signifies a wheel. The expression is remarkable in connection with the phrase "circles of the Philistines." <span class="cmt_word">The Eshkalalonites.</span> The inhabitants of Ashkelon, as the Gittites are of Gath. <span class="cmt_word">Also the Avites.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">the Avites."</span> There is no "also" in the original, though the Avites or Avim are supposed (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and note on Geshuri in the last verse)to have been aborigines preceding the Canaanites, and dispossessed by the Philistines. Keil, however, disputes this view, and holds that we have no evidence that any but a Canaanitish people dwelt in southwestern Palestine. This Canaanitish tribe, he thinks, was driven out by the Philistines. Some few of the Avites, or rather Avvites, continued to dwell among their conquerors. But the coincidence between <a href="/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22, 23</a>, and <a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, makes strongly for Ewald's view above. And Keil and Delitzsch, in their later joint work, incline to it. See Introduction III. The word Avvim, like Havoth, or Havvoth (see ver. 30), is supposed to mean villages, or inhabited enclosures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Shihor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
