The worn and patched sandals suggest a long journey, implying they came from a distant land, which was part of their ruse. In the ancient Near East, footwear was a significant indicator of one's status and journey. The Israelites, having recently crossed the Jordan and conquered Jericho and Ai, were wary of local inhabitants but might have been more trusting of distant travelers. This deception reflects the broader biblical theme of appearances versus reality, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God reminds Samuel that He looks at the heart, not outward appearances.<p><b>and threadbare clothing on their bodies</b><br>The threadbare clothing further supports the Gibeonites' claim of having traveled from afar. In the cultural context of the time, clothing was a valuable commodity, often repaired and reused until it was no longer serviceable. The Gibeonites' choice to wear such clothing was a calculated move to reinforce their story. This act of deception can be compared to Jacob's deception of Isaac in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>, where outward appearances were manipulated to achieve a desired outcome. The Israelites' failure to discern the truth here serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of seeking divine guidance in decision-making.<p><b>and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy</b><br>The dry and moldy bread was another element of the Gibeonites' deception, intended to convince the Israelites of their long journey. In the ancient world, bread was a staple food, and its condition would have been a clear indicator of the time elapsed since it was baked. This detail underscores the lengths to which the Gibeonites went to ensure their survival, as they feared the fate of other Canaanite cities. The Israelites' acceptance of this evidence without seeking God's counsel parallels other biblical instances where reliance on human wisdom leads to error, such as in the case of the Israelites' initial defeat at Ai (Joshua 7). This narrative also foreshadows the necessity of spiritual discernment, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to test everything and hold onto what is good (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the city of Gibeon who, fearing the Israelites, resorted to deception to secure a peace treaty with them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who was responsible for leading the people into the Promised Land and making decisions regarding treaties and warfare.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were commanded to conquer the land of Canaan and were warned against making covenants with the inhabitants of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land promised to the Israelites by God, which they were in the process of conquering under Joshua's leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deception_event.htm">Deception Event</a></b><br>The Gibeonites' act of deception, where they disguised themselves as travelers from a distant land to make a treaty with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_decision-making.htm">Discernment in Decision-Making</a></b><br>The Israelites failed to seek God's guidance before making a treaty with the Gibeonites.

Every rip shouted, &#8220;We are no threat; we only seek peace.&#8221;<p>- The irony is striking: forty years earlier God kept Israel&#8217;s clothes from wearing out in the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>), yet here pagans voluntarily put on rags to gain favor with Israel.<p>- Jesus points to similar surface-level religiosity when He calls out hypocritical Pharisees who &#8220;clean the outside of the cup&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>). Both examples show that shabby or polished exteriors can mask a heart agenda.<p>- Israel, freshly victorious over Ai, was vulnerable to flattery and pity; threadbare robes played on both emotions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy</b><p>- The bread sealed the illusion. They claimed, &#8220;When we left home, this bread was warm&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-12.htm">Joshua 9:12</a>), so its decay &#8220;proved&#8221; the length of their trip.<p>- Biblically, bread pictures sustenance (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>; <a href="/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-35</a>). The Gibeonites used even this everyday necessity as a tool of deception, twisting something good to achieve a fraudulent covenant.<p>- Their moldy loaves echo Esau selling his birthright for a meal (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>) and the crowd following Jesus mainly for physical bread (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26-27</a>). Both stories warn that focusing on immediate, visible needs can blind people to deeper spiritual realities.<p>- Joshua and the leaders, moved by the props, swore an oath without first asking God&#8212;an omission that had long-term consequences (<a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-5.htm">Joshua 9:5</a> records three deliberate props&#8212;tattered sandals, worn-out clothes, and moldy bread&#8212;crafted to fool Israel into thinking the Gibeonites were distant travelers rather than nearby inhabitants marked for judgment. The verse highlights how easily godly people can be misdirected when they rely on sight instead of seeking the Lord. It challenges believers today to look beyond appearances, test every claim against Scripture, and consult God before entering into binding agreements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Clouted</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> patched.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shoes</span>.
