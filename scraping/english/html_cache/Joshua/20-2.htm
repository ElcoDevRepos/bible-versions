It reflects the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua and the responsibility of Joshua to guide the people according to God's instructions. The Israelites, as God's covenant people, are reminded of their unique relationship with Him and their obligation to follow His commands.<p><b>to designate the cities of refuge</b><br>The cities of refuge were a provision for justice and mercy within the Israelite legal system. These cities were strategically located throughout the land to be accessible to anyone in need. They served as a place where individuals who had accidentally committed manslaughter could seek asylum from the avenger of blood until a fair trial could be conducted. This system highlights God's concern for justice and the protection of human life. It also foreshadows the concept of sanctuary and refuge found in Christ, who offers spiritual refuge and salvation.<p><b>as I instructed you through Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the continuity and consistency of God's law and instructions. The establishment of cities of refuge was initially commanded in the Mosaic Law, specifically in <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-34</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. It demonstrates the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises and the importance of adhering to His commands. The reference to Moses also serves to legitimize Joshua's leadership, as he is seen as the successor carrying out the divine instructions given to Moses.
