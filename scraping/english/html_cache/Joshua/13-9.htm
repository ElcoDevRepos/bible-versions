This location is significant in biblical history as it marks the southern border of the land allocated to the tribe of Reuben. The Arnon Valley itself is a deep gorge that provided a formidable natural defense. In the context of Israel's conquest, this area represents the beginning of the land east of the Jordan River that was taken from Sihon, king of the Amorites, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24-26</a>.<p><b>along with the city in the middle of the valley</b><br>The city in the middle of the valley likely refers to a settlement that was strategically located for trade and defense. This city would have been important for controlling the passage through the valley, which was a key route for travelers and merchants. The mention of a city here underscores the completeness of the conquest and the thoroughness with which the Israelites took possession of the land.<p><b>the whole plateau of Medeba</b><br>The plateau of Medeba is a highland region known for its fertile land, making it valuable for agriculture. Medeba itself is an ancient city that later became part of the territory of the tribe of Reuben. This area is mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, which highlights its significance in the region. The plateau's elevation provided a strategic advantage for military and communication purposes.<p><b>as far as Dibon</b><br>Dibon was an important city in the region, later becoming a Moabite stronghold. It is mentioned in the Mesha Stele, an ancient Moabite stone inscription, which provides archaeological evidence of its historical significance. In the biblical narrative, Dibon is part of the land given to the tribe of Gad, as noted in <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>.

Three, or even four, cities of this name were known, and have been identified by modern travellers under names somewhat similar. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Aroer upon Aruon, on the north bank of that river, at the extreme south of the territory of Reuben (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; and probably <a href="/jeremiah/48-19.htm">Jeremiah 48:19</a>). <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Aroer in Gad (<a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), described there as "before," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the way to "Rabbah." It was no doubt some short distance to the westward of this chief city of the Ammonites (see also <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>, where the Gadites are said to have built it). These two are probably the "cities of Aroer" referred to in <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a> (but see next note but one, where also <a href="/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> will be discussed). <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A city in Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>). To one of these cities probably belonged Shammah or Shammoth, the Hararite or Harorite (<a href="/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a>; he is called Harodite in ver. 25, and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-27.htm">1 Chronicles 11:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river Arnon</span> (see note on Joshua 12:2). <span class="cmt_word">The city that is in the midst of the river.</span> This city (or perhaps cities) has received but little attention from commentators, probably by reason of its bearing no name. Those who have tried to identify it have failed In <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>, in this passage, and in <a href="/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a>, it is mentioned in connection with Aroer. In <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, instead of "the city that is in the midst of the river," we find simply "the middle (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5da;</span>) of the river." But as <a href="/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> stands in our version, the city referred to stood in the middle of the <span class="accented">river of Gad.</span> This would suggest the idea that the old derivation of Aroer by Wells and others from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (city) doubled, with the signification of the <span class="accented">double city</span>, is nearer the mark than that of <span class="accented">wasteness</span>, or <span class="accented">desolateness</span>, or nakedness, as of a region bare of trees, which has found favour of late, and it is not without support in Hebrew forms. A city, moreover, in the midst of or "on the brink of" a winter torrent would be less likely to be waste or desolate than in other situations. But we are not yet at the end of our difficulties. The word Nahal, which comes before Gad in the passage of which we are now speaking, has the article. Thus the translation, "river of Gad" cannot be maintained. And besides, the enumeration of the people must have begun at the Arnon, or southern border of Israel beyond Jordan. It is possible that the text may be corrupt here, as it is in other parts of 2 Samuel, and possibly the meaning may be that the officers pitched in Aroer, passed through Reuben, and having come within the confines of Gad arrived at Jazer. This again is rendered doubtful by the close connection of Aroer and Jazer in <a href="/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. It is of course, therefore, possible that the reference in <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>. is to the Jabbok, not the Arnon ravine. A question, of such intricacy can only be Settled, if settled at all, by an investigation on. the spot. <span class="cmt_word">The plain.</span> The word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>.

This is mentioned in Scripture, together with Dibon, as here in <a href="/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. It was on the level ground before mentioned (see Gesenius, s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). Dibon (see <a href="/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>, called Dimon in <a href="/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>; but Dibon in <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; see also <a href="/numbers/33-45.htm">Numbers 33:45, 46</a>). It was one of the cities built by the children of Gad (<a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>). It is now called Dhiban, and is a short distance north of the Arnon. The Moabite stone, found at Dibon in 1868, mentions the occupation of Medeba by Omri, and implies that Dibon, the principal city in those parts, was also subject to him, but recovered finally by Mesha. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[The area] from Aroer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1441;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
