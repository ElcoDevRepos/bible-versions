This area provided natural cover and was less accessible to chariots and large groups, making it an ideal hiding place. The geographical context highlights the strategic wisdom in Rahab's advice, as the terrain would have been familiar to the Israelites, who had been wandering in similar landscapes.<p><b>she said,</b><br>Rahab's role is significant as she is a Canaanite woman aiding Israelite spies. Her actions demonstrate a pivotal moment of faith and alliance with God's people, which is later acknowledged in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) and in the "Hall of Faith" (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>). Her words carry weight as they reflect her understanding of the situation and her commitment to the spies' safety.<p><b>so that your pursuers will not find you.</b><br>The pursuers were likely soldiers or guards sent by the king of Jericho to capture the spies. Rahab's knowledge of their movements and her strategic advice underscore her intelligence and resourcefulness. This phrase also reflects the theme of divine protection and guidance, as God uses Rahab to ensure the spies' safety.<p><b>Hide yourselves there for three days</b><br>The instruction to hide for three days is significant, as the number three often symbolizes completeness or divine intervention in the Bible. This period would allow the pursuers to search and return without finding the spies, ensuring their safety. The three-day motif is seen in other biblical narratives, such as Jonah in the belly of the fish and Jesus in the tomb, symbolizing a period of waiting followed by deliverance.<p><b>until they have returned;</b><br>This indicates Rahab's awareness of the pursuers' plans and her strategic thinking. The return of the pursuers would signal the end of immediate danger, allowing the spies to continue their mission. This phrase highlights the importance of timing and patience in God's plan, as seen in other biblical stories where waiting leads to fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>then go on your way.</b><br>Rahab's final instruction is a release to continue their mission, emphasizing her role in God's plan for Israel's conquest of Canaan. This phrase signifies a transition from hiding to action, reflecting the broader theme of faith leading to obedience and fulfillment of God's promises. The spies' journey is part of the larger narrative of Israel's entry into the Promised Land, foreshadowing the ultimate victory and settlement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho who is known for her faith and courage.

But a reference to the geography of the district will supply the reason. Any mountain district is usually less accessible and less thickly inhabited than the plains. But within five miles of Jericho lay the remarkable range called Quarantania, or Kuruntul, which is literally honeycombed with caves, so that a man might be concealed for months in the immediate neighbourhood of Jericho with a very slight risk of discovery. It is obvious how strongly this fact confirms the accuracy of the narrative. An inventor would have been certain in some way or other to draw attention to a statement intended to give an air of probability to his narrative. But there is nothing of the kind here, and yet the narrative displays a thorough acquaintance with the geographical features of the neighbourhood. Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 207, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.) carefully explored the caverns. On one face of the rock, which is perpendicular, he found "some thirty or forty habitable caves," and on the southern face, towards Jericho, he supposed there were a good many more than this. The scouts of the king of Jericho might be excused a very diligent search, for we are told that the "foot hold was hazardous and the height dizzy." From the days of the spies till long after the Christian era, these caves have been in existence. They have been tenanted by Greek, Syrian, and even Abyssinian monks, and Canon Tristram found many Greek and Ethiopic inscriptions, as well as figures of our Lord and the saints. The Abyssinian Christians make a yearly pilgrimage there even now. The reason of the reverence in which the place is held, is the tradition (not, however, eight hundred years old, see Bitter, 3:37) that, as the name Quarantania implies, the forty days' fast of our Lord took place there. As a specimen of the mystical interpretations in which the Fathers indulged, we find Origen expounding the advice, "Get you to the mountains," as follows: "Humilia et dejecta refugite, quae excelsa sunt et sublimia, praedicate." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the hill country,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
