Zebulun, the sixth son of Jacob and Leah, was one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The tribe's inheritance was determined by casting lots, a practice that emphasized God's sovereignty in the distribution of the land. Zebulun's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, which would later play a significant role in Israel's history, particularly during the time of Jesus, as it included areas like Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee.<p><b>The border of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid:</b><br>Sarid is believed to be a location on the southern boundary of Zebulun's territory. While its exact location is uncertain today, it is thought to be near modern-day Tell Shadud. The delineation of borders was crucial for maintaining tribal identities and responsibilities. Zebulun's land was strategically positioned, providing access to trade routes and fertile land, fulfilling Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a>, which prophesied Zebulun's proximity to the sea and involvement in commerce. This positioning also foreshadows the New Testament, where the region of Galilee, part of Zebulun's inheritance, becomes central to Jesus' ministry, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about a great light shining in Galilee (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebulun.htm">Zebulun</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Zebulun, the sixth son of Jacob and Leah.
