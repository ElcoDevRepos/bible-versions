Forsaking the LORD implies a deliberate turning away from the covenant obligations. Historically, Israel's relationship with God was based on the covenant made at Sinai, where they pledged exclusive worship to Yahweh. This warning reflects the conditional nature of the covenant, where blessings are contingent upon obedience.<p><b>and serve foreign gods,</b><br>The mention of "foreign gods" highlights the prevalent temptation for Israel to adopt the deities of surrounding nations, such as Baal and Asherah. This was a recurring issue throughout Israel's history, as seen in the Book of Judges and the accounts of the kings. Serving foreign gods was not just a religious act but also a cultural assimilation that threatened Israel's distinct identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>He will turn and bring disaster on you</b><br>This phrase underscores the consequences of breaking the covenant. The idea of God "turning" suggests a change in His dealings with Israel, from protection and blessing to judgment and punishment. This is consistent with the Deuteronomic theology, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28). Historical examples include the Babylonian exile, which was seen as a direct result of Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and consume you,</b><br>The term "consume" indicates total destruction or severe judgment. This can be seen in the context of the conquest narratives, where God commanded the Israelites to completely destroy the Canaanite nations. The warning here is that the same fate could befall Israel if they turn away from God. This reflects the seriousness of idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>even after He has been good to you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and blessings to Israel, such as the deliverance from Egypt and the provision in the wilderness. It highlights the ingratitude and betrayal involved in forsaking God after experiencing His goodness. This echoes the prophetic messages found in books like Hosea, where God's past kindness is contrasted with Israel's unfaithfulness. The goodness of God is a recurring theme that points to His character and the expectation of a reciprocal relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who has delivered them from Egypt and given them the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>The deities worshiped by the surrounding nations, which the Israelites are warned against serving.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are being reminded of their covenant obligations and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The place where Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to renew the covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but can include anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

He has no more altered His position than the sun, which, as we say, rises in the east and sets in the west.
