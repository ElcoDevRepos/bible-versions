Gezer was a significant city located in the Shephelah region, strategically positioned on the route between Jerusalem and the coastal plain. Archaeological evidence confirms its importance, with findings of fortifications and inscriptions. The Canaanites' continued presence indicates a compromise that would later lead to spiritual and cultural challenges for Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/2.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>.<p><b>So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day,</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the text was written at a time when the Canaanites were still present, highlighting the long-term consequences of incomplete obedience. The tribe of Ephraim, one of the leading tribes of Israel, was unable to fully claim their inheritance due to this failure. This coexistence often led to the Israelites adopting Canaanite practices, which were contrary to the covenantal laws given to them (<a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-6</a>). The presence of the Canaanites among the Ephraimites serves as a warning about the dangers of assimilation and the loss of distinctiveness as God's people.<p><b>but they are forced laborers.</b><br>The Canaanites being reduced to forced laborers reflects a partial fulfillment of God's command, as they were subdued but not expelled. This arrangement might have seemed beneficial economically, providing labor for the Israelites, but it was a deviation from God's directive to completely remove the influence of the Canaanites. This compromise foreshadows future issues, as seen in Solomon's reign, where forced labor became a significant part of Israel's economy (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-21</a>). Theologically, this situation illustrates the tension between God's ideal and human pragmatism, and it serves as a type pointing to the ultimate rest and victory found in Jesus Christ, who fully conquers sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the land of Canaan, known for their idolatrous practices and opposition to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gezer.htm">Gezer</a></b><br>A significant Canaanite city located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Ephraim.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraimites.htm">Ephraimites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Ephraim, one of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, responsible for leading the Israelites into the Promised Land and overseeing its division among the tribes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forced_labor.htm">Forced Labor</a></b><br>The Canaanites in Gezer were subjected to servitude, indicating a failure to fully obey God's command to drive out the inhabitants.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/incomplete_obedience_leads_to_compromise.htm">Incomplete Obedience Leads to Compromise</a></b><br>The failure to drive out the Canaanites resulted in a compromise that affected Israel's spiritual purity and obedience to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_coexistence_with_sin.htm">The Danger of Coexistence with Sin</a></b><br>Allowing the Canaanites to remain in the land symbolizes the danger of allowing sin to coexist in our lives, leading to spiritual decline.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' disobedience had long-term consequences, as seen in their ongoing struggles with idolatry and foreign influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_commands_require_full_commitment.htm">God's Commands Require Full Commitment</a></b><br>God's instructions are meant to be followed completely, not partially, to ensure His blessings and protection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_vigilance.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Believers must remain vigilant in their spiritual walk, continually rooting out sin and influences that can lead them away from God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_16_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 16:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_couldn_t_Israelites_expel_Canaanites.htm">Why did the Israelites fail to drive out the Canaanites in Joshua 16:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_16_10_Incomplete_obedience_effects.htm">How does Joshua 16:10 illustrate consequences of incomplete obedience to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Joshua_16_10_on_resisting_sin.htm">What lessons from Joshua 16:10 apply to resisting sin in our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_16_10_to_Deut_s_expulsion_orders.htm">How does Joshua 16:10 connect with God's commands in Deuteronomy about driving out nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Modern_Canaanites_in_Christian_life.htm">What modern "Canaanites" might Christians need to address in their spiritual lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_couldn_t_Israelites_expel_Canaanites_3.htm">Why did the Israelites fail to drive out the Canaanites in Joshua 16:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Joshua_16_10_about_Israelite_disobedience.htm">Does Joshua 16:10 suggest a lack of faith or obedience among the Israelites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_16_10_and_God_s_conquest_command.htm">How does Joshua 16:10 align with God's command to conquer the Promised Land?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_do_joshua_16_10_and_1_kings_9_15-16_differ.htm">Why does Joshua 16:10 say the Canaanites in Gezer became forced labor, yet 1 Kings 9:15&#8211;16 seems to contradict who controlled Gezer&#8217;s fate?

Whether from fear (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>), fatigue, or misplaced mercy, they chose military convenience over full obedience.<p>&#8226; Partial obedience is still disobedience. Later generations felt the weight of this compromise (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;to this day&#8221; (also used in <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>; 7:26) signals the ongoing reality when the book was written: the Canaanites were still embedded in Ephraim&#8217;s territory.<p>&#8226; Living side-by-side produced constant temptation toward idolatry, exactly what God had warned about (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>; <a href="/judges/3-5.htm">Judges 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; This co-existence foreshadows Israel&#8217;s later spiritual decline recorded in Judges and 1 Kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they are forced laborers</b><p>&#8226; Instead of driving them out, Ephraim enslaved them, mirroring what other tribes did when they &#8220;put the Canaanites to forced labor&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="/judges/1-28.htm">Judges 1:28, 30</a>).<p>&#8226; Economic gain replaced covenant loyalty.

There is a distinction, apparently, between this passage and ch. 15:63. There the tribe of Judah was unable to drive out the Jebusites from their stronghold, and no mention is made of tribute. Here the Ephraimites seem deliberately to have preferred the easier task of reducing the Canaanites to tribute to the sterner and more difficult task of destroying them utterly. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/16-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But they did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
