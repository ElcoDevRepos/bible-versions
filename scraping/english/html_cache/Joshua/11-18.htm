The wars were not merely political but were seen as acts of divine judgment against the Canaanite nations for their idolatry and immorality (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>).<p><b>against all these kings</b><br>The "kings" refer to the various rulers of the Canaanite city-states. Each city-state was often ruled by its own king, and these kings formed coalitions to resist the Israelite invasion. This reflects the fragmented political landscape of Canaan during this period, as confirmed by archaeological findings of city-state structures and records of local rulers.<p><b>for a long period of time</b><br>The conquest of Canaan was not a swift campaign but took several years, possibly around seven years, as inferred from the broader biblical narrative (<a href="/joshua/14-7.htm">Joshua 14:7, 10</a>). This extended period allowed for the systematic defeat of the Canaanite coalitions and the gradual settlement of the Israelites. The prolonged warfare also served to test the faith and perseverance of the Israelites, as they relied on God's promises for victory (<a href="/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites, succeeding Moses.
