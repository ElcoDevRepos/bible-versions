Its conquest is significant as it was the first city taken by the Israelites in their campaign to possess the Promised Land. The fall of Jericho, as described in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>, involved a miraculous intervention by God, where the walls of the city collapsed after the Israelites marched around them for seven days. This event underscores the theme of divine assistance in Israel's military victories. Jericho's king represents the first of many Canaanite rulers defeated by Joshua, symbolizing the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The destruction of Jericho also serves as a type of final judgment, with Rahab's salvation prefiguring the redemption available through faith in Christ.<p><b>the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;</b><br>Ai was a smaller city compared to Jericho, located east of Bethel. The initial defeat of the Israelites at Ai, as recorded in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, was due to Achan's sin, highlighting the importance of obedience and holiness among God's people. After dealing with the sin, Joshua led a successful ambush against Ai, as described in <a href="/joshua/8.htm">Joshua 8</a>. The strategic location of Ai near Bethel is significant, as Bethel was a major religious site in Israel's history, associated with the patriarch Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). The victory over Ai, following repentance and renewed obedience, illustrates the principle that success in God's mission requires faithfulness to His commands. The conquest of Ai also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who leads His people to spiritual triumph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_jericho.htm">King of Jericho</a></b><br>The ruler of Jericho, a significant city in the conquest of Canaan.
