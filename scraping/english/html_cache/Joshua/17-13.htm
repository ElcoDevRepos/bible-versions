Historically, this strength could be attributed to their growing population, military successes, and consolidation of the land they had already conquered. Theologically, it reflects God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan. This period of strength is a fulfillment of earlier promises made to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>, where God promises the land to Abraham's descendants.<p><b>they put the Canaanites to forced labor</b><br>The Israelites' decision to subject the Canaanites to forced labor rather than driving them out entirely reflects a compromise with God's command. In <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>, God instructed the Israelites to completely destroy the inhabitants of the land to avoid being led astray by their practices. The use of forced labor was a common practice in the ancient Near East, often used to subjugate conquered peoples. This decision may have been motivated by economic benefits, as the Canaanites could contribute labor to agricultural and construction projects.<p><b>but they failed to drive them out completely</b><br>This failure to fully obey God's command had significant spiritual and practical consequences for the Israelites. The presence of the Canaanites among them led to future idolatry and moral compromise, as seen in the Book of Judges. This incomplete obedience is a recurring theme in Israel's history, highlighting the tension between God's commands and human actions. It serves as a warning about the dangers of partial obedience and the long-term consequences of failing to fully follow God's instructions. This situation foreshadows the struggles Israel would face with idolatry and assimilation into pagan cultures, which are addressed by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were led by Joshua into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The original inhabitants of the land of Canaan, which God promised to the Israelites.
