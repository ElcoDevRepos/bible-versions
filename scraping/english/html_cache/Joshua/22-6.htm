This blessing signifies approval and a prayer for prosperity and success. In the context of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, it acknowledges their faithful service in helping conquer the Promised Land. The act of blessing is reminiscent of patriarchal blessings seen in Genesis, such as those given by Jacob to his sons, and it underscores the continuity of God's covenantal promises.<p><b>and sent them on their way</b><br>This phrase indicates a formal dismissal, marking the completion of a mission. The tribes had fulfilled their commitment to assist their fellow Israelites in securing the land west of the Jordan River. This sending off is not just a physical departure but also a release from their military obligations, allowing them to return to their own inheritance east of the Jordan. It reflects the importance of keeping vows and the integrity of communal responsibility within the Israelite confederation.<p><b>and they went to their homes</b><br>The return to their homes signifies a restoration to normalcy and peace after a period of warfare. The "homes" refer to the lands allotted to them by Moses on the east side of the Jordan, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. This return is a fulfillment of God's promise to give rest to His people in the land He has provided. It also highlights the theme of rest and inheritance, which is a precursor to the ultimate rest found in Christ, as discussed in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>. The journey back to their homes is both a physical and spiritual return to the place of God's provision and promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, who led the people into the Promised Land.
