The use of "Lord GOD" indicates a recognition of God's sovereignty and authority. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to denote a personal and covenantal relationship with God, highlighting Joshua's role as a leader who seeks divine guidance. It echoes the language of Moses, showing continuity in leadership and faith.<p><b>"why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan"</b><br>This question reflects a moment of crisis and doubt. The crossing of the Jordan was a miraculous event, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the beginning of the conquest of Canaan. Joshua's question reveals his struggle to understand God's plan in the face of unexpected defeat. It parallels the Israelites' earlier complaints in the wilderness, showing a recurring theme of doubt and testing in the journey to the Promised Land.<p><b>"to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed?"</b><br>The Amorites were one of the prominent Canaanite tribes, often representing the collective opposition to Israel's settlement in the land. Joshua's fear of destruction at their hands underscores the gravity of Israel's defeat at Ai. This phrase highlights the tension between God's promises and the present reality, a common theme in the narrative of Israel's conquest. It also foreshadows the need for Israel to remain faithful to God's covenant to ensure victory.<p><b>"If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!"</b><br>This expression of regret mirrors the Israelites' earlier complaints in the wilderness, where they longed to return to Egypt. It reflects a human tendency to doubt and desire the familiar in times of trial. The "other side of the Jordan" represents safety and the known past, contrasting with the challenges of faith and obedience required in the Promised Land. This phrase serves as a reminder of the cost of unbelief and the importance of trusting in God's promises despite difficulties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The question reveals:<p>&#8226; A collision between recent victory at Jericho and sudden defeat at Ai.<p>&#8226; How quickly human perspective shifts when circumstances change (<a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>).<p>&#8226; A reminder that God&#8217;s promises remain unchanged, though His people&#8217;s obedience matters (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed?</b><p>Joshua&#8217;s words expose the fear that God might reverse His purpose, but Scripture consistently shows that judgment follows sin, not arbitrary cruelty (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5-6</a>). Key truths surface:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s character is just; Israel&#8217;s secret sin (Achan&#8217;s theft, <a href="/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11</a>) invited discipline.<p>&#8226; The Amorites symbolize entrenched opposition to God&#8217;s rule (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even perceived setbacks fit within God&#8217;s larger plan to purify His people (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!</b><p>This longing for the &#8220;easier&#8221; past mirrors the earlier desire to return to Egypt (<a href="/numbers/14-3.htm">Numbers 14:3-4</a>).

But their rendering is a clear grammatical blunder, for the Masorites remark that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> is to be preserved. <span class="cmt_word">Would to God we had been content.</span> Calvin makes some severe remarks on Joshua's folly and want of faith under this reverse. But it may be paralleled by the conduct of most Christians in adversity. How few are there who can bear even temporal calamity calmly and patiently, even though they have abundant reason to know that temporal affliction is not only no sign of the displeasure of God, but the reverse! And when, through allowing secret sin to lurk within the soul, the Christian is overcome and brought to shame by his spiritual enemies, how much more seldom it is that he has the courage to gird up the loins of his soul and renew the conflict, in full confidence that victory will be his in the end! How much more frequently does he despair of victory, wish he had never undertaken the Christian profession, give up his belief in the protecting care and guidance of God, and desist, at least for a time, from the good fight of faith, to his own serious injury and to the detriment of God's Church! "It is not," adds Calvin, "a new thing for pious minds, when they aspire to seek God with holy zeal, to obscure the light of faith by the vehemence and impetuosity of their affections. And in this way all prayers would be rendered valueless, did not the Lord in His boundless indulgence pardon them, and, wiping away all their stains, receive them as if they were pure. And yet while in thus freely expostulating they cast all their care upon God, this blunt simplicity, though it needs pardon, is yet far more acceptable than the feigned modesty and self restraint of the hypocrites." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/7-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;O,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1468;
