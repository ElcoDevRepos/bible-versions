It is often identified with modern-day Tell Qades. Kedesh was designated as a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), which provided asylum for those who accidentally committed manslaughter. This highlights the city's importance in the judicial and religious life of Israel. The mention of the "king of Kedesh" signifies the conquest of this area by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan. The singular "one" indicates the specific defeat of this king, emphasizing the thoroughness of Israel's conquest. Kedesh's role as a city of refuge can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides refuge and salvation for sinners.<p><b>the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;</b><br>Jokneam was a city located near Mount Carmel, a significant geographical landmark in Israel. The Carmel region was known for its fertility and beauty, often associated with lush vegetation and vineyards. The city of Jokneam was later assigned to the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a>) and given to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>). The defeat of the "king of Jokneam" underscores the strategic victories achieved by the Israelites in securing key locations throughout Canaan. The reference to "one" again highlights the individual defeat of this king, contributing to the comprehensive list of conquered kings in <a href="/joshua/12.htm">Joshua 12</a>. Mount Carmel would later become the site of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18), symbolizing God's power and sovereignty over false gods.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_kedesh.htm">King of Kedesh</a></b><br>Kedesh was a city of refuge in the territory of Naphtali.

This matches the previous narrative of sweeping victory in northern Canaan (<a href="/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness shines through: every promise of land to Abraham&#8217;s descendants is being fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>; <a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p>&#8226; Kedesh would later become a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), demonstrating how God transforms former pagan strongholds into places of mercy for His people&#8212;an echo of <a href="/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a> where grace abounds all the more.<p>&#8226; The single tally reinforces that no enemy, however small, escaped judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>); it also provides Israel a concrete list for future remembrance (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king of Jokneam in Carmel, one</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Jokneam sat on the southwestern slope of Mount Carmel, later marked as a border city for Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a>) and assigned to the Merarite Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Its strategic hilltop location guarded the coastal plain; conquering it secured Israel&#8217;s access from the sea inward, fulfilling <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>.<p>&#8226; Carmel would later witness Elijah&#8217;s showdown with Baal&#8217;s prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>).
