The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a tribal inheritance like the other tribes of Israel. The fields and villages were given to Caleb, highlighting the distinction between the Levitical cities and the surrounding agricultural land. This allocation reflects the broader distribution of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as detailed in the Book of Joshua. The Levites' role was to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple, emphasizing their dependence on the other tribes for sustenance, as they did not have their own land to cultivate.<p><b>to Caleb son of Jephunneh</b><br>Caleb, son of Jephunneh, was one of the two faithful spies (along with Joshua) who trusted in God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan, as recounted in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>. Because of his faithfulness, Caleb was promised a specific inheritance in the land (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). This inheritance was fulfilled when he was given Hebron and its surrounding areas (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-14</a>). Caleb's story is a testament to the rewards of faith and obedience to God. His possession of the land also serves as a type of Christ, who, through faithfulness, secures an inheritance for His people. Caleb's heritage as a Kenizzite, a group originally outside the Israelite tribes, underscores the inclusivity of God's promises to those who are faithful.<p><b>as his possession</b><br>The term "possession" indicates a permanent inheritance, a fulfillment of God's promise to Caleb. This concept of possession is significant in the biblical narrative, as it underscores the idea of God's faithfulness in granting the land He promised to the patriarchs. The land was not just a temporary dwelling place but a lasting inheritance for Caleb and his descendants. This mirrors the New Testament promise of an eternal inheritance for believers in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). Caleb's possession of the land is a tangible representation of God's covenant faithfulness and serves as a reminder of the spiritual inheritance promised to all who are faithful to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/caleb_son_of_jephunneh.htm">Caleb son of Jephunneh</a></b><br>A faithful spy from the tribe of Judah who, along with Joshua, trusted in God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan.

This conjunction reminds us that while everybody else was receiving portions according to God&#8217;s plan, a prior commitment already stood&#8212;one set apart from the Levitical allotment. God&#8217;s faithfulness to earlier promises never gets lost in the shuffle (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they had given</b><p>This action is deliberate and completed.

While the Levites receive cities for ministry, Caleb receives Hebron&#8217;s fields and villages, fulfilling a decades-old promise. Each phrase showcases a contrast, an act of obedient giving, the fullness of the land&#8217;s resources, the reward of steadfast faith, and a secured inheritance. The verse reassures us that God never overlooks a faithful servant and that every promise&#8212;great or small&#8212;will be honored right down to the last boundary marker.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fields.</span> The original is in the singular. We are not necessarily, therefore, to suppose that the land was mapped out into divisions analogous to our fields. Our word "land" would more accurately represent the meaning of the original, which refers to the arable and pasture land in the neighbourhood of the city, with the agricultural villages or homesteads dotted about it. Keil contends that the Levites only received as many houses within the city as they needed, and that the rest belonged to Caleb. Bahr, moreover ('Symbolik,' 2:49), supposed that the Levites dwelt with the other inhabitants of the city, and that the pasture land within the distance of 2,000 paces from the city was reserved for them, the rest of the land belonging to the inhabitants of the tribe (see note on Gezer, ch. 10:33). This seems the most probable explanation. The land in general was owned by the descendants of Caleb. But the Levites had certain pastures reserved for them, whither they drove their cattle (see note on suburbs, <a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). The special information about Hebron here again is worthy of notice. It is copied by the author of 1 Chronicles in ch. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But they had given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fields</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7704.htm">Strong's 7704: </a> </span><span class="str2">Field, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and villages</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1510;&#1461;&#1512;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;re&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">around the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Caleb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3612.htm">Strong's 3612: </a> </span><span class="str2">Caleb -- a son of Jephunneh and sent by Moses to spy out the land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jephunneh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1508;&#1467;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;p&#772;un&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3312.htm">Strong's 3312: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jephunneh -- father of Caleb, also an Asherite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as his possession.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1467;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;uz&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_272.htm">Strong's 272: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something seized, a possession</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/21-12.htm">Joshua 21:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/21-12.htm">OT History: Joshua 21:12 But they gave the fields (Josh.
