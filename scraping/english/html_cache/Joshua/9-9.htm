The claim of coming from a distant land was meant to convince the Israelites that they were not among the local Canaanite nations, whom Israel was commanded to destroy. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of forming alliances and treaties with distant nations to ensure mutual protection and trade benefits. The Gibeonites' strategy highlights the importance of discernment and the potential for deception in diplomatic relations.<p><b>&#8220;because of the fame of the LORD your God.&#8221;</b><br>The fame of the LORD refers to the widespread knowledge of God's mighty acts, which had reached even distant lands. This acknowledgment by the Gibeonites underscores the impact of God's miracles and judgments, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. It also fulfills the promise that God's name would be proclaimed among the nations (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>). The Gibeonites' recognition of God's fame contrasts with the Canaanites' fear and resistance, illustrating different responses to God's revelation.<p><b>&#8220;For we have heard the reports about Him:&#8221;</b><br>The reports about God had spread far and wide, indicating the effectiveness of oral tradition and communication in the ancient world. This phrase suggests that the Gibeonites were well-informed about Israel's history and God's interventions on their behalf. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make His deeds known among the nations (<a href="/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105:1</a>). The Gibeonites' awareness of these reports demonstrates the far-reaching influence of God's actions and the importance of testimony in spreading His renown.<p><b>&#8220;all that He did in Egypt,&#8221;</b><br>This refers to the miraculous events surrounding the Exodus, including the ten plagues, the Passover, and the crossing of the Red Sea. These events were foundational to Israel's identity and served as a testament to God's power and faithfulness. The mention of Egypt highlights the historical reality of these events and their significance in establishing God's covenant relationship with Israel. It also serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, as the Exodus prefigures the deliverance from sin through Jesus' sacrifice. The Gibeonites' knowledge of these events underscores the enduring impact of God's salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the city of Gibeon who deceived Joshua and the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.

Faith begins with hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), even if, in their case, it led to manipulation rather than surrender.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s victories were not private; God intended them as public testimony (<a href="/psalms/105-1.htm">Psalm 105:1-2</a>). Even deceptive listeners cannot deny what God has done.<p>&#8226; The line reminds believers that our lives broadcast reports about God&#8217;s character, prompting observers either toward genuine faith or, as here, toward self-protective compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all that He did in Egypt</b><p>&#8226; The exodus events&#8212;plagues, Passover, Red Sea&#8212;stood as God&#8217;s definitive rescue (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;14</a>). Forty years later they were still the headline among the nations.<p>&#8226; Egypt symbolized world power and oppression; God&#8217;s triumph there declared His supremacy over every idol (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning Egypt rather than recent victories at Jericho and Ai (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6&#8211;8</a>) bolstered the Gibeonites&#8217; claim of having traveled far; news from Egypt could plausibly reach distant lands.<p>&#8226; For Israel, hearing Egypt recalled their own salvation story, a reminder not to negotiate away obedience to the God who had redeemed them (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a> shows the Gibeonites presenting themselves as humble foreigners moved by the worldwide reputation of Israel&#8217;s God.

Who can looke for any better in pagans?" (Bp. Hall.) It is worthy of the craft of the Gibeonites that they evade the first question, and as it is of vital importance to the success of their mission, they throw their whole force upon the second. The course of conduct enjoined on Joshua had reached the ears of the Canaanitish peoples, as we learn from ver. 24. They also take good care to say nothing of the more recent successes of the Israelites. With consummate astuteness they confine themselves to the successes "beyond Jordan." No wonder such mastery of the arts of deceit should have imposed on the Israelites. But inasmuch as the historian lacked the stimulus of that "necessity" which is proverbially "the mother of invention," we must recognise here a sign of the genuineness of the narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Your servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
