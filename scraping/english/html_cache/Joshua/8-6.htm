The Israelites, under Joshua's leadership, are employing a tactic of deception to lure the men of Ai away from their fortified city. This reflects a common ancient warfare strategy where an apparent retreat is used to draw the enemy into a vulnerable position. The city of Ai, identified with the archaeological site of et-Tell, was strategically significant due to its location near Bethel and its control over the central highlands. This tactic also demonstrates the Israelites' reliance on divine guidance for victory, as God had instructed Joshua on this plan.<p><b>for they will say, &#8216;The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase references the previous defeat of the Israelites at Ai, as recorded in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>. The initial failure was due to Achan's sin, which led to God's displeasure and the Israelites' defeat. The memory of this defeat would have emboldened the men of Ai, making them overconfident and more likely to pursue the Israelites. This overconfidence is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, where God uses the pride of the enemy to bring about their downfall, as seen in the story of Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>.<p><b>So as we flee from them</b><br>The act of fleeing is part of the ruse to draw the enemy out. This tactic requires discipline and trust among the Israelite soldiers, as they must convincingly feign retreat without breaking ranks. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith, where the Israelites must trust in God's plan despite appearances. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God using the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the strong and wise, as articulated in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s foreknowledge, the value of obedient strategy, and His power to turn former defeat into triumph. By trusting and following the Lord&#8217;s precise instructions, Israel moves from shame to victory, showcasing that every circumstance&#8212;even apparent retreat&#8212;can serve God&#8217;s redemptive purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they will come.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">"and</span> they will come." <span class="cmt_word">We have drawn.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">caused to pluck away</span> (see note on Joshua 4:18).
