Shechem is where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Jacob settled after returning from Paddan Aram (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18-20</a>). It serves as a central place for covenant renewal, symbolizing continuity and fulfillment of God's promises. Archaeological evidence suggests Shechem was a major Canaanite city, later becoming a key Israelite center. This assembly underscores the unity of the tribes under Joshua's leadership and the importance of covenant faithfulness.<p><b>He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel,</b><br>Joshua calls together the nation's leadership, emphasizing the structured governance established among the Israelites. The elders, leaders, judges, and officers represent the various levels of authority and responsibility within the community. This gathering reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's society, where civil and religious duties are intertwined. The presence of these leaders highlights the importance of collective decision-making and accountability before God, ensuring that the covenant is upheld across all levels of society.<p><b>and they presented themselves before God.</b><br>The leaders' presentation before God signifies a formal and solemn occasion, likely involving rituals or sacrifices. This act of presenting themselves indicates submission and readiness to hear and obey God's commands. It echoes earlier instances where Israel stood before God, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>), reinforcing the idea of divine presence and authority. This moment foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers presenting themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), drawing a parallel between Israel's covenant renewal and the Christian call to holiness and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who guided the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness through history, the necessity of representative leadership, and the solemn accountability of presenting oneself before the sovereign God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XXIV.</span><p>(b) <span class= "bld">JOSHUA'S LAST CHARGE TO THE PEOPLE.</span><p>(1, 2) <span class= "bld">Joshua gathered all the tribes . . .</span>--At the former address the rulers alone appear to have been present; on this occasion <span class= "ital">all Israel </span>was gathered. And what is spoken is addressed to the people in the hearing of the rulers. In the speech that now follows Joshua briefly recapitulates the national history; he had not thought this necessary for the rulers. To them he had said, "Ye know;" but "the people" embraced many persons of but little thought and education, whom it was necessary to inform and remind and instruct, even as to the leading events of their national history. The simple lesson which Joshua's words are intended to enforce is the duty of <span class= "ital">serving Jehovah, </span>and <span class= "ital">serving Him alone. </span>It is the first great lesson of the old covenant. "I am Jehovah, thy God; thou shalt have no other gods beside Me." The ark of this covenant had brought them over Jordan into the promised land.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood.</span>--The flood, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the river--probably Euphrates, though it may be Jordan, or both.

But there is not the slightest MSS. authority for the reading, and it is contrary to all sound principles of criticism to resort to arbitrary emendations of the text. Besides, the LXX. itself reads <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span>, in ver. 26, and adds, "before the tabernacle of the God of Israel," words implied, but not expressed in the Hebrew. We are therefore driven to the supposition that this gathering was one yet more solemn than the one described in the previous chapter. The tabernacle was no doubt removed on this great occasion to Shechem. The locality, as Poole reminds us, was well calculated to inspire the Israelites with the deepest feelings. It was the scene of God's first covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6, 7</a>), and of the formal renewal of the covenant related in <a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2-4</a> (see note on vers. 23, 26), and in <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>, when the blessings and the curses were inscribed on Mount Gerizim and Ebal, and the place where Joseph's bones (ver. 32) were laid, possibly at this time, or if not, at the time when the blessings and curses were inscribed. And now, once again, a formal renewal of the covenant was demanded from Israel by their aged chieftain, before his voice should cease to be heard among them any more. Rosenmuller reminds us that Josephus, the Chaldee and Syriac translators, and the Aldine and Complutensian editions of the LXX. itself, have Sichem. Bishop Horsley makes the very reasonable suggestion that Shiloh was not as yet the name of a town, but possibly of the tabernacle itself, or the district in which it had been pitched. And he adds that Mizpeh and Sheehem, not Shiloh, appear to have been the places fixed upon for the gathering of the tribes (see <a href="/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> (cf. ver. 27); <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>). See, however, <a href="/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>, as well as <a href="/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-12.htm">Joshua 22:12</a>. Some additional probability is given to this view by the fact noticed above, that it is thought necessary to describe the situation of Shiloh in <a href="/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, and we may also fail to notice that the words translated "house of God" in <a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 26</a> in our version, is in reality Bethel, there being no "house of God" properly so called, but only the "tabernacle of the congregation." The tabernacle in that ease would be moved from place to place within the central district assigned to it, as necessity or convenience dictated. Hengstenberg objects to the idea that the tabernacle was moved to Shechem that it would have led to an idea that God was only present in His Holy Place, to which it is sufficient to <span class="accented">reply</span>, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this does not necessarily follow, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that such a conception was entertained, though erroneously, by some minds. <p>The Samaritan woman, for instance, supposed the Jews to believe that in Jerusalem only ought men to worship (<a href="/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>). When Hengstenberg says, however, that the meeting in the last chapter had reference to Israel from a theocratic and religious, and this one from an historical point of view, he is on firmer ground. The former exhortation is ethical, this historical. He goes on to refer to the deeply interesting historical traditions centering round this place, which have been noticed above. The oak in ver. 26, Hengstenberg maintains to be the same tree that is mentioned in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> (where our version has, erroneously, "plain"), and which is referred to both in <a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> and here <span class="accented">as the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>, the well known) terebinth in Shechem (see note on ver. 26). He has overlooked the fact that the tree in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> is not an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> but an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. He goes on to contend that the terebinth was not merely "by" but "in" the sanctuary of the Lord, which he supposes to be another sanctuary beside the tabernacle, perhaps the sacred enclosure round Abraham's altar. But he is wrong, as has been shown below, (ver. 26), when he says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> never signifies near (see Joshua 5:25). The question is one of much difficulty, and cannot be satisfactorily settled. But we may dismiss without fear, in the light of the narative in ch. 22, Knobel's suggestion that an altar was erected here on this occasion. If there were any altar, it must have been the altar in the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Other gods.</span> That the family of Nahor were not exactly worshippers of the one true God in the same pure ritual as Abraham, may be gathered from the fact that Laban had teraphim (<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19, 30</a>). But recent researches have thrown some light on the condition of Abraham's family and ancestors. If Ur Casdim be identified, as recent discoverers have supposed, with Mugeyer, which, though west of Euphrates as a whole, is yet to the eastward of one of its subordinate channels (see 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arebaeology,' 3:229; Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 4), its ruins give us plentiful information concerning the creed of its inhabitants. We may also find some information about this primeval city in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, and in Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' p. 233. The principal building of this city is the temple of the moon god Ur. One of the liturgical hymns to this moon god is in existence, and has been translated into French by M. Lenormant. In it the moon is addressed as Father, earth enlightening god, primeval seer, giver of life, king of kings, and the like. The sun and stars seem also to have been objects of worship, and a highly developed polytheistic system seems to have culminated in the horrible custom of human sacrifices. This was a recognised practice among the early Accadians, a Turanian race which preceded the Semitic in these regions. A fragment of an early Accadian hymn has been preserved, in which the words "his offspring for his life he gave" occur, and it seems that the Semitic people of Ur adopted it from them. A similar view is attributed to Balak in <a href="/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5, 6</a>, and was probably derived from documents which have since perished (see Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p 24). Hence, no doubt the Moloch, or Molech, worship which was common in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and which the descendants of Abraham on their first entrance thither rejected with such disgust (see also <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where Abraham seems to have some difficulties connected with his ancestral creed). Other deities were worshipped in the Ur of the Chaldees. Sumas, the sun god, Nana, the equivalent of Astarte, the daughter of the moon god, Bel and Belat, "his lady." "In truth," says Mr. Tomkins, in the work above cited, "polytheism was stamped on the earth in temples and towers, and the warlike and beneficent works of kings. Rimmon was the patron of the all-important irrigation, Sin of brickmaking and building, Nergal of war." A full account of these deities will be found in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1435;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">assembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1462;&#1505;&#1465;&#1447;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#183;&#8217;e&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
