They were allotted a portion of the Promised Land, but they felt it was insufficient for their growing population. This sentiment highlights the challenges of land distribution among the tribes of Israel and the need for faith and reliance on God's provision. The hill country, while fertile, was rugged and required significant effort to cultivate, which may have contributed to their dissatisfaction.<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The response is directed to Joshua, the leader of Israel, who was responsible for dividing the land among the tribes. This interaction underscores the ongoing dialogue and negotiation between the tribes and their leader, reflecting the communal and covenantal nature of Israelite society.<p><b>and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots,</b><br>The mention of Canaanites with iron chariots indicates the formidable military technology possessed by the inhabitants of the land. Iron chariots were a significant advantage in ancient warfare, suggesting that the Israelites faced a daunting challenge in conquering these areas. This detail emphasizes the need for reliance on God's power rather than human strength, as seen in other biblical narratives where God delivers victory despite overwhelming odds (e.g., Gideon's victory in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>).<p><b>both in Beth-shean with its towns</b><br>Beth-shean was a significant Canaanite city located in the Jordan Valley. Its strategic position made it a key location for controlling trade routes and military movements. Archaeological excavations have revealed its importance and the presence of Canaanite and later Egyptian influences. The reference to "its towns" suggests a network of settlements under Beth-shean's control, indicating the complexity and strength of Canaanite urban centers.<p><b>and in the Valley of Jezreel.</b><br>The Valley of Jezreel, also known as the Plain of Esdraelon, was a fertile and strategically important region in northern Israel. It served as a major crossroads for trade and military campaigns. The valley's significance is seen throughout biblical history, including battles such as those involving Deborah and Barak (Judges 4-5) and later conflicts involving the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.

Jezreel abutted on the great plain of Esdraelon, a name which is but a corruption of Jezreel (see note on Joshua 19:18), where the chariots of iron could be used with effect, a thing impossible in the mountain districts. Hence the fact that the hill country of Palestine was more rapidly and permanently occupied than the plains (see Ewald, 'History,' 22 C., and Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' 2:328. Cf. <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>, and note on Joshua 11:6).
