The crossing signifies a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan. It echoes the earlier crossing of the Red Sea, highlighting God's continued faithfulness and miraculous provision. The orderly crossing underscores the unity and obedience of the people under Joshua's leadership, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>the priests with the ark of the LORD</b><br>The priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant symbolize God's presence among His people. The Ark, containing the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, represents God's covenant, guidance, and provision. The priests' role in carrying the Ark emphasizes the importance of spiritual leadership and the centrality of God's presence in the life of the nation. This act also prefigures Christ, our High Priest, who mediates God's presence to us (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>crossed in the sight of the people</b><br>The visibility of the priests and the Ark during the crossing serves as a powerful reminder of God's leadership and protection. It reassures the Israelites of God's continued presence as they face the challenges of conquering Canaan. This public demonstration of faith and obedience reinforces the importance of communal witness and accountability. It also foreshadows the public nature of Christ's ministry and His role as the visible manifestation of God's presence (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_lord.htm">The Ark of the LORD</a></b><br>A sacred chest that represented God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>The Levitical priests who carried the Ark of the LORD and led the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites miraculously crossed to enter Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land that God had sworn to give to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The crossing of the Jordan River is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises.

God&#8217;s faithfulness is highlighted: He promised safe passage (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>) and fulfilled it completely (<a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording echoes <a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>, where &#8220;the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground,&#8221; drawing a deliberate parallel between the Red Sea and the Jordan crossings.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a> reminds believers that when they &#8220;pass through the waters,&#8221; the Lord is with them, reinforcing that this historical event models an ongoing promise of divine presence.<p>&#8226; By waiting until &#8220;everyone&#8221; had crossed, the Lord shows His shepherd-like care (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a>) for the entire covenant community, not just a select few.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed</b><p>Only after the nation is secure do the priests step out of the riverbed, carrying the Ark&#8212;the tangible sign of God&#8217;s throne and covenant (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a> had the priests take the lead; now they bring up the rear, bracketing the crossing with God&#8217;s presence at both the beginning and the end.<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a> underscores that only the priests could handle these holy objects, showing the seriousness of approaching God.<p>&#8226; The Ark&#8217;s movement signals that the miracle is finished; the same power that stopped the water now releases it, much like the Red Sea closed only after Israel was safe (<a href="/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-15</a> later pictures the Ark leading joyful procession; here it anchors a solemn, saving moment, illustrating that God&#8217;s presence both delivers and directs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of the people.</b><p>Nothing about this scene is hidden. The entire nation watches as the priests emerge, reinforcing several truths:<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a> promised that the LORD would exalt Joshua &#8220;in the sight of all Israel.&#8221; By timing the priests&#8217; exit to public view, God authenticates Joshua&#8217;s leadership.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a> notes that Israel &#8220;saw the great power&#8221; at the Red Sea and &#8220;feared the LORD.&#8221; A similar awe is intended here&#8212;faith is stirred by witnessing God&#8217;s acts (<a href="/psalms/98-2.htm">Psalm 98:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Public affirmation strengthens community memory. The memorial stones set up immediately afterward (<a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20-24</a>) rely on eyewitness testimony to teach future generations.<p>&#8226; When God works openly, He cultivates accountability; the people can no longer doubt His presence or their own calling to obey (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/4-11.htm">Joshua 4:11</a> presents the orderly conclusion of a miraculous crossing: every Israelite first reaches safety, then the priests carrying the Ark step out, all before the watching nation. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithful protection, the centrality of His presence, and the public validation of both His power and Joshua&#8217;s leadership. Together these elements encourage believers to trust the Lord who leads, sustains, and completes what He starts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1469;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
