It is believed to be situated in the Negev region, which is a desert area in southern Israel. The exact location of Azmon is not definitively known today, but it is thought to be near the modern-day border between Israel and Egypt. This area was significant as it marked the boundary of the Promised Land given to the Israelites. The mention of Azmon highlights the importance of clearly defined borders in the ancient world, which were crucial for maintaining tribal territories and ensuring peace among neighboring peoples.<p><b>joined the Brook of Egypt</b><br>The "Brook of Egypt" is traditionally identified with the Wadi El-Arish, a seasonal riverbed that flows into the Mediterranean Sea. This brook served as a natural boundary between the land of Canaan and Egypt. In biblical times, it was a significant geographical marker that delineated the extent of the land promised to the Israelites. The use of natural features like rivers and brooks for borders was common in ancient times, providing clear and recognizable boundaries. This brook is also mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a> and <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>, reinforcing its role as a significant border marker.<p><b>and ended at the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" referred to here is the Mediterranean Sea, which formed the western boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Judah. The Mediterranean Sea was a crucial feature for trade and travel in the ancient world, providing access to other cultures and economies. For the Israelites, having a border that reached the sea symbolized the fulfillment of God's promise to give them a land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The sea also served as a natural defense against potential invaders from the west.<p><b>This was their southern border</b><br>The southern border of Judah was significant not only for its geographical implications but also for its theological symbolism. It represented the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give their descendants a specific land. The delineation of borders was essential for maintaining the identity and unity of the Israelite tribes. This border also served as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of obedience to His commands in order to maintain the blessings of the land. The southern border, along with the other borders of the Promised Land, is a testament to God's provision and the establishment of His people in a land of their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azmon.htm">Azmon</a></b><br>A location marking part of the southern boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Judah.

Azmon lay in the arid southwest, beyond Kadesh-barnea, close to the wilderness of Zin. By naming the spot, Scripture fixes the line in real geography, just as <a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4-5</a> records: &#8220;the border will turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt.&#8221; The land promise in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a> (&#8220;To your offspring I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates&#8221;) is beginning to look concrete and measurable.

In other words, Judah&#8217;s allotment stretched right up to the threshold of the great empire that had once enslaved them. The precise wording underscores two truths:<p>&#8226; God grants borders that protect His people.<p>&#8226; God sets limits that keep them distinct from surrounding nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ended at the Sea</b><p>The line reaches &#8220;the Sea,&#8221; the Mediterranean. <a href="/joshua/15-12.htm">Joshua 15:12</a> later calls it &#8220;the Great Sea.&#8221; Once the boundary touched water, the point was fixed and unmistakable. <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> had forecast this coast-to-coast promise: &#8220;I will set your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines.&#8221; The western shoreline provided Judah with trade, food, and a constant reminder of God&#8217;s vast provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This was their southern border</b><p>With one concise sentence, Scripture wraps up the southern line.

"This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth" was the instruction to Joshua, and in describing the border of Judah, he is really describing also the southern border of all Israel; and he does it throughout in language very like that of Moses in Numbers 34. But Moses wrote it in the second person and in the future tense throughout; Joshua wrote it in the third person and in the past tense, with this one exception, in which he seems to have unconsciously adopted the phraseology of the lawgiver instead of the historian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The river of Egypt</span> (see above, <a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>).
