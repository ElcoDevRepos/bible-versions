This moment is significant as it marks the renewal of the covenant at Shechem. Joshua's role as a leader is reminiscent of Moses, who also gathered the people to hear God's commands. This setting underscores the importance of communal worship and obedience to God.<p><b>This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says</b><br>Joshua speaks as a prophet, delivering a message directly from God. The title "the God of Israel" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and the nation of Israel. This phrase highlights God's authority and the importance of His words, which are not merely historical but carry divine instruction and promise.<p><b>Long ago your fathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor</b><br>The mention of Terah, Abraham, and Nahor situates the Israelites within a historical and familial context. Terah's family is significant as it marks the beginning of God's covenantal relationship with Abraham, which is foundational to Israel's identity. This reference serves as a reminder of their heritage and God's faithfulness through generations.<p><b>lived beyond the Euphrates</b><br>This geographical reference to the region beyond the Euphrates River, likely in Mesopotamia, indicates the origin of Abraham's family.

This journey is a type of the spiritual journey of faith and obedience that God calls His people to undertake.<p><b>and worshiped other gods</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the idolatrous background of Abraham's family before God's call. It serves as a reminder of God's grace in choosing Abraham and setting him apart for a unique purpose. This transformation from idolatry to faith in the one true God is a precursor to the call for Israel to forsake other gods and serve the LORD alone, a theme that resonates throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

It is worthy of notice that there is no evidence of the growth of a myth in the narrative here. We have a simple abstract of the history given us in the Pentateuch, without the slightest addition, and certainly without the invention of any further miraculous details. All this goes to establish the position that we have here a simple unvarnished history of what occurred. The manufacture of prodigies, as every mythical history, down to the biographies of Dominic and Francis, tells us, is a process that cannot stand still. Each successive narrator deems it to be his duty to embellish his narrative with fresh marvels. Compare this with the historical abridgment before us, and we must at least acknowledge that we are in the presence of phenomena of a very different ruder. Professor Goldziher has argued, in his 'Mythology among the Hebrews,' that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob are solar myths, such as we find in immense abundance in Cox's 'Aryan Mythology.' Abraham (father of height)is the nightly sky. Sarah (princess) is the moon. Isaac (he shall laugh) is the smiling sunset or dawn. It would be difficult to find any history which, by an exercise of similar ingenuity, might not be resolved into myths. Napoleon Bonaparte, for instance, might be resolved into the rushing onset of the conqueror who was never defeated. The retreat from Moscow is a solar myth of the most obvious description. The battle of Bull's Run is clearly so named from the cowardice displayed there by the sons of John Bull. It is remarked by Mr. Tomkins that Ur, the city of the moon god, lends itself most naturally to the fabricator of myths. There is only one objection to the theory, and that is the bricks, still in existence, stamped with the words Urn, which compel us to descend from this delightful cloud land of fancy to the more sober regions of solid and literal fact (see 'Studies on the Times of Abraham,' pp. 205-207). In old time. Literally, <span class="accented">from everlasting, i.e</span>, from time immemorial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The Rabbinic tradition has great probability in it, that Abraham was driven out of his native country for refusing to worship idols. It is difficult to understand his call otherwise. No doubt his great and pure soul had learned to abhor the idolatrous and cruel worship of his countrymen. By inward struggles, perhaps by the vague survival of the simpler and truer faith which has been held to underlie every polytheistic system, he had "reached a purer air," and learned to adore the One True God. His family were led to embrace his doctrines, and they left their native land with him. But Haran, with its star worship, was no resting place for him. So he journeyed on westward, leaving the society of men, and preserving himself from temptation by his nomad life. No wandering Bedouin, as some would have us believe (see Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 18), but a prince, on equal terms with Abimelech and Pharaoh, and capable of overthrowing the mighty conqueror of Elam. Such an example might well be brought to the memory of his descendants, who were now to be sojourners in the land promised to their father. Guided by conscience alone, with every external influence against him, he had worshipped the true God in that land.
