It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The Israelites' compliance is significant as it demonstrates their faith and trust in God's plan. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Pentateuch, where blessings are often contingent upon adherence to God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The phrase also underscores the leadership transition from Moses to Joshua, as Joshua continues to implement the divine directives given to Moses.<p><b>and they divided the land</b><br>The division of the land among the tribes of Israel is a pivotal moment in the history of the Israelites, marking the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settlement in the Promised Land. This division was not arbitrary but followed specific instructions given by God, ensuring each tribe received its inheritance (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). The allocation of land is detailed in the subsequent chapters of Joshua, emphasizing the importance of each tribe's role in the nation of Israel. This act of dividing the land also fulfills the covenantal promise made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, signifying God's faithfulness. Theologically, the land serves as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, with the division symbolizing the rest and provision found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were chosen by God to inherit the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who guided and commanded the Israelites throughout their journey.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Law from God.
