Her story is a powerful example of redemption and faith, as she recognized the God of Israel as the true God (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>). Her inclusion in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) underscores the transformative power of faith and God's willingness to use anyone for His purposes.<p><b>with her father&#8217;s household and all who belonged to her</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the salvation extended to Rahab. It reflects the biblical principle that faith can have a protective and redemptive impact on one's family (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>). The sparing of her household also demonstrates the fulfillment of the promise made by the spies (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12-14</a>).<p><b>because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho</b><br>Rahab's actions were a demonstration of her faith in the God of Israel. By hiding the spies, she aligned herself with God's people, risking her life in the process. This act of faith is commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>, where Rahab is listed among the heroes of faith. Her actions also illustrate the theme of divine providence and protection for those who trust in God.<p><b>So she has lived among the Israelites to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the integration of Rahab into the community of Israel, symbolizing the acceptance and inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant people. Her continued presence among the Israelites serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, a theme further developed in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).

The text openly calls her a prostitute, yet her faith overshadows her former life (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>).<p>- Joshua&#8217;s act of sparing her springs from covenant faithfulness. Just as God honors faith wherever it is found, Joshua honors the oath made by the spies (<a href="/joshua/2-14.htm">Joshua 2:14</a>).<p>- This points forward to God&#8217;s pattern of redeeming unlikely people&#8212;think of Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="/ruth/4-5.htm">Ruth 4:5</a>) and the thief on the cross (<a href="/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With her father&#8217;s household and all who belonged to her</b><p>&#8220;with her father&#8217;s household and all who belonged to her&#8221;.<p>- Salvation in this moment is corporate as well as individual. Rahab&#8217;s decision affected her entire family, echoing the household deliverance promised to the Philippian jailer (<a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31-34</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s mercy extends beyond personal rescue to family blessing, just as Noah&#8217;s family entered the ark through his righteousness (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>).<p>- Jericho&#8217;s judgment was total (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>), so this preservation highlights God&#8217;s ability to shelter His people even in the midst of destruction (<a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho</b><p>&#8220;because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho&#8221;.<p>- The verse plainly gives the reason: Rahab acted in faith, risking her life (<a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4-6</a>).<p>- Works validated her faith (<a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>); her hiding the spies was not mere hospitality but allegiance to Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>).<p>- Her action fulfilled the principle that those who bless God&#8217;s people are blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So she has lived among the Israelites to this day</b><p>&#8220;So she has lived among the Israelites to this day&#8221;.<p>- Rahab was not just spared; she was integrated into the covenant community.

"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot <span class= "ital">justified by works?</span>" (<a href="/james/2-25.htm" title="Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?">James 2:25</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day.</span>--"Salmon begat Booz of Rachab" seems certainly to refer to her (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm" title="And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;">Matthew 1:5</a>), though why she is called <span class= "ital">Rachab </span>in that place is not obvious. Rachab is not the usual form of the word, either in the LXX. or in the other passages of the Greek text where she is named. It is not simply a variation in the English spelling, but a difference in the original Greek. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto this day.</span> This may either be interpreted of herself, or, according to s common Hebrew idiom, of her family (cf. <a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-17.htm">Joshua 24:17</a>). For a fuller discussion of the bearing of this passage on the date of the Book of Joshua, see Introduction. There is no mention of Rahab's marriage in the Old Testament. Lightfoot ('Hebrew and Talmudicai Exercitations?' <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) mentions a tradition that she married <span class="accented">Joshua!</span> Dr. W. H. Mill, in his treatise on the genealogies of our Lord, defends the tradition St. Matthew has followed by showing that Salmon's age at the time gives immense probability to the statement. Some (see the Bishop of Bath and Wells' article in Smith's ' Dictionary of the Bible') suppose that Salmon was one of the spies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/6-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
