The concept of "inheritance" is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The division of the land among the tribes of Israel was a significant event, symbolizing God's faithfulness and the realization of His promises. The term "allotted" indicates a deliberate and divinely guided distribution, reflecting God's sovereignty and the importance of each tribe's role in the nation of Israel.<p><b>these remaining nations</b><br>The "remaining nations" refer to the Canaanite peoples who still inhabited parts of the Promised Land. Despite the Israelites' victories, not all the land was fully conquered, and some Canaanite groups persisted. This situation served as a test of Israel's faithfulness and obedience to God's commands to fully possess the land (<a href="/judges/2-20.htm">Judges 2:20-23</a>). The presence of these nations also foreshadowed future challenges and conflicts, highlighting the need for Israel to rely on God's strength and guidance.<p><b>including all the nations I have already cut off</b><br>This phrase recalls the victories God granted Israel over various Canaanite kings and peoples during the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership. The phrase "I have already cut off" underscores God's active role in delivering these enemies into Israel's hands, fulfilling His promise to fight for them (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27-31</a>). It also serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness, encouraging the Israelites to trust Him for future victories.<p><b>from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea</b><br>Geographically, this phrase defines the extent of the land promised to Israel, stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Great Sea. This area encompasses the heart of the Promised Land, including significant regions such as the hill country, the coastal plains, and the Shephelah. The boundaries reflect the land's strategic and fertile nature, essential for the nation's sustenance and security. The mention of these boundaries also connects to earlier promises made to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>) and highlights the fulfillment of God's covenantal promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

This, however, need not of necessity be imputed to them as a sin. For, as we have seen, the conquest was to be gradual. No doubt there was enough to be done in consolidating the conquests already made, in settling the tribes in their possessions, to occupy all the days of Joshua, and even possibly a longer period. At least we may he sure that, as long as Joshua lived, the heathen settlements were kept distinct from the Israelitish community, that intermarriages were not allowed, nor rights of citizenship granted to any but the Gibeonites. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> Joshua's speech here exactly agrees with the statements in <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-41</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11, 14, 21</a>.
