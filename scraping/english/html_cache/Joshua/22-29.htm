Rebellion against God is seen as a grave sin, often leading to severe consequences, as seen in the stories of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3) and the Israelites in the wilderness (Numbers 14). The phrase reflects a deep commitment to faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and turn away from Him today</b><br>Turning away from God is synonymous with apostasy, a recurring issue for the Israelites. The historical context here involves the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who settled east of the Jordan River. Their geographical separation from the rest of Israel raised concerns about their potential spiritual separation. This phrase underscores the importance of remaining steadfast in faith and the dangers of spiritual complacency.<p><b>by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices</b><br>The construction of altars was a significant aspect of worship in ancient Israel. However, unauthorized altars were forbidden, as they could lead to idolatry or false worship. The Law of Moses specified that sacrifices should be made only at the designated place of worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of adhering to God's prescribed methods of worship and the potential for altars to become a source of division or false worship.<p><b>other than the altar of the LORD our God</b><br>This refers to the central altar located at the tabernacle, which was the only legitimate place for sacrifices. The tabernacle, and later the temple, was the focal point of Israelite worship, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This phrase reinforces the unity of worship and the centralization of religious practices as commanded by God.<p><b>which stands before His tabernacle.</b><br>The tabernacle was the portable dwelling place for the divine presence during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and their early years in the Promised Land. It was a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This phrase emphasizes the importance of the tabernacle as the legitimate center of worship and the place where God chose to reveal His presence to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eastern_tribes.htm">The Eastern Tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh)</a></b><br>These tribes were given land on the east side of the Jordan River and were returning to their inheritance after helping the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas,_son_of_eleazar_the_priest.htm">Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest</a></b><br>He was sent by the Israelites to confront the Eastern tribes about the altar they built, fearing it was an act of rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar_of_witness.htm">The Altar of Witness</a></b><br>The altar built by the Eastern tribes near the Jordan River, intended as a witness between them and the other Israelites that they all serve the same God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where the altar of the LORD was located, signifying the proper place for sacrifices and offerings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_canaan.htm">The Land of Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land west of the Jordan River, where the majority of the Israelite tribes settled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_worship.htm">Unity in Worship</a></b><br>The altar was a symbol of unity among the tribes, reminding us of the importance of maintaining unity in our worship practices today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_idolatry.htm">Guarding Against Idolatry</a></b><br>The Israelites' concern over the altar reflects the need to guard against idolatry and ensure our worship aligns with God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_god's_honor.htm">Zeal for God's Honor</a></b><br>Phinehas' involvement shows the importance of being zealous for God's honor and purity in worship, a trait we should emulate.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/communication_and_understanding.htm">Communication and Understanding</a></b><br>The resolution of the conflict through dialogue highlights the importance of communication and understanding in resolving disputes within the faith community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_future_generations.htm">Witness to Future Generations</a></b><br>The altar served as a witness to future generations, reminding us of the importance of leaving a legacy of faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_22_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 22:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_22_29_on_loyalty_to_God.htm">How does Joshua 22:29 emphasize the importance of loyalty to God's commands?
