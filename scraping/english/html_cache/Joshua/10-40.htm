This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of Joshua's military campaign, emphasizing the totality of the victory. The conquest is not just a series of isolated battles but a strategic and divinely guided campaign to establish Israel in the Promised Land.<p><b>the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes,</b><br>These geographical areas represent the diverse topography of Canaan. The hill country refers to the central mountainous region, the Negev is the arid southern desert, the foothills (or Shephelah) are the lowlands between the mountains and the coastal plain, and the slopes likely refer to the transitional areas. Each area had its own strategic and economic significance, and conquering them demonstrated Israel's control over the entire land.<p><b>together with all their kings&#8212;</b><br>The mention of kings highlights the political structure of Canaan, which was composed of city-states each ruled by its own king. Defeating these kings was crucial for dismantling the existing power structures and establishing Israelite dominance. This also underscores the divine assistance Joshua received, as these kings were formidable opponents.<p><b>leaving no survivors.</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of herem, or the ban, which was a command to completely destroy certain peoples and their possessions. This was not merely a military strategy but a theological act of judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness. It also served to protect Israel from the influence of pagan practices.<p><b>He devoted to destruction everything that breathed,</b><br>The phrase indicates the totality of the destruction, emphasizing the complete eradication of the Canaanite presence. This was intended to purify the land and prevent the Israelites from being led astray by Canaanite religious practices. It also serves as a sobering reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness of sin.<p><b>just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.</b><br>This underscores the divine mandate behind Joshua's actions. The conquest was not merely a human endeavor but an act of obedience to God's specific instructions. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's commands was paramount. This obedience is a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, who led the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill_country,_negev,_foothills,_and_slopes.htm">The Hill Country, Negev, Foothills, and Slopes</a></b><br>These are geographical regions in Canaan that Joshua and the Israelites conquered.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings_of_canaan.htm">The Kings of Canaan</a></b><br>Local rulers who opposed Israel and were defeated by Joshua.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The divine commander who instructed Joshua to carry out the conquest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/devoted_to_destruction.htm">Devoted to Destruction</a></b><br>A term indicating the complete destruction of the inhabitants and their possessions as an act of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Joshua's actions demonstrate the importance of following God's instructions completely, even when they are difficult or challenging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_mercy.htm">Divine Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>The destruction of the Canaanites serves as a reminder of God's judgment against sin, but also His mercy in providing a way for salvation through faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The physical battles in Joshua's time can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual battles Christians face today, emphasizing the need for reliance on God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>The command to destroy the Canaanites underscores the call for believers to live holy lives, separate from the sinful practices of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_action.htm">Faith and Action</a></b><br>Joshua's leadership exemplifies the balance of faith in God's promises and the action required to see those promises fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_10_40_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 10:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_40_God_s_conquest_command.htm">How does Joshua 10:40 demonstrate God's command to conquer the Promised Land?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_left_no_survivors_mean.htm">What does "left no survivors" reveal about God's judgment in Joshua 10:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Joshua_10_40_to_spiritual_battles.htm">How can we apply Joshua's obedience in Joshua 10:40 to our spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_10_40_to_Abraham_s_promises.htm">What connections exist between Joshua 10:40 and God's promises to Abraham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_40_Trust_God_s_victory_plan.htm">How does Joshua 10:40 encourage us to trust God's plan for victory today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_40_and_a_loving_just_God.htm">How does Joshua 10:40 align with the concept of a loving and just God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Joshua_10_40_historically_accurate.htm">Does the historical evidence support the events described in Joshua 10:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_40_s_theological_meaning.htm">What is the theological significance of Joshua's conquests in Joshua 10:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_joshua_15_63_align_with_total_conquest.htm">Joshua 15:63 states that the men of Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites from Jerusalem;

It was once more fertile than it is at present, but could never have been a very fruitful region. As Knobel says, it is midway between waste and fertile land. It possesses grass and herbs and flowers, especially in the rainy season, and is thus suitable for pasture. But there are many tracts of sand and heath, and it is not watered by brooks, characteristics it has in common with the wilderness. It was also hilly, though not so precipitous as the mountain district. Tristram ('Land of Israel,' pp. 365, 366) describes some of the mountains as rising gradually to a height of 3,200 feet. Bartlett, however, who devoted more time to the south country, describes it as treeless, but fertile as a corn producing country, and as very distinct in its physical features from the desert, or what is known as the "Wilderness of Judaea" ('From Egypt to Palestine,' ch. 17, 18.). The best description of this region is found, however, in 'Scripture Lands,' by the late Rev. G. S. Drew. He says (p. 6), "For a few weeks late in spring time a smiling aspect is thrown over the broad downs, when the ground is reddened by the anemone in contrast with the soft white of the daisy and the deep yellow of the tulip and marigold. But this flush of beauty soon passes, and the permanent aspect of the country is not wild indeed, or hideous, or frightfully desolate, but, as we may say, austerely plain; a tame, unpleasing aspect, not causing absolute discomfort while one is in it, but left without one lingering reminiscence of anything lovely, awful, or sublime." The rocks are occasionally rendered fertile by the system of terrace cultivation, more common, as almost every traveller since Maundrell has remarked, in former times than now. That keen observer remarks, that if any one were to object that Palestine could not have maintained the vast population stated in Scripture to have inhabited it, he would be confuted by the fact that the most cursory observation shows that "the very rocks were made fruitful," perhaps even to a greater extent than plains could be, "by this method." The "vale," or Shephelah (see note on Joshua 9:1), was a low strip of coast extending from the foot of Carmel to near Gaza. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, or "springs, as it is translated in our version (better, "watercourses," or "slopes," as Knobel),was a fertile country, intersected by ravines and brooks, situated between the mountains and the sea. The word only occurs in the Pentateuch and Joshua (a fact to be noted in forming an opinion on the genuineness of these books). See <a href="/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a> (where it is translated <span class="accented">stream</span> in our version; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>. The root, signifying <span class="accented">pouring forth</span>, is found in Chaldee and Syriac. The LXX. renders this, as well as "the south," strange to say, as a proper name. See note on Joshua 15:19. The Vulgate follows its example in the former case, but not in the latter. The Syriac also renders as a proper name. <span class="cmt_word">Utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.</span> See for the word translated "utterly destroyed," <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>. These words are a quotation from <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16, 17</a>. It seems impossible to evade one of the alternatives, either that Deuteronomy was written before the events recorded in the book of Joshua, or that we have no historical evidence that Joshua <span class="accented">did</span> "utterly destroy all that breathed." The hypothesis that the Divine sanction for such a war of extermination was invented centuries after the Israelites had come to terms with the inhabitants and were daily utterly violating its spirit, and that they then readily allowed themselves to believe it to be of Divine origin, will scarcely bear examination. The attitude of the people toward Gentiles after their captivity is only to be explained by the hypothesis that it was the result of a belief that their misfortunes were due to a law which they had previously received and neglected to obey. Calvin observes how thoroughly these passages bear witness to the fact that the Israelites felt themselves to be the ministers of a Divine purpose in this slaughter. Origen (Hom. 15 on Joshua) says that the Apostles gave order that the Scriptures of the Old Testament were to be read in church, which, he adds, "they would not have done had not these carnal wars prefigured the spiritual warfare which we have to carry on against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.'" <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span>. Hebrew <span class="accented">Azzah</span> (or <span class="accented">strong</span>), as in <a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>. Joshua's conquests extended to, but did not comprise, Gaza (<a href="/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2, 3</a>). It was to have been the uttermost limit of the Israelitish <span class="accented">territory</span> (<span class="accented">see Genesis</span> 10:19). It actually was so in the days of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>). But until then the Israelites had not been able to subdue it, though (<a href="/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45-47</a>) the whole land of the Philistines was assigned to Judah. What results this failure produced upon the after history of Israel we read in the Books of Judges and Samuel. Not till the reign of David was the Philistine power entirely broken. And Gaza played a very important part in the Philistine confederation. See <a href="/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1-4, 21 -23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-16.htm">1 Samuel 6:16, 17</a>. Gaza has retained its importance even to the present day. Its situation near the sea, and, still more, its position upon the high road from Palestine to Egypt, and from the Mediterranean to Arabia Petraea, have secured it this permanence. When Robinson visited it its population was between fifteen and sixteen thousand - larger even than that of Jerusalem. And it seems to have largely increased in population since the beginning of the century. <span class="cmt_word">Goshen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;</span> LXX. Not, of course, identical with the land of Goshen in Egypt, but inasmuch as it lay to the southeast of Palestine, in the direction of their former habitation, it may possibly have been so named in memory of that sojourn. A city of that name is mentioned in the mountains of Judah, together with Debir (<a href="/joshua/15-51.htm">Joshua 15:51</a>). It clearly (<a href="/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>) refers to a large district in the southeast, but its precise locality is not known. <span class="cmt_word">Even unto Gibeon.</span> The conquests of Israel did not extend further in the northwest than Gibeon, from whence Joshua had set out on his triumphant campaign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">conquered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yak&#183;keh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
