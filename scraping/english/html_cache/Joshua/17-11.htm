This allocation within the territories of Issachar and Asher highlights the complex nature of tribal boundaries in ancient Israel. The division of land was a fulfillment of God's promise to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The presence of Manasseh in these regions indicates the tribe's significant influence and the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Ephraim and Manasseh are promised to become great peoples.<p><b>Beth-shean</b><br>Beth-shean was a strategically important city located at the junction of the Jordan Valley and the Jezreel Valley. It was known for its fertile land and served as a key military and trade center. Archaeological excavations have revealed a wealth of artifacts from various periods, indicating its long history of occupation. In <a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, it is mentioned as the place where the Philistines displayed the bodies of Saul and his sons after their defeat at Mount Gilboa.<p><b>Ibleam</b><br>Ibleam was a town located near the Jezreel Valley. It is mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>, where King Ahaziah of Judah fled to Megiddo after being wounded at Ibleam. The town's location made it a significant site for controlling the trade routes and military movements in the region.<p><b>Dor (that is, Naphath)</b><br>Dor was a coastal city known for its maritime activities and trade. The term "Naphath" refers to the surrounding region or district. Dor's location on the Mediterranean coast made it a valuable asset for trade and cultural exchange. It is mentioned in <a href="/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a> as a city that the Israelites struggled to fully conquer, indicating the presence of Canaanite influence.<p><b>Endor</b><br>Endor is famously known as the location where King Saul consulted a medium before his final battle against the Philistines, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a>. This act of seeking guidance from a medium was against God's commandments, highlighting Saul's desperation and spiritual decline. The town's mention here underscores its historical and spiritual significance.<p><b>Taanach</b><br>Taanach was a city located in the Jezreel Valley, known for its strategic military importance. It is mentioned in <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> as one of the sites of the battle between the Canaanite kings and the Israelites led by Deborah and Barak. The city's location made it a key point for controlling the valley and its surrounding areas.<p><b>and Megiddo</b><br>Megiddo is one of the most significant archaeological sites in Israel, known for its historical and prophetic importance. It was a major city-state in ancient times, controlling the trade routes between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Megiddo is also associated with the prophetic "Armageddon" in <a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>, symbolizing the final battle between good and evil. Its strategic location and historical battles make it a symbol of conflict and divine intervention.<p><b>each with their surrounding settlements</b><br>The mention of surrounding settlements indicates the extent of Manasseh's territory and the importance of these cities as administrative and economic centers. These settlements provided support and resources for the main cities, contributing to the overall stability and prosperity of the region. The allocation of these areas to Manasseh reflects the tribe's role in the broader narrative of Israel's settlement in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Manasseh.

It was a "noble city" in the days of Eusebius and Jerome. Many travellers have remarked on its splendid situation, "in this vast area of plain and mountains, in the midst of abundant waters and exuberant fertility" (Robinson, 'Later Bibl. Res.' sec. 7). "Just beyond, and separated by a narrow ridge, is another stream, also perennial, and on the peninsular formed by these two, with a bold, steep brow overlooking the Ghor, stood the citadel of ancient Beth-shean - a sort of Gibraltar on a small scale - of remarkable natural strength, and inaccessible to horsemen. No wonder that it was long ere Israel could wrest it from the Canaanites. The eastern face rises like a steep cone, most incorrectly stated by Robinson to be 'black, and apparently volcanic;' and by Porter, 'probably a crater.' Certainly there are many blocks of basalt lying about, but the hill is simply a limestone bluff." (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 501). He goes on, "How clearly the details of the sad end of Saul were recalled as we stood on this spot" (the summit of the cone). "There was the slope of Gilboa, on which his army was encamped before the battle. Round that hill he slunk by night, conscience stricken, to visit the witch of Endor. Hither, as being a Canaanitish fortress, the Philistines most naturally brought the trophies of the royal slain, and hung them up just by this wall. By the Yasir, and across that plain below us, the gallant men of Jabesh-Gilead hurried on their long night's march to stop the indignity offered to Israel, and to take down the bodies of their king and his sons." Jabesh-Gilead was not far off, and though in full view of the mountain, yet the men of Jabesh could creep along the Ghor by night and climb the steep face of the rock unsuspected by the warriors above; while the roar of the brook would drown all the sounds they might make (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' p. 454). <span class="cmt_word">And her towns.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">daughters</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> LXX.; <span class="accented">viculi</span>, Vulgate. Canon Tristram remarks how each hill in some parts of Palestine is crowned by a village, a number of which still cluster, as of old, round the chief city of the district. So in Italy we may see how times of unsettlement led to a similar policy. The fear of the northern pirates led to the planting the mediaeval towns on hills, and the disturbed state of the country kept them there till a comparatively late period. But many of them are deserted in this more peaceful age. Ibleam. Only known as near the place where Jehu gave Ahaziah his death blow. It was near Megiddo (see <a href="/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>). Dor (see above <a href="/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). Keil thinks that Dor and all the cities after it are in the accusative to "could not drive out" in the next verse. But it is more probable that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> was an anacolouthon. Vandevelde ('Travels,' 1:333) says that he did not wonder that the fainthearted Manassites shrank from attacking Dor when he saw its formidable position, ruder. This, the abode of the famous witch, still bears the old name. It is four miles south of Mount Tabor, in a country honeycombed with caves, and it stands on the shoulder of Little Hermon. The word signifies the "fount of Dor," or "the dwelling." Taanach. For this and Megiddo see <a href="/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>. Three countries. Rather, three <span class="accented">hills</span>, or elevated spots (Napheth, see note, ch. 11:2). Gesenius compares the name Temont. The reference is to Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. Keil suggests <span class="accented">province</span>, but he does not explain how a derivative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> can have this latter signification (cf. <a href="/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>. Beautiful for its height (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>) is Mount Zion). The LXX. and Vulgate regard it as a proper name, and translate, "the third part of Nopheth."
