This location is significant as it marks the southern border of the land allocated to the tribe of Reuben. The Arnon Valley itself is a deep gorge that provided a formidable natural defense. Historically, this area was a strategic military location due to its topography. The mention of Aroer highlights the importance of geographical boundaries in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>along with the city in the middle of the valley</b><br>The city in the middle of the valley likely refers to a settlement that was strategically positioned for trade and defense. This city would have been crucial for controlling access through the valley, which was a key route for travelers and merchants. The presence of a city here indicates the importance of urban centers in ancient Israelite society, serving as hubs of administration, commerce, and military activity. This phrase underscores the significance of cities in the biblical narrative, often representing centers of power and influence.<p><b>to the whole plateau beyond Medeba</b><br>The plateau beyond Medeba refers to the elevated region east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land and strategic importance. Medeba itself was an ancient Moabite city, later occupied by the Israelites. This area was part of the territory given to the tribe of Reuben, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land. The plateau's mention highlights the agricultural potential of the region, which was essential for sustaining the Israelite tribes.

In other words, God had given His people a clearly defined edge to their inheritance.<p>- The Arnon Valley itself had been the historic dividing line between Moab and the Amorites (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>); by naming it again, the text affirms that Israel now holds what once belonged to foreign powers&#8212;just as the LORD promised (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The city in the middle of the valley</b><p>- Not content to leave the border vague, the verse pinpoints &#8220;the city in the middle.&#8221; Most likely this is the fortified outpost that controlled the Arnon crossing (compare <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>).<p>- The wording assures Reuben that even the strategic heart of the gorge is under their stewardship. God&#8217;s gifts to His people are thorough; nothing essential is left in enemy hands (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>).<p>- By highlighting a city rather than just territory, Scripture reminds us that God cares about communities and everyday life, not merely empty landscapes (see <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34-36</a>, where Reubenite towns are named).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The whole plateau beyond Medeba</b><p>- Moving northward, the boundary stretches over &#8220;the whole plateau&#8221; (Hebrew mishor, a high, flat tableland) above the valley, reaching past the prominent town of Medeba (cf. <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> for its later Moabite association).<p>- Earlier, this plateau had been ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites, whose defeat is listed in <a href="/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2-5</a>. Mentioning the &#8220;whole&#8221; plateau underscores total conquest&#8212;there are no pockets of resistance left.<p>- For the Reubenites, this fertile tableland meant grazing for flocks (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>). God matches inheritance to need; the shepherd tribe receives pasture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a> details the southern portion of Reuben&#8217;s inheritance, running from the dramatic rim of the Arnon gorge at Aroer, through its central stronghold, and out across the entire high plateau northward to Medeba. Each phrase reinforces that God fulfilled His promise by giving Israel clearly marked, fully secured territory&#8212;land that meets their practical needs and stands as a testimony to His faithfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The territory</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
