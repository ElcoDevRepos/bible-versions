This allocation was part of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land for his descendants. The act of giving land was significant as it represented the tangible fulfillment of God's covenant and the establishment of the tribes in their inheritance.<p><b>to the clans</b><br>The term "clans" refers to the subdivisions within the tribe of Gad. Each tribe was divided into family groups or clans, which were further divided into households. This distribution ensured that each family unit received a portion of the land, promoting fairness and order within the tribe. It reflects the importance of family and community in Israelite society.<p><b>of the tribe of Gad</b><br>The tribe of Gad was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant. The tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan River, in a region known for its fertile land suitable for livestock, which was fitting given Gad's reputation as a tribe of warriors and herdsmen. This location also placed them as a buffer against eastern invaders, highlighting their role in the defense of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who led them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
