God&#8217;s covenant embraces anyone who aligns with His people in faith and obedience (<a href="/exodus/12-49.htm">Exodus 12:49</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; By listing elders, officers, and judges, Scripture shows that civil leadership must submit to God&#8217;s law alongside everyone else (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene underlines unity: one nation under one covenant, gathered to listen and respond to God together (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried it.</b><p>&#8226; The ark, signifying God&#8217;s presence and the tablets of the Law inside it, is physically central (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3-17</a>). The people&#8217;s posture&#8212;facing the ark&#8212;visually places the Lord at the heart of national life.<p>&#8226; The Levitical priests, set apart to bear the ark (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), mediate the moment. Their role reminds Israel that access to God is on His terms, through appointed servants and, ultimately, through the coming High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Positioning themselves &#8220;on both sides&#8221; expresses reverence and order (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Corporate worship is not haphazard; it follows God-given patterns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim</b><p>&#8226; Mount Gerizim, the mountain of blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a>; 27:12), faces Ebal across a natural amphitheater near Shechem. The geography amplifies the spoken word so the entire assembly can hear.<p>&#8226; Standing before Gerizim to hear blessings dramatizes the tangible choice of obedience that yields life and prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows the fuller blessing in Christ, who &#8220;redeemed us from the curse of the Law&#8221; that we might receive &#8220;the blessing of Abraham&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded earlier, to bless the people of Israel.</b><p>&#8226; Mount Ebal is the designated site for pronouncing curses (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-13.htm">Deuteronomy 27:13</a>). By including both mountains, Joshua reaffirms that God&#8217;s covenant offers blessing for obedience and warning for rebellion.<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s strict obedience to &#8220;what Moses&#8230;had commanded&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-8</a>) demonstrates continuity: God&#8217;s Word does not change with leadership transitions.<p>&#8226; Although curses are announced from Ebal, the verse highlights blessing, showing God&#8217;s heart to bless His people when they walk in His ways (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The event follows the defeat of Ai; before pushing farther into Canaan, Israel pauses to anchor the conquest in covenant faithfulness.

The arrangement fulfills Moses&#8217; commands, placing God&#8217;s presence at the center, and dramatizes the choice between blessing and curse. In renewing their commitment, Israel affirms that national success depends on wholehearted obedience to the unchanging Word of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all Israel</span> (see <a href="/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 2</a>). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> is used very loosely in Hebrew (see <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). We need not, therefore, assume as a matter of course that the whole people, men, women, and children, were taken up to Shechem to behold this ceremony. It is quite possible that during all Joshua's marches and campaigns a large number of the people remained under guard at Gilgal (see <a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>), which remained the headquarters of the Israelites until the country was subdued. All that is here meant is that a very great number of the people were gathered together, and that every tribe, every age, and each sex were largely represented at this important ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">And officers.</span> Shoterim (see <a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Half of them.</span> Origen's explanation of the spiritual meaning of this passage is noteworthy, even though somewhat farfetched. He regards those of the tribes who stood on Mount Gerizim to bless, as the type of those who are led, not by fear of God's threatenings, but by a longing for God's promises and blessings; those who stood on Mount Ebal to curse, as the type of those who are driven by the fear of punishment to obey the will of God, and these finally attain salvation. The former, he adds, are the more noble of the two; but Jesus, who reads the hearts, gives each their proper station, and places some on Mount Ebal to curse, not that they themselves may receive the curse, but, by regarding the curse pronounced on sinners, may learn thereby how to escape it. <span class="cmt_word">Over against.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> rather, "in the direction off" The command in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> is that they shall stand upon the two mountains. No doubt certain representatives of the tribes stood on the mountain, and the rest of the people at the foot of the mountain, on either side of the valley, "crowding the slopes," as Canon Tristram says. The valley is narrow here, and the voice in mountainous regions, where the air is rarer, carries far. Under special circumstances, such as frosty weather, the voices of men crying their wares have been distinctly heard across the Humber in our own country. And in mountain passes, as any one who has travelled in them may easily ascertain, conversations may be carried on from opposite sides of a valley or ravine without the slightest difficulty. In this particular place Canon Tristram tell us ('Land of Israel,' pp. 149, 150) that when on Mount Gerizim he heard every word uttered by a man who was then driving his ass down Mount Ebal, and that afterwards two of his party recited the commandments antiphonally from the two sides of the valley without the least difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/8-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
