The use of rams' horns, or shofars, is deeply rooted in Israelite tradition, often used to signal important events or divine intervention (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>). The priests, as mediators between God and the people, signify the sacred nature of this procession.<p><b>kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant represents God's presence among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). The priests marching ahead of the Ark symbolize the preparation and sanctification required before approaching God. This procession mirrors the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, where the Ark led the way (<a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>).<p><b>and blowing the horns</b><br>The continuous blowing of the horns serves as a call to attention and a proclamation of God's impending action. It echoes the trumpet blasts at Mount Sinai, which announced God's presence and covenant (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). This act also prefigures the eschatological trumpet calls in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6</a>).<p><b>The armed troops went in front of them</b><br>The presence of armed troops highlights the military aspect of the conquest of Jericho. This formation underscores the combination of divine intervention and human obedience in achieving victory. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a warrior leading His people (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>).<p><b>and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD</b><br>The rear guard ensures the protection and completeness of the procession, emphasizing the order and discipline required in following God's commands. This mirrors the structure of Israel's camp in the wilderness, where the tribes were arranged around the Ark (Numbers 2).<p><b>while the horns kept sounding</b><br>The continuous sounding of the horns reinforces the urgency and seriousness of the moment. It serves as a reminder of God's power and the need for faith and obedience.

<a href="/2_chronicles/20-21.htm">2 Chronicles 20:21-22</a>).<p>- Rams&#8217; horns (shofars) were used to announce God&#8217;s action&#8212;calling the people together (<a href="/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8-10</a>) and signaling divine intervention (<a href="/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>).<p>- The pairing of &#8220;seven&#8221;

Priests, trumpets, and the Ark take center stage, framing the conquest of Jericho as a divine act rather than a human exploit. The marching order&#8212;priests with shofars, Ark, troops front and rear&#8212;keeps Israel&#8217;s focus on God&#8217;s presence. Continuous trumpet blasts proclaim both judgment on the city and faith in the LORD&#8217;s promise.
