The context is the battle against Ai, following the initial defeat due to Achan's sin (Joshua 7). Joshua's leadership is crucial, as he follows God's renewed instructions for victory. The phrase "advance on the city" suggests a direct approach, which is part of a larger ambush strategy. This reflects the importance of obedience to divine guidance in achieving success. The city of Ai, located near Bethel, was a significant Canaanite stronghold, and its capture was vital for Israel's conquest of the Promised Land.<p><b>When they come out against us as they did the first time,</b><br>This refers to the previous encounter with Ai, where the Israelites were defeated (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>). The phrase highlights the expectation of a similar response from the men of Ai, who would be confident after their initial victory. This expectation is crucial for the success of Joshua's ambush plan. The historical context shows that ancient warfare often involved psychological tactics, and the Israelites' previous defeat would have emboldened Ai's defenders. This also demonstrates the cyclical nature of Israel's battles, where past failures are used to set up future victories.<p><b>we will flee from them.</b><br>The tactic of feigned retreat is a classic military strategy used to draw the enemy out of a fortified position. By pretending to flee, Joshua and his troops aim to lure the men of Ai away from the city, leaving it vulnerable to the ambush set by the rest of the Israelite forces. This strategy requires precise timing and coordination, reflecting Joshua's leadership and the discipline of his troops. Theologically, this can be seen as a test of faith and obedience, as the Israelites must trust in God's plan despite the appearance of retreat. This tactic also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people, where apparent defeat is turned into triumph, a theme seen throughout Scripture and fulfilled in the victory of Christ over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, chosen by God to succeed Moses and lead the Israelites into the Promised Land.
