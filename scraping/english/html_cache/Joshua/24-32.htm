This act symbolizes the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises and the Israelites' respect for their patriarchs. It also serves as a reminder of the Israelites' journey from slavery to the Promised Land, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>were buried at Shechem</b><br>Shechem holds significant historical and spiritual importance. It is the location where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Jacob settled after returning from Paddan Aram (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18-20</a>). The burial of Joseph's bones here signifies the fulfillment of God's promises and the establishment of Israel in the land. Shechem later becomes a city of refuge and a Levitical city, further underscoring its spiritual significance.<p><b>in the plot of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem&#8217;s father</b><br>This purchase is recorded in <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>, where Jacob buys the land for a hundred pieces of silver. The transaction signifies a legitimate claim to the land, contrasting with the later conquest narratives. It also reflects the patriarchs' faith in God's promise to give them the land, as they invested in it even before its full possession.<p><b>for a hundred pieces of silver</b><br>The mention of the purchase price underscores the legal and binding nature of the transaction. It reflects the customs of the time, where land ownership was often secured through purchase. This detail also highlights the continuity of God's promise, as the land bought by Jacob becomes the resting place for Joseph, linking the patriarchs' faith with the fulfillment of God's covenant.<p><b>So it became an inheritance for Joseph&#8217;s descendants</b><br>This phrase indicates the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the descendants of the patriarchs. Joseph's burial in Shechem symbolizes the inheritance of the land by his descendants, the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. It serves as a tangible reminder of God's faithfulness and the realization of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The inheritance also prefigures the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ, as mentioned in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, whose bones were carried from Egypt to Canaan as a fulfillment of his dying wish.

This passage is another link in the chain of evidence which serves to establish the authenticity and early date of the present hook. For though Joseph's name was always a striking one in Israelitish history, it is unquestionable that as time went on his fame was overshadowed by that of his ancestors. It is Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob on whom the national mind was fixed. It is their names that the prophets recall, the covenant with them which is constantly brought to mind. But during the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt, and while the departure from Egypt was yet recent, the conspicuous position which Joseph occupied in Egyptian history could not fail to be remembered, and the command he gave concerning his bones, as well as his conviction that the prophecy concerning their departure would be fulfilled, was not likely to be forgotten. The emphatic way in which the fulfilment of Joseph's charge is here recorded affords a presumption for the early date of the book, as well as against the theory that it was a late compilation from early records. We are not necessarily to suppose that the interment of Joseph's remains took place at this period. The Hebrew, as we have seen, has no pluperfect tense (see for this <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>), and therefore it may have taken place, and most probably did take place, as soon as Shechem was in the hands of Israel. In a parcel of ground. Rather, <span class="accented">in the portion of the field</span> (see <a href="/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). Our word <span class="accented">parcel</span> is derived from <span class="accented">particula, and was</span> originally identical with the word <span class="accented">particle</span>, a little part. So Chaucer speaks of <span class="accented">parcel-</span>mele, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by parts. Shakespere has a "parcel-gilt goblet," that is, a goblet partly gilt. It has now come to have a widely different meaning. Pieces of silver. There can be little doubt that this is the true translation. The cognate word in Arabic, signifying "justice," is apparently derived from the idea of even scales. A kindred Hebrew word signifies "truth," probably from the same original idea. Another kindred Arabic word signifies a balance. It therefore, no doubt, means a coin of a certain weight, just as the word <span class="accented">shekel</span> has the original signification of weight. The Rabbinical notion, that the word signified "Iambs," rests upon no solid foundation, though supported by all the ancient versions. Some commentators, however, think that a coin is meant upon which the figure of a lamb was impressed. So Vatablus and Drusius. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> Vulgate "centum novellis ovibus." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Also,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
