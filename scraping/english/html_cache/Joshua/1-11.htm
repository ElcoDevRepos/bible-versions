The camp represents the entire community of Israel, which had been organized into tribes and families. The act of going through the camp emphasizes the importance of communication and unity among the people. It reflects the leadership structure established by Moses, now continued by Joshua, ensuring that everyone is informed and ready for the task ahead.<p><b>Prepare your provisions</b><br>This phrase indicates the need for practical preparation before undertaking the crossing of the Jordan River. It suggests a period of self-sufficiency, as the Israelites would soon leave the manna-dependent life of the wilderness. The preparation of provisions also symbolizes spiritual readiness, as the people must be prepared both physically and spiritually to enter the Promised Land. This mirrors the Christian call to be prepared for spiritual battles, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.<p><b>for within three days you will cross the Jordan</b><br>The mention of "three days" is significant, often symbolizing a period of preparation or transition in the Bible. This timeframe allows the Israelites to ready themselves for a major change. The Jordan River represents a boundary between the wilderness and the Promised Land, a physical and spiritual barrier that must be crossed. The crossing of the Jordan is a type of baptism, symbolizing death to the old life and entry into a new life, paralleling the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<p><b>to go in and take possession of the land</b><br>This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan. The act of taking possession implies both divine promise and human responsibility. The Israelites are called to act in faith, trusting in God's promise while also engaging in the necessary actions to claim it. This reflects the Christian life, where believers are called to live out their faith actively, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>.<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving you to possess</b><br>This emphasizes the divine origin of the promise. The land is a gift from God, highlighting His sovereignty and faithfulness. The phrase "the LORD your God" reinforces the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding them of their identity as His chosen people. The concept of possession is not merely physical but also spiritual, as the land represents a place of rest and blessing under God's rule.

Leadership in God&#8217;s work is proactive, just as Moses sent leaders through Israel in <a href="/numbers/31-3.htm">Numbers 31:3</a> and as Jesus later sent disciples two by two in <a href="/luke/9-2.htm">Luke 9:2</a>. The camp itself is holy ground where God&#8217;s presence resides (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>), so marching through it underscores that every household must be reached, not just the eager few.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell the people</b><p>God&#8217;s orders come by word of mouth, reinforcing community accountability. As <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> commands, truth is shared &#8220;when you sit at home and when you walk along the road.&#8221; By instructing each family, Joshua ensures no one can claim ignorance when the moment of faith arrives (cf. <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prepare your provisions</b><p>Physical readiness mirrors spiritual readiness. Israel would need food gathered ahead of time because manna would cease once they entered Canaan (<a href="/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>). Similar preparation is seen in <a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>, where the Passover meal was eaten with sandals on and staff in hand. God provides, yet His people still plan responsibly (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Within three days</b><p>A precise timetable boosts faith and urgency. Three days later the priests step into the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2-3, 14</a>). The phrase recalls God&#8217;s pattern of decisive action after a short, defined wait&#8212;Abraham&#8217;s journey to Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>) and Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). Waiting on God is never indefinite; His promises have set appointments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will cross the Jordan</b><p>Crossing the Jordan is the hinge between promise and possession. The river was at flood stage (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), humanly impassable, highlighting that victory depends on the Lord&#8217;s power, much like the Red Sea crossing (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). <a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a> shows that God still leads His people through barriers into new life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To go in and take possession of the land</b><p>Faith must act. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a> repeats, &#8220;Go in and possess the land.&#8221; God&#8217;s gifts are not passive entitlements; they require courageous obedience (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Israel&#8217;s swords will be drawn, yet success hinges on trust, not muscle (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD your God is giving you to possess</b><p>The land is both gift and inheritance. <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a> first promised it; now the transfer is imminent. &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Because the Lord gives, the outcome is certain (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>). Israel&#8217;s task is to receive with gratitude and fidelity (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a> calls God&#8217;s people to immediate, practical obedience: circulate the command, ready supplies, trust the timetable, and step into the impossible because the Lord Himself guarantees the inheritance. The verse marries divine promise with human responsibility, urging believers today to prepare, move, and possess every blessing God has already declared theirs in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Prepare you victuals.</span>--The question may be asked, what preparation is intended, since they had the manna, which did not cease until several days after they passed the Jordan. But it does not seem possible to assign any other meaning to the word except that of provision for a journey or for a warlike expedition. Perhaps the order was intended to prepare the Israelites for the transition from the manna to other food. It may be also that the manna which supported them in their pilgrimage through the wilderness was not so fit to sustain them in the warfare which they were about to begin. For the phrase itself, compare <a href="/exodus/12-39.htm" title="And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.">Exodus 12:39</a> : "They were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither <span class= "ital">had they prepared for themselves any victual." </span>When there was a difficulty in obtaining other provision, God gave His people manna. Now, when they could easily provide food for themselves, He would not support them in idleness; and perhaps this is the common-sense view of the order given in the text. If called to any expedition which would take them far from the camp, the manna would not be within reach of all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare you victuals.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">game</span>, the term being applied to meat obtained by hunting. Thus it is applied by Isaac to Esau's venison in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>. Here it means <span class="accented">food of any kind</span>, but especially animal food. It is therefore obvious that the miraculous supply of manna was soon to cease (cf. <a href="/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Within three days.</span> Much difficulty has been created here by the fact that another three days are mentioned in chap. 3:2 as elapsing after the return of the spies, which has been supposed to have taken place between this command and the period then mentioned. Three more days were spent (<a href="/joshua/2-22.htm">Joshua 2:22</a>) by the spies in eluding the pursuit of the men of Jericho - one day in going thither, and one more in returning to Moses. Consequently eight days, if not more (see <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), must have elapsed between this proclamation and the actual crossing of the Jordan. But when we remember that the Hebrew language possesses no pluperfect tense, that there are many instances, such as (very probably) <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, and more certainly <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18, 32</a>, where the Hebrew narrative has clearly departed from the chronological order, and that the chronology is obscured by this chasm in the Hebrew linguistic system, we may suppose that the narrative in the second chapter is parenthetical, and relates to events which occurred before the occasion now spoken cf. This is the view taken by Josephus and the Rabbis, and our translators have adopted it in the margin - a proceeding which, as their preface shows, may frequently be held to imply that in their opinion it is the preferable interpretation. It is energetically impugned by Keil, who maintains that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of this arrangement. He does not, however, make out a very powerful case against the simple explanation of Cornelius a Lapide, that the spies left the camp on the 3rd Nisan, returned on the 6th, that Joshua gave his order on the 7th, and that on the 10th (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) the crossing was effected. Stripped of all verbiage, Keil's argument appears to amount simply to this, that it was not likely that the account of the narrative would be thus interrupted by an account of a transaction out of its proper chronological order. It may be added that it seems doubtful whether we must not render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in ver. 12, by the pluperfect, for it seems very probable that the word of command to the two tribes and a half who had obtained their inheritance beyond Jordan had been given before this, and that therefore it may have preceded the command given to the spies, in which case one of Keil's chief objections fails to the ground. Other explanations than that of Cornelius a Lapide have been suggested. Thus Kimchi supposes that the spies left on the 5th Nisan and returned on the 8th; while Masius supposes that they were sent out simultaneously with these orders. Augustine's explanation, that Joshua did not speak by revelation, but was influenced by human hope, is noticeable, as proving that the early fathers did not always take the strictest view of inspiration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;
