Joshua, as the leader of Israel, relied on reports from his men to make strategic decisions. This reflects the importance of leadership and the role of divine guidance in decision-making, as seen throughout the book of Joshua. It also highlights the organized structure of the Israelite forces.<p><b>The five kings have been found;</b><br>The five kings refer to the coalition of Amorite kings from Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. These kings had united against Gibeon, which had made peace with Israel. Their discovery signifies a turning point in the battle, as capturing the leaders would demoralize their forces. This event underscores the theme of divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as these kings were part of the land God had promised to give to the Israelites.<p><b>They are hiding in the cave at Makkedah:</b><br>Makkedah is a location in the Shephelah region of ancient Canaan. The use of a cave as a hiding place is significant, as caves were common refuges in the ancient Near East, providing natural protection. The act of hiding suggests fear and desperation, contrasting with the confidence and faith of Joshua and the Israelites. This scene foreshadows the eventual defeat and execution of these kings, symbolizing God's judgment against the enemies of Israel. The cave at Makkedah becomes a place of divine justice, reminiscent of other biblical instances where caves play a role in God's plans, such as David hiding from Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.
