Throughout the Old Testament, God made numerous covenants with His people, such as the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-24). The fulfillment of these promises is evident in Israel's conquest of Canaan, as detailed in the earlier chapters of Joshua. This serves as a reminder of God's reliability and the importance of trusting in His word.<p><b>likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened</b><br>Here, the text underscores the conditional nature of God's promises, which often include blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The "calamity" refers to the consequences of turning away from God, which historically manifested in events like the Babylonian exile. This serves as a warning to remain faithful to God's commandments.<p><b>until He has destroyed you from this good land</b><br>The "good land" refers to the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's provision and blessing. The potential destruction from the land is a direct consequence of Israel's disobedience, as seen in later historical events when the Israelites were exiled. This reflects the seriousness of covenantal faithfulness and the repercussions of failing to uphold it.<p><b>He has given you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the gift of the land as an act of divine grace. The land was not earned by Israel's merit but was a fulfillment of God's promise to their ancestors. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and generosity, and the responsibility of the Israelites to honor God through their stewardship of the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, delivering his farewell address to the Israelites, reminding them of God's faithfulness and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who has fulfilled His promises and warns of the consequences of breaking the covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, recipients of the Promised Land, and the audience of Joshua's address.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, given to the Israelites as an inheritance, contingent upon their obedience to God's commands.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, involving blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_and_justice.htm">God's Faithfulness and Justice</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, both in blessings and in judgments.

Joshua uses this as an argument that the evil also will not fail to follow, if Israel provoke God to inflict it. But the memory of these words, and of the great deeds of Jehovah, faded quickly from their minds. And then, like the people of the earth before the flood, like the men of Sodom before it was destroyed, and like many other people since, they turned a deaf ear to the prophecies of evil which faithful souls foresaw and foretold. The warnings of the prophets are but a variation upon the predictions of Moses in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-14.htm">Deuteronomy 29:14-28</a>, and of Joshua, here addressed to a generation who had brought some of the predicted evil upon themselves, and would not see that by refusing to listen, they would bring upon themselves yet more. How terribly have these predictions been fulfilled! First, the Babylonish captivity; then the disorders and anarchy in a territory which the Jewish people inhabited, but which they were not strong enough to rule; then the siege of and destruction of Jerusalem under Titus with its accompanying horrors. Then the dispersion of the Jews among all the nations, the barbarous and inhuman persecutions they met with in the Middle Ages from priest and monarch alike: the Inquisition in Spain, the contempt and hatred which continued to be felt for them among more enlightened nations, as evidenced in Marlowe's 'Jew of Malta,' and Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice,' in the days of our own Queen Elizabeth. Only in our own age has a brighter day begun to dawn on them, and three thousand years of oppression, relieved only by the brief glories of David and his dynasty, are beginning to be compensated by a share in the world's rewards and honours. <span class="cmt_word">All evil things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the evil word</span>;
