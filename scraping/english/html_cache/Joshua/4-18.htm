It symbolized God's presence and covenant with Israel. The priests carrying the Ark signifies the leadership and spiritual guidance of the Levites, who were set apart for holy duties. The Ark's presence in the crossing of the Jordan River underscores the divine intervention and guidance in Israel's journey to the Promised Land, reminiscent of the crossing of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>.<p><b>came up out of the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River was a significant geographical and spiritual boundary for the Israelites. Crossing it marked the transition from the wilderness wanderings to entering the Promised Land. This event is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The act of coming up out of the Jordan symbolizes a new beginning and the faithfulness of God in leading His people.<p><b>and their feet touched the dry land</b><br>The dry land signifies the miraculous nature of the crossing. Just as God parted the Red Sea, He also stopped the flow of the Jordan River, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. This miracle reinforced God's power and presence with His people. The dry land also represents the fulfillment of God's promise and the tangible evidence of His provision and protection.<p><b>the waters of the Jordan returned to their course</b><br>The return of the waters to their natural course after the priests and the Ark had crossed signifies the completion of the miracle. It demonstrates God's control over nature and His ability to suspend natural laws for His purposes. This event would have served as a powerful reminder to the Israelites of God's sovereignty and might.<p><b>and overflowed all the banks as before</b><br>The overflowing of the banks indicates the natural state of the Jordan River during the harvest season, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>. This detail highlights the miraculous nature of the crossing, as the river was at its fullest and most formidable. The return to normalcy after the crossing serves as a testament to the extraordinary intervention of God, reinforcing the idea that the Israelites' success in entering the Promised Land was due to divine assistance rather than human effort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The spiritual leaders of Israel who carried the Ark of the Covenant.
