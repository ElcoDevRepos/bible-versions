Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was a physical mark that set the Israelites apart as God's chosen people. The practice was a requirement for participation in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>).

The new generation born during this period had not received the sign of the covenant, highlighting a break in the continuity of the covenantal practice. This situation necessitated a renewal of the covenant as they prepared to enter the Promised Land, symbolizing a fresh start and recommitment to God's commands.

God had first instituted circumcision with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10&#8211;14</a>), and Moses made it a prerequisite for participating in the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>). That first generation obeyed, so Joshua can say, &#8220;all the people who came out of Egypt had been circumcised&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a>a).<p>&#8226; They witnessed the plagues, crossed the Red Sea, and entered covenant at Sinai&#8212;each moment underlining that they belonged to the Lord.<p>&#8226; Their obedience highlights how God&#8217;s commands are never negotiable, even in turbulent times (cf. <a href="/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>None of those born in the wilderness</b><p>A new reality arose during the forty-year trek described in <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29&#8211;33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>. Children were growing up under desert skies rather than in Egypt&#8217;s brick pits. Yet the ordinary routines that should have formed them in faith&#8212;such as circumcision on the eighth day&#8212;were neglected.<p>&#8226; Their parents buried the older, unbelieving generation (<a href="/numbers/26-64.htm">Numbers 26:64-65</a>) but failed to transmit a key covenant marker to their sons.<p>&#8226; The book of Hebrews later warns believers not to copy that generation&#8217;s unbelief (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>), reminding us that lapses in obedience are contagious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the journey from Egypt had been circumcised</b><p>The phrase stresses how the wilderness became a long &#8220;journey&#8221; rather than the brief passage God originally intended (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>). Lack of circumcision symbolized the deeper issue: hearts had not been fully yielded. Now, on the plains of Jericho, God tells Joshua, &#8220;Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel again&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Timing matters. Before a single city falls, the nation must renew covenant loyalty.<p>&#8226; This act readies them for the first Passover in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>) and demonstrates that victory flows from obedience, not military might (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a> divides Israel into two groups: the obedient, circumcised fathers who left Egypt, and the uncircumcised sons born during the wilderness wanderings. The verse underscores how easily a community can drift from clear commands when daily life feels unsettled. By calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness before they confront Canaan, God reinforces a timeless truth: obedience is the gateway to blessing, and every generation must personally embrace the signs of belonging to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now all the people that came out were circumcised.</span> The Hebrew of this passage (which runs literally thus - "Now circumcised had they been, all the people who were going forth") is sufficient to refute the idea that there was a great circumcision of the people under Moses, on account of the neglect of the rite in Egypt. For, before the exodus, Moses was not in a position to perform any general act of this kind, as the history plainly shows, while after it such a rite could not have taken place, since the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> denotes a state of things which was completed at the time spoken of, and therefore must here be rendered (as above) by the pluperfect. <span class="cmt_word">Them they had not circumcised.</span> Here again the Hebrew is used of the perfected action, and is therefore rightly rendered by our version, giving the idea that the Israelites who were born in the wilderness had not been circumcised up to the point which our history has now reached.
