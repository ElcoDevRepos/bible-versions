They had assisted the other tribes in conquering the Promised Land west of the Jordan River. The "great wealth" refers to the spoils of war, a common practice in ancient times where victors would take possessions from the defeated. This wealth is a tangible sign of God's blessing and fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<p><b>with immense herds of livestock,</b><br>Livestock was a primary measure of wealth and prosperity in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The mention of "immense herds" underscores the abundance that God provided. It also reflects the pastoral lifestyle of these tribes, who chose land east of the Jordan River because it was suitable for grazing.<p><b>with silver, gold, bronze, iron,</b><br>These metals were valuable commodities in the ancient world, used for trade, crafting tools, weapons, and ornaments. Their inclusion in the spoils indicates the comprehensive nature of the victory and the economic prosperity it brought. Silver and gold often symbolize purity and divinity in biblical literature, while bronze and iron represent strength and durability.<p><b>and very many clothes.</b><br>Clothing was a significant part of wealth in ancient times, often indicating status and identity. The mention of "very many clothes" suggests not only material wealth but also the cultural exchange that occurred through conquest. Garments could be used for personal use or traded, adding to the tribes' resources.<p><b>Divide with your brothers the spoil of your enemies.&#8221;</b><br>This directive emphasizes the importance of unity and shared blessing among the tribes of Israel. It reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where the success of one part was to benefit the whole. This principle of sharing is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to share with those in need (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). The "spoil of your enemies" signifies God's deliverance and provision, a recurring theme throughout the conquest narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, who led the people into the Promised Land.

Now Joshua blesses them: &#8220;Return to your homes&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-6.htm">Joshua 22:6-7</a>). The word underscores completion and rest, echoing Moses&#8217; earlier charge: &#8220;When the LORD gives rest&#8230; then each of you may return to the land of your possession&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness in bringing them safely back validates every previous promise (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with your great wealth</b><p>Obedience has been rewarded tangibly. The Law had foreseen that God &#8220;gives you power to gain wealth&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>). Centuries later, Paul will remind believers that God &#8220;richly provides us with everything&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The riches here are not ill-gotten; they are the ordained fruit of covenant faithfulness in battle (<a href="/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>).<p>Key idea: God delights to bless those who put kingdom commitments ahead of personal comfort (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with immense herds of livestock</b><p>These tribes were shepherd-people from the start (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>). Their large flocks had motivated the request to settle east of the Jordan. God does not rebuke their pastoral identity; instead, He enlarges it. Like Job, who ended with &#8220;twice as much as he had before&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>), they experience abundance that showcases divine generosity.<p>Bullet points of meaning:<p>&#8226; Livestock signified ongoing provision&#8212;milk, meat, wool.<p>&#8226; Herds required stewardship, reminding them to manage blessing wisely (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The physical evidence of God&#8217;s favor would testify to future generations (<a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with silver, gold, bronze, iron</b><p>Metals denote both value and durability. Earlier campaigns had yielded &#8220;silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron&#8221; set apart for the Lord (<a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>). Now, what remained legitimately belonged to the soldiers&#8212;yet still ultimately from God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8</a>). The listing of metals in descending value teaches gratitude for every level of provision (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>Application snapshot:<p>&#8226; Silver and gold&#8212;portable wealth for family security (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Bronze and iron&#8212;tools and weapons for future work and defense (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and very many clothes</b><p>Clothing was costly in the ancient Near East; plundered garments symbolized honor and renewal (<a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>). God had earlier clothed Israel in the wilderness so that &#8220;your clothes did not wear out&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>). Now He adds variety and abundance. As <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a> will later picture, raiment can hint at righteousness awarded by grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Divide with your brothers the spoil of your enemies</b><p>Joshua commands equitable sharing: &#8220;Divide with your brothers&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>). This echoes <a href="/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a>, where warriors and those who stayed with the camp split the plunder equally. David will reaffirm the principle after Ziklag: &#8220;The share of the one who stays&#8230; shall be the same as the share of the one who goes to battle&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24-25</a>). Such distribution:<p>&#8226; Prevents jealousy (<a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Upholds unity among the tribes (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Mirrors the gospel ethic that every believer benefits from Christ&#8217;s victory, though only He fought sin and death (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a> celebrates God&#8217;s faithfulness from conquest to homecoming. The returning soldiers are blessed with rest, riches, herds, precious metals, and garments&#8212;tokens of divine provision. Yet the final command to share reminds us that blessing is never hoarded; it is distributed in love, preserving unity and magnifying the generosity of God who gives all good things.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Riches</span>.
