The decision to send only about three thousand men suggests a level of overconfidence, possibly due to the previous victory at Jericho. The number reflects a strategic choice based on the spies' report in <a href="/joshua/7-3.htm">Joshua 7:3</a>, which underestimated the strength of Ai. This decision contrasts with the larger forces typically used in ancient warfare, highlighting a reliance on human judgment rather than seeking divine guidance.<p><b>but they fled before the men of Ai</b><br>The Israelites' retreat marks a significant and unexpected defeat, especially after the miraculous victory at Jericho. This phrase underscores the consequences of disobedience and sin within the camp, as Achan's transgression (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>) led to the loss of divine favor. The flight before Ai's men serves as a humbling reminder of the need for reliance on God rather than human strength. This event foreshadows the importance of holiness and obedience in achieving victory, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament. The defeat also prefigures the necessity of repentance and atonement, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who provides victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.
