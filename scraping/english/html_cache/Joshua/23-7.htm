Despite their victories, some Canaanite nations remained. The command not to associate with these nations is rooted in the concern for spiritual purity and the danger of adopting pagan practices. Historically, the Canaanites were known for idolatry and practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This directive is consistent with earlier commands in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2-4</a>, emphasizing the need to avoid intermarriage and cultural assimilation that could lead to idolatry.<p><b>You must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them,</b><br>Invoking the names of foreign gods was more than a verbal act; it signified allegiance and acknowledgment of their power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, names held significant power and calling upon a deity's name was an act of worship and submission. This prohibition is a safeguard against syncretism, ensuring that the Israelites' worship remains exclusive to Yahweh. The command echoes the first two commandments in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-7</a>, which prohibit having other gods and misusing God's name.<p><b>and you must not serve them or bow down to them.</b><br>Service and bowing down are acts of worship and submission. In the ancient world, these actions were often part of religious rituals and ceremonies. The Israelites are warned against participating in such practices, which would signify a rejection of their covenant with Yahweh. This command is a reminder of the exclusive worship required by the covenant, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-15</a>. The call to avoid idolatry is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the constant temptation Israel faced and the need for vigilance in maintaining their distinct identity as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites, urging them to remain faithful to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have settled in the Promised Land but are surrounded by pagan nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations with whom the Israelites are warned not to associate, as they worship false gods.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pagan_gods.htm">Pagan Gods</a></b><br>The false deities worshiped by the Canaanite nations, which the Israelites are warned against.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>The Israelites are reminded to remain faithful to God alone, avoiding any form of idolatry or syncretism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/separation_from_worldly_influences.htm">Separation from Worldly Influences</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to avoid pagan practices, Christians today are called to be in the world but not of it, maintaining spiritual purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_names.htm">The Power of Names</a></b><br>Invoking the names of other gods signifies allegiance; Christians are to call upon the name of the Lord alone.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_loyalty.htm">Covenant Loyalty</a></b><br>The Israelites' relationship with God was based on a covenant that required exclusive worship, a principle that applies to the New Covenant in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_compromise.htm">Guarding Against Compromise</a></b><br>The warning against serving or bowing to other gods serves as a reminder to guard against compromising one's faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_23_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 23:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_ties_with_these_nations_daily.htm">How can we avoid "associating with these nations" in our daily lives today?

It must always be remembered that, in proposing the extermination of the seven nations, Jehovah reserved to Himself the ordering of the details of the conquest and extermination.
