Asher's name means "happy" or "blessed," reflecting the blessing Jacob gave him in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, which speaks of Asher's rich food and royal delicacies. The inheritance of Asher was part of the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God to Moses and executed by Joshua. Asher's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, along the Mediterranean coast, which was known for its fertile land and olive oil production, fulfilling Moses' blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24-25</a>. The division of the land was done by casting lots, a method believed to reflect God's sovereign will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p><b>including these cities and their villages</b><br>The specific cities and villages within Asher's inheritance are detailed earlier in <a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24-30</a>. This region included important cities such as Acco (later known as Ptolemais) and Tyre, although the tribe struggled to fully possess these areas due to the presence of the Canaanites, as noted in <a href="/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31-32</a>. The mention of cities and villages highlights the structured settlement and the importance of urban centers in ancient Israelite society. These locations were significant for trade and cultural exchange, given their proximity to the sea and neighboring nations. The inability to fully drive out the Canaanites from these cities also reflects the ongoing struggle and partial disobedience of the Israelites, which had long-term implications for their history and relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asher.htm">Asher</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Asher, the eighth son of Jacob and Zilpah.

The same theme echoes spiritually in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, where believers are told, &#8220;In Him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything.&#8221; The verse in Joshua grounds that larger truth: the Lord&#8217;s people live on what He assigns, confident that His gifts are good and secure (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the clans</b><p>The words &#8220;of the clans&#8221; stress that every family line within Asher counted. <a href="/numbers/26-56.htm">Numbers 26:56</a> clarifies that the lot fell &#8220;to the larger and the smaller alike,&#8221; preventing any single household from monopolizing God&#8217;s blessing. By listing clans elsewhere (e.g., <a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>), Scripture underscores how the covenant reaches into ordinary homes. It is a gentle reminder that God&#8217;s plans are never merely institutional; they are personal, touching grandparents, parents, and children who each needed a specific portion to cultivate and steward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the tribe of Asher</b><p>&#8220;Asher&#8221; had long-standing promises over it. Jacob foresaw in <a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>, &#8220;Asher&#8217;s food will be rich, and he will provide delicacies fit for a king,&#8221; while Moses blessed the tribe in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24</a>, &#8220;Most blessed of sons is Asher; may he be favored by his brothers and dip his foot in oil.&#8221; <a href="/bsb/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a> shows those words moving from prophecy to geography: fertile coastal and hill country, olive groves, and access to trade routes. The fulfillment here assures us that God&#8217;s earlier words never expire. What He foretells in one generation He performs in another (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including these cities</b><p><a href="/joshua/19-25.htm">Joshua 19:25-30</a> lists sixteen cities by name&#8212;Acco, Rehob, Aphek, and others&#8212;before summarizing in verse 31. Recording each town may feel routine, yet it signals precision. God knew every border stone, market square, and household He was handing over, much like Jesus later says, &#8220;Even the hairs of your head are all numbered&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>). It also shows that faith is lived in real neighborhoods: fields to plow, gates to maintain, neighbors to serve.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their villages</b><p>The phrase &#8220;and their villages&#8221; gathers the hamlets, farmsteads, and satellite communities orbiting the larger towns. Similar language appears in <a href="/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45 and 17</a>:11, highlighting that God&#8217;s concern stretches beyond population centers to the smallest settlement. Rural families, shepherds, and craftsmen enjoyed the same covenant security as merchants in the city walls. For us, that breadth teaches that no place is too out-of-the-way for the Lord&#8217;s attention, nor any believer too obscure for His inheritance (<a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/19-31.htm">Joshua 19:31</a> seals Asher&#8217;s allotment with a single sentence that overflows with meaning. It affirms God&#8217;s exact faithfulness&#8212;every clan, every city, every village receives what was promised. The verse invites today&#8217;s reader to rest in the same certainty: the Lord still assigns good portions, fulfills old promises, and cares for the well-known and the hidden alike.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the inheritance of the tribe of Asher.</span> Asher appears to have been allotted a long but narrow strip of territory between Naphtali and the sea. The natural advantages of the territory must have been great. Not only was it described prophetically by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>) and by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24, 25</a>), but the prosperity of the two great maritime cities of Tyro and Sidon was due to the immense commercial advantages the neighbourhood afforded. St. Jean d'Acre, within the territory once assigned to Asher, has inherited the prosperity, so far as anything under the Turkish rule can be prosperous, once enjoyed by her two predecessors. Maundrell, the acute English chaplain at Aleppo, who visited Palestine in 1696, describes the plain of Acre in his day as about six hours' journey from north to south, and two from west to east; as being well watered, and possessing "everything else that might render it both pleasant and fruitful. But," he adds, "this delicious plain is now almost desolate, being suffered, for want of culture, to run up to rank weeds, as high as our horses' backs." Asher, however, never employed the advantages its situation offered. They never subdued the Canaanites around them, but, unquestionably at a very early date (see <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>) preferred a life of compromise and ignoble ease to the national welfare. But it would be incorrect to suppose that because the tribe is omitted in the list of rulers given in <a href="/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>, it had ceased to be a power in Israel. For Gad is also omitted in that list, while among the warriors who came to greet David when he became undisputed king of Israel, Asher sent 40,000 trained warriors, a number exceeding the men of Ephraim, and those of Simeon, of Dan, and of the half tribe of Manasseh (see <a href="/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>.), and far exceeding the numbers of Benjamin, which had never recovered the war of almost extermination waged against it, in consequence of the atrocity at Gibeah (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.). Possibly the reason why so few are mentioned of the tribe of Judah on that occasion is because so many were already with David. There seems no ground for the idea of Dean Stanley, that the allusion to Asher in <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a> is any more contemptuous than the allusion to any other tribe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
