Turning away from the LORD signifies a breach of the covenant relationship established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The historical context involves the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who settled east of the Jordan River. Their construction of an altar raised concerns of idolatry or unauthorized worship, reminiscent of the golden calf incident (Exodus 32). The question serves as a warning against repeating past mistakes and emphasizes the importance of faithfulness to God.<p><b>If you rebel today against the LORD,</b><br>Rebellion against the LORD is equated with sin and disobedience, which has severe consequences. The historical context includes the Israelites' previous rebellions, such as the refusal to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14) and the worship of Baal of Peor (Numbers 25). This phrase underscores the seriousness of rebellion, which is not just a personal failing but a communal threat. Theologically, rebellion is seen as a rejection of God's authority and provision, which can lead to divine judgment.<p><b>tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal nature of sin and its consequences. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the actions of individuals or groups could affect the entire community, as seen in the sin of Achan (Joshua 7). The concept of corporate responsibility is evident, where the sin of a few can bring God's wrath upon all. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and curses are shared among the people (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, it points to the need for communal holiness and accountability. The warning serves as a reminder of God's justice and the importance of maintaining purity and obedience within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is addressing the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben,_gad,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes had settled on the east side of the Jordan River and were being accused of building an altar in rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A significant structure built by the eastern tribes, which was misunderstood by the rest of Israel as a sign of rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose commands and relationship with His people are central to this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The collective body of the Israelite tribes, who are concerned about maintaining faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>The importance of remaining steadfast in our commitment to God and His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>Understanding that our actions can affect the entire community of believers, not just ourselves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_communication.htm">Discernment and Communication</a></b><br>The need for clear communication and understanding within the body of Christ to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_rebellion.htm">Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>Recognizing that turning away from God can lead to His displeasure and consequences for the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_diversity.htm">Unity in Diversity</a></b><br>Embracing the diversity within the body of believers while maintaining unity in purpose and faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_22_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 22:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_22_18_s_warning_today.htm">How does Joshua 22:18 warn against "turning away from following the LORD" today?

After the eastern tribes (Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh) build an imposing altar by the Jordan, the western tribes fear apostasy and send a delegation led by Phinehas. &#8220;And now&#8221; signals urgency&#8212;this is not a matter for debate later; it must be settled immediately (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-14.htm">Numbers 32:14-15</a>, where Moses likewise pressed the tribes for a prompt commitment). The phrase connects past faithfulness&#8212;victorious conquest, rest granted by God (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44-45</a>)&#8212;to the present decision: will they stay the course or drift?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>would you turn away from the LORD?</b><p>The delegation zeroes in on the heart issue: turning away is not merely a geographical move across Jordan; it is spiritual defection. Scripture consistently presents turning away as a deliberate choice that ruptures covenant fellowship (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>). By highlighting the possibility, Phinehas calls them to examine motives and actions, reminding them that the Lord alone is their center (<a href="/psalms/73-27.htm">Psalm 73:27</a>).<p>Helpful parallels:<p>&#8226; When Solomon&#8217;s heart turned after other gods, the kingdom fractured (<a href="/1_kings/11-2.htm">1 Kings 11:2-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s wanderings in the wilderness began with hearts turning back toward Egypt (<a href="/acts/7-39.htm">Acts 7:39</a>).<p>The warning carries weight because faithfulness is relational, not ritual; the altar&#8217;s mere existence is neutral without wholehearted loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you rebel today against the LORD</b><p>Rebellion is framed as present and immediate&#8212;&#8220;today.&#8221; Sin is never theoretical; it is always a real-time decision. The wording echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-28</a>, where blessing and curse hinge on &#8220;today&#8221; obedience or rebellion. The delegation reminds them of recent history: Achan&#8217;s covert theft led to national defeat (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a>). Phinehas&#8217; father Eleazar had witnessed that judgment firsthand (<a href="/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6-9</a>), so rebellion is not abstract.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Covenant obligations apply across both sides of the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/22-5.htm">Joshua 22:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Delayed obedience quickly morphs into rebellion (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Present rebellion nullifies past victories; the land&#8217;s rest can be forfeited (<a href="/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</b><p>Scripture portrays communal solidarity in blessing and judgment. Just as obedience brings shared favor (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>), rebellion invites collective discipline (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-26</a>). &#8220;Tomorrow&#8221; underscores how swiftly consequences can fall; divine anger is not slow paperwork&#8212;it is holy response (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11-12</a>).<p>Cross-references reinforce this principle:<p>&#8226; In Korah&#8217;s revolt, &#8220;all&#8221; the congregation suffered plague until intercession came (<a href="/numbers/16-41.htm">Numbers 16:41-50</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s unfaithful oath led to national hunger (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament echoes the same corporate dynamic in the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>).<p>The warning presses each believer to guard personal fidelity for the sake of the whole body, mirroring Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;watch yourselves and all the flock&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/22-18.htm">Joshua 22:18</a> is a passionate, covenant-rooted appeal. &#8220;And now&#8221; underscores urgency; &#8220;would you turn away&#8221; exposes the peril of drifting; &#8220;If you rebel today&#8221; reminds that sin is a present choice; and &#8220;tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation&#8221; reveals the far-reaching consequences of unfaithfulness. The verse calls every generation to cling to the Lord without compromise, knowing that collective blessing depends on individual loyalty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that ye must turn.</span> The original has the imperfect, of an action not completed, "<span class="accented">and</span> ye <span class="accented">are</span> turning." There is no need to give the adversative sense to! The ye also is emphatic. "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are turning against the Lord today, tomorrow ye will involve the whole congregation in calamity." That tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. This passage also is quite consistent with the circumstances and with the position of the speaker. Not merely anger but fear is visible throughout - fear of His wrath who had manifested His power so signally of late. There was no longer any temptation to rebel against Him. The Israelites were no longer suffering the daily pressure of comparative privation and distress, such as it was impossible to avoid in the wilderness. While, on the contrary, there was every reason to remember His power Who had driven the heathen out before them and planted them in, Who had not failed to punish them when they deserved it, and Who, by the fate of their enemies, had made it clear that His hands were not waxen short. Thus the heads of the tribes, and Phinehas especially, were alarmed lest Israel should forfeit the prosperity they at present enjoyed, and exchange it for those terrible woes that God had shown He could inflict when His people rebelled against Him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
