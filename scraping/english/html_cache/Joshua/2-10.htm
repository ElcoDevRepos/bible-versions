It signifies God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people from slavery in Egypt. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from bondage to freedom. This event is referenced throughout Scripture, including in Psalms and the New Testament, as a testament to God's mighty acts. The drying up of the waters also prefigures the crossing of the Jordan River, emphasizing God's continued guidance and provision.<p><b>and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Israel's victories over Sihon and Og, which are recorded in <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2-3</a>. These victories were significant as they demonstrated God's promise to give Israel the land of Canaan. Sihon and Og were formidable opponents, and their defeat served as a warning to other nations. The Amorites were known for their strength and fortified cities, making these victories a testament to God's power working through Israel.<p><b>whom you devoted to destruction</b><br>The phrase "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to completely destroy or consecrate something to God. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of divine judgment. In the case of Sihon and Og, their destruction was commanded by God as part of His judgment against the wickedness of the Amorites. This action also served to purify the land for Israel's inheritance, ensuring that the influence of idolatry and immorality would not corrupt the Israelites. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to put to death the deeds of the flesh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who performs mighty acts on behalf of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously parted to allow the Israelites to escape from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon_and_og.htm">Sihon and Og</a></b><br>Kings of the Amorites who opposed Israel and were defeated by them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people living in Canaan, known for their opposition to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The account of the Red Sea and the defeat of Sihon and Og reminds us of God's unwavering faithfulness to His promises.

The passage reminds us that the God who once split seas and toppled kings still acts with the same authority today, calling every listener to respond in faith before His righteous judgment arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you.</span> Rahab uses the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. Whether this name were known to her or not, she knew what was signified by it, the one only self-existent God (since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is clearly derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>), the Author of all things, visible and invisible (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">The Red Sea.</span> Brugsch, in his 'History of Egypt,' denies that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> should be rendered 'Red Sea,' and affirms that this error of the LXX. interpreters has been the source of endless misapprehensions. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> is an Egyptian word signifying flags or rushes, which abound not only in the Red Sea, but in the marshes on the shores of the Mediterranean, as, in fact, in all low-lying lands. It is here, according to Brugsch, in a treacherous and well-nigh impassable country, near that Serbonian bog, "where armies whole have sunk" (Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' Book H., line 594), that we are to look for the victorious passage of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, and the destruction of Pharaoh and his host.
