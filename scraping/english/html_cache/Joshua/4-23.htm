The drying up of the Jordan River is a direct parallel to the earlier crossing of the Red Sea, reinforcing God's consistent provision and protection. The Jordan River, at flood stage during the Israelites' crossing, would have been a formidable barrier, emphasizing the miracle's significance. This event marks the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan, symbolizing a new beginning for Israel. It also serves as a testament to God's covenant promises, as the Israelites enter the land promised to their forefathers.<p><b>just as He did to the Red Sea</b><br>This comparison to the Red Sea crossing underscores the continuity of God's deliverance throughout Israel's history. The Red Sea event, a foundational moment in the Exodus narrative, established God's power over creation and His ability to save His people from seemingly insurmountable obstacles. By referencing the Red Sea, the text connects the current generation with their ancestors, reminding them of God's unchanging nature and His ongoing commitment to His covenant. This parallel also serves as a typological foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work, where deliverance from bondage and passage through water symbolize spiritual salvation and baptism.<p><b>which He dried up before us until we had crossed over</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the completeness and thoroughness of God's action. The drying up of the waters allowed the entire nation to cross safely, signifying God's provision for all His people. This act of divine intervention is a powerful reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to make a way where there seems to be none. It also reinforces the idea of collective identity and shared experience among the Israelites, as they witness God's mighty deeds together. The crossing over into the Promised Land is a fulfillment of God's promises, serving as a precursor to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who leads believers into the eternal Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and faithfulness by performing miracles for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses, guiding the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The body of water that God miraculously dried up to allow the Israelites to cross into Canaan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are entering the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The sea that God parted during the Exodus, allowing the Israelites to escape from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.
