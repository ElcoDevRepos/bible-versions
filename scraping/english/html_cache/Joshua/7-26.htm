The act of heaping stones over Achan served as a physical and lasting memorial of the consequences of disobedience to God. In ancient Israel, such stone heaps were often used as markers or memorials (<a href="/genesis/31-46.htm">Genesis 31:46-48</a>). This practice was a communal act, signifying the collective responsibility and agreement of the people in upholding God's law.<p><b>that remains to this day</b><br>This indicates that the memorial was still present at the time the text was written, serving as a long-standing reminder of the incident. It underscores the historical reality of the event and its significance in Israel's collective memory. The phrase suggests the importance of remembering past lessons to guide future behavior, a common theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>).<p><b>So the LORD turned from His burning anger</b><br>This phrase highlights the theological principle of divine justice and mercy. God's anger was a response to sin, which disrupted the covenant relationship with Israel. The execution of justice upon Achan appeased God's wrath, restoring the covenant relationship. This reflects the broader biblical theme of atonement, where sin must be addressed for reconciliation with God (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin to turn away God's wrath (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>).<p><b>Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day</b><br>The naming of the place as the Valley of Achor, meaning "trouble," serves as a perpetual reminder of the consequences of Achan's sin. It is a geographical marker that ties the narrative to a specific location, reinforcing the historical nature of the events. The Valley of Achor is later mentioned in prophetic literature as a place of hope and restoration (<a href="/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>), symbolizing God's ability to transform places of judgment into places of blessing.
