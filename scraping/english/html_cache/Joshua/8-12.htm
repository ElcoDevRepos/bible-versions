This number, while smaller than the entire Israelite army, is significant for a tactical ambush. The choice of five thousand reflects a calculated decision, emphasizing reliance on divine guidance rather than sheer numbers, reminiscent of Gideon's reduction of forces in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>and set up an ambush</b><br>The ambush is a common military tactic in ancient warfare, designed to surprise and overwhelm the enemy. This strategy reflects Joshua's wisdom and military acumen, as well as his obedience to God's instructions. The use of an ambush here is a direct response to the previous defeat at Ai, demonstrating a shift from presumption to careful planning and reliance on God's guidance.<p><b>between Bethel and Ai</b><br>Geographically, Bethel and Ai are located in the central hill country of Canaan. Bethel, meaning "house of God," holds historical significance as a place where Abraham and Jacob encountered God (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8, 28</a>:19). Ai, meaning "ruin," is the site of a previous defeat due to Achan's sin (Joshua 7). The positioning between these two cities is strategic, cutting off potential reinforcements from Bethel and isolating Ai.<p><b>to the west of the city</b><br>The ambush is set to the west of Ai, indicating a strategic placement that takes advantage of the terrain and the element of surprise. This location would have been chosen to exploit the natural landscape, possibly using the hills and valleys to conceal the troops. The westward position also suggests a tactical approach to draw the forces of Ai out of the city, allowing the ambush to be more effective.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.

The principle is consistent: obedience, not sheer size, secures the outcome (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set up an ambush</b><p>&#8226; The ambush was not human cleverness alone; it was God&#8217;s explicit instruction: &#8220;Set an ambush behind the city&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Ambush in Scripture reflects both strategy and dependence on the Lord&#8212;see <a href="/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29-30</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/13-13.htm">2 Chronicles 13:13</a>.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God invites His people to marry prayerful trust with wise planning. The battle is the Lord&#8217;s (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>), yet He expects us to act decisively within His revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>between Bethel and Ai</b><p>&#8226; Positioning the ambush here blocked Ai&#8217;s potential ally, Bethel, from reinforcing the city (<a href="/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The location also resonates with covenant history: Abram first called on the name of the Lord &#8220;between Bethel and Ai&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>). Centuries later, Israel stands in the same place, inheriting what God promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Geography becomes theology: God keeps His word in the very landscapes where He first spoke it (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the west of the city</b><p>&#8226; The main body of Israel camped north of Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-11.htm">Joshua 8:11</a>), drawing the enemy outward. By placing this second ambush to the west, Joshua created a pincer movement&#8212;north and west&#8212;so Ai would be surrounded once lured away (vv. 14-21).<p>&#8226; West is also the direction of sunset, subtly hinting at the &#8220;setting&#8221; of Canaanite power while Israel&#8217;s day is dawning (<a href="/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God is portrayed as the master tactician: &#8220;This also comes from the LORD of Hosts; He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/8-12.htm">Joshua 8:12</a> shows Joshua faithfully executing God&#8217;s plan with a precisely numbered detachment, skillful strategy, and covenant-rich positioning. The verse assures us that when God directs, even a small force placed in the right spot becomes an instrument of certain victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush . . .</span>--Is this a fresh body, or only a portion of the thirty thousand mentioned in <a href="/joshua/8-3.htm" title="So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.">Joshua 8:3</a>? It is, of course, <span class= "ital">possible </span>that the body of thirty thousand, having closed the communications between Bethel and Ai on the first night, and finding that they were more numerous than was necessary, had rejoined Joshua when he came up, and that a small body of five thousand was told off for the service on the next day. But after carefully studying the natural features of the position by the Ordnance map (of which I have been able to enjoy the advantage at this point of my work), I am inclined to think that both forces were employed--the thirty thousand and the five thousand--and for distinct services. There are <span class= "ital">two </span>ravines, which come to a head between Beitin (Bethel) and et-Tel (Ai). The body of men who were to fire the town of Ai were posted in the one nearer to Ai. The larger body, whose business was to prevent any interference from the side of Bethel, were posted in the ravine next to that city, where they had been from the first. If it be remembered, as was before observed, that Joshua was attacking a fortified town, which was protected in flank by another town, and that it was necessary to be prepared for all contingencies from the first, the meaning of his movements will be apparent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took about five thousand men</span> (see above, ver. 3).
