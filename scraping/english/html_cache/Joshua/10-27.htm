Joshua's order to take them down before nightfall adheres to the law that bodies should not remain on a tree overnight, showing obedience to God's commandments.<p><b>and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden</b><br>The cave, initially a place of refuge for the kings, becomes their tomb. This reversal of fortune highlights the futility of opposing God's will. Caves were common burial sites in ancient times, and this act symbolizes the finality of their defeat.<p><b>Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave</b><br>Sealing the cave with stones ensured that the kings' bodies would not be disturbed, serving as a permanent reminder of their defeat. This act parallels the sealing of Jesus' tomb (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>), though with a contrasting outcome, as Jesus rose from the dead.<p><b>and the stones are there to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the historical reliability of the account, suggesting that the stones served as a lasting memorial of God's deliverance.

Joshua obeys, illustrating prompt respect for God&#8217;s law even in the heat of battle.<p>&#8226; Sunset in Scripture often signals closure: the day&#8217;s work is done (<a href="/leviticus/22-7.htm">Leviticus 22:7</a>), anger is to subside (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>). Here it marks the end of the kings&#8217; public exposure and the completion of divine justice on that very day.<p>&#8226; The detail underscores the historical accuracy of the account. Eyewitnesses could easily remember the moment daylight faded and the bodies were removed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees</b><p>&#8220; Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees &#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;They&#8221; are the five Amorite kings captured earlier (<a href="/joshua/10-22.htm">Joshua 10:22-26</a>). Their hanging served as a visible warning, much like <a href="/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a> emphasize public accountability for evil.<p>&#8226; By giving the order personally, Joshua shows hands-on leadership reminiscent of Moses raising his staff (<a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11-13</a>). God&#8217;s appointed leader oversees both the battle and its aftermath.<p>&#8226; The removal also prefigures the greater curse borne by Christ, &#8220;cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). The contrast highlights Christ&#8217;s substitutionary death to save, whereas these kings die for their own sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden</b><p>&#8220; and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden &#8221;<p>&#8226; Earlier, the kings had fled into this very cave (<a href="/joshua/10-16.htm">Joshua 10:16-18</a>).

Practical obedience often dovetails with divine symbolism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave</b><p>&#8220; Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave &#8221;<p>&#8226; The stones seal the judgment permanently, similar to Achan&#8217;s memorial pile (<a href="/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>) and the king of Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Stones in Joshua regularly mark decisive acts of God&#8212;crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>) or covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26-27</a>). Here they testify that God delivers enemies into Israel&#8217;s hand.<p>&#8226; The image also anticipates Christ&#8217;s tomb being sealed (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60-66</a>), yet His stone was later rolled away, contrasting the finality of judgment here with the triumph of resurrection there.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the stones are there to this day</b><p>&#8220; and the stones are there to this day &#8221;<p>&#8226; This phrase, common in Joshua (e.g., 4:9; 8:29), invites readers to verify the evidence. The narrative stakes its credibility on physical markers still visible when the book was compiled.<p>&#8226; It urges each generation to remember God&#8217;s acts. Much like the Passover memorial (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), the enduring stones preach across time: &#8220;God keeps His Word and wins His battles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The permanence contrasts with human kings who fade. <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a> resounds&#8212;&#8220;The word of our God stands forever,&#8221; while monuments to rebellion become silent witnesses of defeat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-27.htm">Joshua 10:27</a> records deliberate, lawful, and symbolic actions that follow Israel&#8217;s victory: at day&#8217;s end the defeated kings are removed from public display, consigned to the very cave they trusted, and sealed under stones that still spoke to later generations. Every detail&#8212;timing, removal, burial, memorial&#8212;testifies that God&#8217;s justice is swift, His leader obedient, and His victories unforgettable. The stones stand as a tangible reminder that the Lord who fought for Joshua remains faithful to all who trust and obey today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the time of the going down of the sun.</span> See <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>. Joshua set the example to the Israelites of a strict observance of the law. And we may observe that this law is only to be found in Deuteronomy. On the "Deuteronomist" theory we have to suppose that the Deuteronomist, with a lynx eye to the chance of recommending the provisions which he had invented, and to the importance of representing Joshua as a strict observer of them, inserted this piece of detail with an obvious purpose. It is a wonder that this should be almost the only "Deuteronomist" precept thus emphasised. We find it noticed above (<a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>), and in both cases the obvious explanation is that this sign of triumph made a great impression on those who witnessed it, and that it was carried out in strict fulfilment of enactments already existing. On the other hand, as we have seen, there is no attempt in <a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a> to emphasise thus the obedience to the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2-8</a>. It is from minute details of this kind, which escape the superficial observer, that the authenticity of the Book of Deuteronomy is established. <span class="cmt_word">Until this very day.</span> The form of the expression here is singularly different from the expression found elsewhere when the meaning suggested by the Authorized Version is to be conveyed. But for the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> we should translate "on the self-same day," as in <a href="/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>, etc. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> may be a slip of the pen for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> which is seldom, if ever, used of time (only, if at all, in Psalm 48:15, and <a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>), though the idiom is found in Arabic, in Greek (as in <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), in German (as in <span class="accented">auf den Tag.</span>) and in English, "on that day;" or we may, with Keil, refer back to ver. 18, and trans. late "they cast them into the cave where they had been hid, and where they had placed great stones unto that very day." For there may have been an interval of several days between the confinement of the kings in the cave and their death at the hands of Joshua. See note on ver. 21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At sunset</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;iw&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that they be taken down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
