These events are recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-3</a>:11. The Amorites were a significant Canaanite group, and their defeat demonstrated God's power and faithfulness to His promises. The phrase "beyond the Jordan" indicates the region east of the Jordan River, which was initially outside the land of Canaan but was later allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh.<p><b>Sihon king of Heshbon</b><br>Sihon was the king of the Amorite city-state of Heshbon. His refusal to allow Israel passage through his land led to a battle in which Israel, under God's guidance, defeated him and took possession of his territory. Heshbon became a significant city in the region, and its conquest is a testament to God's provision and the fulfillment of His promise to give Israel the land of their enemies. This victory is also mentioned in <a href="/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/136-19.htm">Psalm 136:19</a>, highlighting its importance in Israel's history.<p><b>and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</b><br>Og was the king of Bashan, a region known for its fortified cities and giants (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4-5, 11</a>). His defeat was significant due to his reputation and the strength of his kingdom. Ashtaroth, where Og reigned, was a major city in Bashan and a center of worship for the Canaanite goddess Astarte. The victory over Og is frequently referenced in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>, <a href="/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/136-20.htm">Psalm 136:20</a>) as a demonstration of God's might and a precursor to the conquest of Canaan.

These works included:<p>&#8226; The plagues and Red Sea crossing (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14&#8211;15</a>)<p>&#8226; Victories in the wilderness, especially over Sihon and Og (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-33.htm">Deuteronomy 2:33</a>; 3:3)<p>&#8226; Preservation in the desert (<a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>)<p>By the time the Gibeonites speak in <a href="/joshua/9-10.htm">Joshua 9:10</a>, news of these deeds has traveled far, fulfilling Moses&#8217; prediction that surrounding nations would &#8220;hear and tremble&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14&#8211;16</a>).

God&#8217;s judgment on &#8220;the two kings of the Amorites&#8221; served notice that no earthly power could oppose His covenant promises. Their defeat assured Israel that the conquest west of the Jordan would also succeed (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8</a>). Thus <a href="/joshua/9-10.htm">Joshua 9:10</a> highlights God&#8217;s consistency: He deals with sin, protects His people, and keeps His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beyond the Jordan</b><p>&#8220;Beyond the Jordan&#8221; situates the victories east of the river, in territory Israel had not originally planned to occupy (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>). By giving Israel land on both sides, the LORD demonstrated fullness of provision and expanded the borders promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). This location detail also intensifies the Gibeonites&#8217; anxiety: if God already granted Israel unexpected territory, nothing would stop them from claiming all of Canaan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sihon king of Heshbon</b><p>&#8226; Sihon refused Israel peaceful passage (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The LORD &#8220;delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-33.htm">Deuteronomy 2:33</a>).<p>&#8226; His city, Heshbon, became a marker of God&#8217;s triumph (<a href="/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a>).<p>Sihon&#8217;s fall pictures God overturning obstinate opposition.

By naming it, <a href="/joshua/9-10.htm">Joshua 9:10</a> underscores the LORD&#8217;s supremacy over idolatry. When the Gibeonites mention Ashtaroth, they acknowledge a power shift: the living God has displaced false gods, and the wise response is submission, not resistance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-10.htm">Joshua 9:10</a> recounts how the LORD utterly defeated Sihon and Og east of the Jordan. Each phrase underlines God&#8217;s decisive action, His judgment on entrenched wickedness, and His faithful advance of Israel&#8217;s inheritance. The Gibeonites cite these victories to explain their urgency: the God who toppled powerful Amorite kings will certainly conquer the rest of Canaan. For today&#8217;s reader, the verse affirms that God&#8217;s past deeds are reliable indicators of His present power and future faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan</span> (see <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21, 35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ashtaroth</span> (see <a href="/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>; also <a href="/deuteronomy/1-4.htm">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>). In <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. Edrei only is mentioned. This is not the Ashtaroth-Karnaim of <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, which is so called from the worship of the horned Astarte, or crescent (see below), to distinguish it from this Ashtaroth. The two cities were close together. Eusebius and Jerome state that they were only nine miles apart. The site of this city has been identified with Tel Ashtereh, in a wide plain on the east of Jordan. It appears as Astaratu in the Karnak list of cities captured by Thothines III. The name has been identified with the Assyrian <span class="accented">Ishtar</span>, the Persian, Greek, and Latin <span class="accented">aster</span> and our star. So Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Whence Lucian seems to have been wrong in his idea that the worship of Astarte, like that of Artemis at Ephesus, was that of the moon. But Rawlinson, in his 'Ancient Monarchies,' decides against this identification. The last mention of this city in Jewish history is in the bold and successful expedition of Judas Maccabaeus into Gilead, in which he penetrated as far as this city (called Kar-naim), and brought the Jews residing there and in the neighbourhood to Jerusalem (1 Macc. 6.). Kuenen, in his 'History of the Religion of Israel,' makes a distinction between the worship of Ashtaroth and of Asherah. The former he regards as the worship of the moon, and a pure worship; the latter of Venus, and an impure one. But though Asherah and Ashtaroth, or Ashtoreth, are undoubtedly distinct, yet both worships may have been impure, as the worship of Artemis of the Ephesians (the <span class="accented">Diana Multimamma</span>, or the image of fecundity) unquestionably was. "It is probable," says Mr. G. Smith, "that the first intention in the mythology was only to represent love as heaven born, but in time a more sensual view prevailed, and the worship of Ishtar became one of the darkest features in Babylonian mythology." The Babylonian Mylitta, or Venus, was worshipped under a crescent form, as Babylonian sculptures prove. A Syrian altar with the crescent on it is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. It has a female figure on one side, with the crescent, and a male figure - of Baal, no doubt - on the other. Another is mentioned in a late able article in the <span class="accented">Times</span>, as having been found in Carehemish, the Hittite capital. The Chaldaean astronomers had, no doubt, discovered the use of telescopes (though in the translucent sky of Chaldaea perhaps the crescent Venus might be seen without them), for we find Saturn represented on their monuments with a ring (see Proctor, 'Saturn and his System,' p. 197). Consequently the worship of the crescent Venus involves no anachronism. Asherah, often wrongly translated "grove" in our version (see <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>), is probably the goddess Fortune, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>, happiness. Ashtaroth is spelt not with Aleph, but with Ain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">as well as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;
