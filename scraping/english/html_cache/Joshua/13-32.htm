The division of land was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the inheritance of the land by his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The allocation of land was a significant event, as it represented the tangible fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>Moses had given them</b><br>Moses, as the leader of Israel, was responsible for distributing the land east of the Jordan River. This act of giving land was part of his final duties before his death and before the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership. Moses' role as a lawgiver and leader is a type of Christ, who also provides an inheritance for His people (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<p><b>on the plains of Moab</b><br>The plains of Moab were located east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho. This area was significant as it was the final encampment of the Israelites before entering Canaan. It was here that Moses delivered his final speeches, which are recorded in the book of Deuteronomy. The plains of Moab were also the setting for the Balaam narrative (Numbers 22-24), where God protected Israel from curses.<p><b>beyond the Jordan</b><br>This phrase indicates the land on the eastern side of the Jordan River. The Jordan River served as a natural boundary for the land of Canaan. The tribes settled here were given their inheritance before the rest of the Israelites crossed the Jordan into the Promised Land. This area was strategically important for trade and military purposes.<p><b>east of Jericho</b><br>Jericho was one of the first major cities encountered by the Israelites as they entered Canaan. Its location was crucial as it controlled access to the central highlands of Canaan. The mention of Jericho here foreshadows its significance in the conquest narrative, where it becomes the first city to fall to the Israelites under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 6). The fall of Jericho is a testament to God's power and faithfulness in delivering the land to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who, under God's guidance, led them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Scripture contrasts past provision with upcoming conquest, showing God&#8217;s faithfulness both before and after the river crossing (<a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>; 5:10-12).<p>- The detail affirms the historical reliability of the narrative;
