Joshua, the leader of Israel, is depicted as a decisive and strategic military leader. The return signifies the completion of a victorious campaign against the Amorite kings, highlighting God's faithfulness in delivering Israel's enemies into their hands. This return also reflects the cyclical nature of Israel's military campaigns, where they would go out to battle and then return to their base camp.<p><b>with all Israel</b><br>The inclusion of "all Israel" emphasizes the unity and collective participation of the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan. It underscores the communal aspect of Israel's identity and mission, as they were not just individual tribes but a united people under God's covenant. This unity is crucial for their success and is a recurring theme throughout the conquest narratives.<p><b>to the camp at Gilgal</b><br>Gilgal serves as a significant base of operations for Joshua and the Israelites during the conquest of Canaan. It is located near the Jordan River and was the first campsite after crossing into the Promised Land. Gilgal holds historical and spiritual importance, as it was the site of the Israelites' first Passover in Canaan and where the covenant of circumcision was renewed (Joshua 5). The return to Gilgal symbolizes a return to a place of spiritual renewal and covenantal remembrance, reinforcing the idea that their military victories are rooted in their relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.
