Their presence west of the Jordan indicates the strategic and fertile lands they occupied. Historically, the Amorites were known for their fortified cities and military prowess, making them formidable opponents. This phrase sets the stage for the Israelites' entry into a land filled with powerful adversaries, fulfilling God's promise to give them the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p><b>and all the Canaanite kings along the coast</b><br>The Canaanites were the original inhabitants of the land, and their kings along the coast controlled vital trade routes and ports. This phrase highlights the widespread influence and power of the Canaanite civilization. The coastal regions were economically significant, and the mention of these kings underscores the comprehensive nature of the fear that gripped the land. The Canaanites' fear reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to make the nations tremble before Israel (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>).<p><b>heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan</b><br>This miraculous event echoes the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>), demonstrating God's continued presence and power with the Israelites. The drying up of the Jordan served as a divine sign to both the Israelites and the surrounding nations that God was actively working on behalf of His people. It also symbolized a new beginning for Israel as they entered the Promised Land, reminiscent of baptism and spiritual renewal.<p><b>before the Israelites until they had crossed over</b><br>The crossing of the Jordan marked a pivotal moment in Israel's history, signifying the transition from wilderness wandering to taking possession of the Promised Land. This act of crossing over is symbolic of faith and obedience, as the Israelites followed God's command despite the formidable barrier of the river. It also prefigures the believer's journey from death to life, crossing from the old life into the new life in Christ (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><b>their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites</b><br>This phrase captures the psychological impact of God's miraculous intervention on Israel's enemies. The melting of hearts and failing of spirits indicate a complete loss of courage and morale among the Canaanite and Amorite kings. This fear fulfills the prophecy given to Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where she acknowledges the dread that had fallen on the inhabitants of the land. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, culminating in the triumph of Christ over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorite_kings.htm">Amorite Kings</a></b><br>These were rulers of the Amorites, a group of people living in the land of Canaan.

The remaining tribes on the other side Jordan were apprehensive of the same fate. For "on the side," the original has "across." Having hitherto written of Israel as on the eastern side of Jordan, he continues the same expression after he has narrated the crossing. But writing as he did on the west side of Jordan, and for readers the vast majority of whom were on the west side of Jordan, he adds the expression "westward" (literally, <span class="accented">seaward</span>) to prevent any possibility of mistake. <span class="cmt_word">Until we were passed over.</span> The Masorites, in the <span class="accented">Keri</span>, have corrected the text (<span class="accented">Chethibh</span>) into "until <span class="accented">they</span> were passed over." Kennicott states that this reading is confirmed by twenty-seven Hebrew MSS., which have probably adopted the reading from the Masoretic correction. The LXX. accepts the <span class="accented">Chethibh.</span> The probability, however, is that this is one of the many instances of a conjectural emendation of a difficult passage, it not having been seen that the historian was either quoting a document contemporary with the events described, or more probably using the word to identify himself as an Israelite with the acts of his fathers in past times. This is the opinion of Rabbi David Kimchi. Knobel refers to <a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>. See also ver. 6 of this chapter, and <a href="/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5, 6, 7</a>; <a href="/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>; cf. 19. We must not, then, assume from this passage that the Book of Joshua was written by one who himself had a share in the events recorded, in the face of many indications we have of a later origin (see <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>, etc.). A fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the introduction. <span class="cmt_word">Their heart melted.</span> Confirming what Rahab had said (<a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>). Similar terror has often been struck into the hearts of peoples, especially of peoples enervated by habits of licentious indulgence, by the approach of enemies who have successfully and rapidly overcome obstacles deemed insurmountable. Such an effect was produced in Persia by Alexander's victories at the Granicus and Issus. Such an effect, again, was produced in Italy by the tidings of the approach of Alaric and Attila. If we may trust the monk of St. Gall, a similar terror fell on the degenerate Lombards at the approach of Charles the Great, after his daring passage of the Alps. In this case the miraculous element was added, and the inhabitants of Canaan, and of Jericho especially, remained for the time panic stricken, not daring to combine to strike a blow against these daring invaders, who in addition to their bravery seemed under the special protection of Heaven. When they had recovered from the consternation into which the passage of the Jordan had thrown them, the sense of an imminent danger forced them at last to make an effort at resistance (see ch. 10.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
