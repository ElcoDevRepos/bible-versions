The division into seven portions is significant because it reflects the remaining tribes that have not yet received their inheritance. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating a divinely ordained distribution. This division was to be carried out by surveyors, ensuring fairness and adherence to God's commands. The process underscores the importance of order and obedience in the community of God's people.<p><b>Judah shall remain in their territory in the south,</b><br>Judah's territory had already been established, as seen in earlier chapters. This tribe's location in the south is significant due to its future prominence in Israel's history. Judah would become the leading tribe, producing kings like David and ultimately Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah" in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>. The southern location also provided a strategic position for defense and trade, contributing to Judah's strength and influence.<p><b>and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.</b><br>The house of Joseph refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons, who received a double portion of inheritance. Their location in the north is crucial as it places them in a fertile and strategically important area. This territory included significant sites such as Shechem and Shiloh, which held religious and historical importance. The division also foreshadows the later split of the united kingdom into Israel (north) and Judah (south), with the northern kingdom often being associated with the house of Joseph. This separation highlights the distinct roles and destinies of these tribes within God's plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, responsible for leading the people into the Promised Land and overseeing the division of the land among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, allotted territory in the southern part of the Promised Land.

Shiloh becomes the worship center, emphasizing that allotment of land is inseparable from worship. Earlier, eastern Jordan tribes had already received territory (<a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8-33</a>), and western territories for Judah, Ephraim, and Manasseh were assigned (<a href="/bsb/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15&#8211;17</a>). Seven tribes, however, are still &#8220;waiting&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/18-2.htm">Joshua 18:2-3</a>), and Joshua now urges them to act instead of lingering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Specific Instruction: Seven Portions</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-4.htm">Joshua 18:4-6</a> lays out a practical plan:<p>&#8226; Three men from each of the seven tribes will walk the land, describe it in writing, and return.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Divide the land into seven portions&#8221; (v.5).<p>&#8226; Joshua will then cast lots &#8220;before the LORD our God&#8221; (v.6) at Shiloh.<p>The use of lots (cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>) underscores that final boundaries come from God, not human preference. This mirrors <a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>, where Moses told the nine-and-a-half tribes, &#8220;This is the land that you shall inherit by lot.&#8221; The process safeguards unity by removing room for accusation of favoritism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fixed Boundaries for Judah and Joseph</b><p>Verse 5 continues: &#8220;Judah shall remain in their territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.&#8221; Those two blocs&#8212;Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>) and Joseph&#8217;s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; 17:14-17)&#8212;already possess clearly defined borders.

Judah&#8217;s settled south anticipates the Messiah&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).

These words imply that there must be unequal portions of territory for larger and smaller tribes, but that the particular position of each tribe must be settled by the lot, whereof "the whole disposing is of the Lord." We are not told how this rule was carried out in the case of Judah, Ephraim, and Manasseh, who received their inheritance first. Possibly a sufficient extent of territory was surveyed at first to provide three large allotments. The three tribes might then cast lots, first between Judah and Joseph for the northern or southern portions, and then between Ephraim and Manasseh for the two sections of the northern territory. This would carry out the instructions of Numbers 26.
