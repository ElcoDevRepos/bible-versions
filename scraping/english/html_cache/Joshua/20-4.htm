This provision is found in <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. The concept underscores God's justice and mercy, providing protection for those who accidentally caused death, distinguishing between murder and manslaughter. These cities were strategically located throughout Israel to be accessible to all, symbolizing God's provision and care for His people.<p><b>stands at the entrance of the city gate</b><br>The city gate was a place of legal transactions and public affairs in ancient Israelite society. It was here that elders and leaders would gather to make judgments and decisions. This setting emphasizes the formal and legal nature of the asylum request. The gate served as a place of justice, where the fugitive would present his case, reflecting the importance of due process and the rule of law in Israelite culture.<p><b>and states his case before its elders</b><br>The elders were respected leaders and judges within the community, responsible for maintaining justice and order. By stating his case, the fugitive had the opportunity to explain the circumstances of the accidental death, ensuring that his actions were not premeditated. This process highlights the biblical principle of fair hearing and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, aligning with the broader scriptural theme of justice and righteousness.<p><b>they are to bring him into the city</b><br>Once the elders determined the validity of the fugitive's claim, they were to offer him protection by bringing him into the city. This act of acceptance into the city of refuge symbolizes God's provision of safety and sanctuary. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><b>and give him a place to live among them</b><br>The provision of a place to live indicates not only protection but also integration into the community. The fugitive was to be treated with dignity and respect, living among the people of the city. This reflects the biblical call to love and care for the stranger and the sojourner, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of the church as a community of believers, offering refuge and acceptance to all who seek it in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated cities where individuals who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum and receive a fair trial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_city.htm">Elders of the City</a></b><br>Leaders responsible for hearing the case of the fugitive and deciding whether to grant asylum.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fugitive.htm">Fugitive</a></b><br>The person who accidentally caused a death and seeks refuge to avoid revenge from the victim's family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_gate.htm">City Gate</a></b><br>The place where legal matters and community decisions were often made in ancient Israelite society.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asylum_process.htm">Asylum Process</a></b><br>The procedure by which the fugitive presents his case to the elders and is granted temporary protection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_mercy.htm">Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cities of refuge illustrate God's balance of justice and mercy, providing protection while ensuring accountability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The role of the elders highlights the importance of community involvement in upholding justice and offering support.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_refuge_in_god.htm">Seeking Refuge in God</a></b><br>Just as the fugitive sought refuge in the city, believers are encouraged to seek refuge in God through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intentional_vs._unintentional_sin.htm">Intentional vs. Unintentional Sin</a></b><br>The distinction between intentional and unintentional acts calls us to examine our own actions and seek forgiveness where needed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/welcoming_the_stranger.htm">Welcoming the Stranger</a></b><br>The command to admit the fugitive into the city challenges us to be welcoming and compassionate to those seeking help.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_20_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 20:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_20_4_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">How does Joshua 20:4 demonstrate God's provision for justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Steps_for_refuge_in_Joshua_20_4.htm">What steps should a person take when seeking refuge, according to Joshua 20:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_20_4_to_Exodus_21_13_sanctuary.htm">How does Joshua 20:4 connect with the concept of sanctuary in Exodus 21:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_apply_refuge_principles_now.htm">In what ways can we apply the principles of refuge today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Why_must_he_present_his_case_to_elders.htm">Why is it important to "state his case" before the elders, as mentioned?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/City_of_refuge_s_role_in_Joshua_20_4.htm">What is the significance of the city of refuge in Joshua 20:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_20_4_God_s_justice_and_mercy_2.htm">How does Joshua 20:4 reflect God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_needed_cities_of_refuge_in_Israel_5.htm">Why were cities of refuge necessary in ancient Israelite society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_need_refuge_cities_if_god_stops_injustice.htm">Why would a just God need these specific cities of refuge in Joshua 20 if He could prevent unjust killings in the first place?
