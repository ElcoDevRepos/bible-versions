It was a significant city due to its strategic location and its role in the Philistine pentapolis. The mention of Ekron here indicates the northern boundary of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. The "sea" refers to the Mediterranean Sea, marking the western boundary. This phrase highlights the extent of the land given to Judah, emphasizing its reach from inland cities to the coastal regions. The Philistines were often in conflict with Israel, and Ekron is notably mentioned in the context of the Ark of the Covenant in <a href="/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10</a>. The inclusion of Ekron in Judah's territory signifies the intended dominance over Philistine lands, although full control was not always realized historically.<p><b>all the cities near Ashdod</b><br>Ashdod was another key Philistine city, located on the coastal plain. It was known for its strong fortifications and was a center of Philistine power. The cities near Ashdod would have been smaller settlements or satellite towns that supported the main city. This area was significant for trade and military strategy due to its proximity to the coast. The Philistines' control over Ashdod and its surrounding cities often posed a challenge to Israelite expansion and security. The mention of these cities in the context of Judah's inheritance underscores the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Philistines. Ashdod is also mentioned in the context of prophecy, such as in <a href="/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>, where judgment is pronounced against Philistine cities.<p><b>along with their villages</b><br>The inclusion of villages indicates the comprehensive nature of the territorial allotment, encompassing not just major cities but also smaller settlements. These villages would have been agricultural hubs, supporting the larger urban centers. The reference to villages highlights the importance of rural areas in sustaining the population and economy of the region. In biblical times, villages were often the backbone of society, providing food and resources necessary for survival. The mention of villages also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey, as these areas would have been fertile and productive. The detailed listing of cities and villages in the tribal allotments serves to affirm the historical and covenantal claims of the Israelites to the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron.htm">Ekron</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities, located in the southwestern part of Canaan.
