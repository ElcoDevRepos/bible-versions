Unlike the previous battle at Jericho, where all spoils were devoted to the LORD, here the Israelites are permitted to take the cattle and plunder. This reflects a shift in divine strategy and provision, emphasizing God's sovereignty in determining the distribution of resources. The allowance of plunder serves as a reward for the Israelites' obedience and perseverance. Historically, this practice was common in ancient warfare, where victors claimed the spoils of defeated cities. Theologically, it underscores God's provision and blessing upon His people when they follow His commands.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded Joshua</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to divine instruction. Joshua, as the leader, is portrayed as a faithful servant who adheres to God's commands. This obedience is crucial for the success of Israel's military campaigns and their settlement in the Promised Land. The command from the LORD to Joshua is a direct communication, emphasizing the personal relationship between God and His chosen leader. This obedience is a recurring theme throughout the book of Joshua, illustrating the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also serves as a typology of Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father, fulfilling His will. The command to take the plunder, unlike the ban at Jericho, shows God's grace and provision, rewarding the Israelites for their faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
