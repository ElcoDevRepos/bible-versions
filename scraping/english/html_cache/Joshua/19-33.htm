This starting point signifies the beginning of the territorial boundaries for Naphtali, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The delineation of borders was crucial for maintaining tribal identity and inheritance rights as established in the covenantal promises given to Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>and the great tree of Zaanannim</b><br>The great tree of Zaanannim is mentioned as a landmark, possibly a significant oak or terebinth tree. Trees often served as important geographical markers in ancient times. Zaanannim is also referenced in <a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>, where Heber the Kenite pitched his tent near this location. This connection highlights the strategic and possibly spiritual significance of the area during the period of the Judges.<p><b>passing Adami-nekeb and Jabneel</b><br>Adami-nekeb and Jabneel are towns or regions within the territory of Naphtali. Adami-nekeb's exact location is not known, but it is thought to be near the Jordan River. Jabneel is distinct from the Jabneel in Judah and is likely situated in the northern part of Naphtali's inheritance. These locations underscore the detailed nature of the territorial descriptions, ensuring clarity in the division of the Promised Land.<p><b>as far as Lakkum</b><br>Lakkum is another location whose precise site is not identified today. It marks the extent of the boundary line, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the land distribution. The mention of such places, even when their exact locations are lost to history, reflects the historical authenticity and the importance of land inheritance in Israelite society.<p><b>and ending at the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River served as a significant geographical boundary for the tribes of Israel. It was not only a physical border but also a symbol of the Israelites' entry into the Promised Land, as seen in the miraculous crossing led by Joshua (Joshua 3-4). The river's mention here as the endpoint of Naphtali's border highlights its continued importance in defining the tribal territories and maintaining the integrity of the land divisions as ordained by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heleph.htm">Heleph</a></b><br>A location marking the starting point of the boundary for the tribe of Naphtali.
