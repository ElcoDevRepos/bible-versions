This reflects a leadership quality seen in other biblical figures, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>), who also rose early to fulfill God's commands. It underscores the urgency and seriousness with which Joshua approached the situation following Israel's defeat at Ai.<p><b>and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe</b><br>This methodical approach to identifying the guilty party reflects the orderly nature of God's instructions. The process of casting lots was a common practice in ancient Israel for discerning God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). It ensured that the selection was perceived as divinely guided, not arbitrary. This method also mirrors the division of the land among the tribes (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>).<p><b>and the tribe of Judah was selected</b><br>Judah's selection is significant, as this tribe holds a prominent place in Israel's history. Judah is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-3</a>). The selection of Judah here foreshadows its future importance and highlights the gravity of the sin within such a key tribe.
