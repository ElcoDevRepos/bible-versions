It is traditionally identified as the site of the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>), although this is not explicitly stated in the Bible. In the context of Joshua, Tabor marks a boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Issachar. Its strategic location made it a notable point in the tribal divisions of Israel.<p><b>Shahazumah</b><br>Little is known about Shahazumah, as it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. Its inclusion here indicates its importance in defining the territorial boundaries. The lack of archaeological evidence suggests it may have been a smaller settlement or a landmark known to the people of that time.<p><b>and Beth-shemesh</b><br>Beth-shemesh, meaning "house of the sun," was a Levitical city within the territory of Issachar. It is mentioned in several other biblical passages, including the return of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12-15</a>). This city played a role in the religious life of Israel, serving as a center for worship and Levitical duties.<p><b>and ended at the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a significant geographical and spiritual boundary in the Bible. It represents the eastern border of the Promised Land and is the site of many important biblical events, including the crossing by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 3) and the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>). The river symbolizes transition and new beginnings.<p><b>There were sixteen cities, along with their villages</b><br>The mention of sixteen cities highlights the organized distribution of land among the tribes of Israel. This allocation reflects God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and demonstrates the fulfillment of His covenant.

Mount Tabor rises prominently on the edge of the Jezreel Valley, giving Issachar a clearly visible landmark. Because God chose specific, observable geography, His people could always know where they belonged. Compare <a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>, where Deborah summons Barak to gather troops on this same mountain, and <a href="/psalms/89-12.htm">Psalm 89:12</a>, which pairs Tabor with Hermon as witnesses to God&#8217;s greatness. The Lord anchors His promises to real places so His faithfulness can be traced on a map.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shahazumah</b><p>&#8226; Though the town&#8217;s exact location is not yet verified archaeologically, its inclusion underscores that &#8220;every word of God is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>). Scripture does not major on the unknown; it simply records the boundary marker and moves on, expecting our trust. Similar confidence appears earlier in the chapter when lesser-known sites like Hapharaim and Shion are listed (<a href="/joshua/19-19.htm">Joshua 19:19</a>). Even the names we cannot pinpoint remind us that God&#8217;s record of the land grant is complete.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Beth-shemesh</b><p>&#8226; Beth-shemesh sat on a strategic route between the lowlands and the hill country. It later became famous when the Ark returned there from the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-13.htm">1 Samuel 6:13&#8211;15</a>). Another Beth-shemesh lay on Judah&#8217;s border (<a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>), showing that God often reused place names yet kept each tribe&#8217;s allotment distinct. By including this familiar city, the text ties Issachar&#8217;s inheritance to wider biblical history and highlights the unity of God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ended at the Jordan</b><p>&#8226; The eastern border &#8220;ended at the Jordan,&#8221; the same river that parted for Israel&#8217;s entrance (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>) and would later be crossed by Elijah and Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>). Natural features such as the Jordan provided clear limits and daily reminders of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. Standing on that bank, an Issacharite could rehearse how the Lord had brought the nation through on dry ground and settled each tribe &#8220;every man to his own inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were sixteen cities, along with their villages</b><p>&#8226; The count of sixteen towns signals order and completeness. God did not leave Issachar guessing how much was theirs; He numbered the cities and their hamlets, fulfilling the promise that the land would be divided &#8220;by lot as an inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>) and that &#8220;not one word has failed of all the good things the LORD promised&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>). Villages mattered too, showing the Lord&#8217;s care for the ordinary farming communities that sustained daily life (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/19-22.htm">Joshua 19:22</a> records more than ancient cartography. Each landmark&#8212;Tabor&#8217;s height, Shahazumah&#8217;s obscurity, Beth-shemesh&#8217;s familiarity, the Jordan&#8217;s flow, and the tally of sixteen cities&#8212;testifies that God assigns real places to real people and keeps every detail of His Word. Boundaries drawn by His hand assure His people of belonging, protection, and purpose, then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) Tabor (? <span class= "ital">Deburieh, </span>sheet 6).
