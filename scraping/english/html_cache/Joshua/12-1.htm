It highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land of Canaan to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The mention of "kings" underscores the organized and formidable nature of the opposition faced by the Israelites, emphasizing the miraculous nature of their victories.<p><b>whom the Israelites struck down</b><br>The Israelites' victories over these kings were acts of divine intervention, as God had promised to deliver these lands into their hands (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). This phrase reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant and the obedience of the Israelites in following His commands to conquer the land.<p><b>and whose lands they took</b><br>This indicates the transfer of territory from the defeated kings to the Israelites, signifying the establishment of Israel in the Promised Land. The taking of the land was not just a military conquest but a divine mandate, as the land was promised to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>beyond the Jordan to the east</b><br>This specifies the geographical area of the conquests, referring to the Transjordan region. This area includes the territories of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, which were conquered before the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into Canaan proper (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>).<p><b>from the Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon</b><br>The Arnon Valley marked the southern boundary of the territory, while Mount Hermon was the northern limit. This range covers a significant portion of the Transjordan, indicating the vastness of the land conquered. Mount Hermon is also significant in biblical history as a site of ancient worship and later, the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>).<p><b>including all the Arabah eastward</b><br>The Arabah refers to the desert region extending from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. This area was part of the land given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

The verse invites us to remember that every inch of ground gained was a gift of divine faithfulness met by obedient action, assuring believers that the same covenant-keeping God still leads, provides, and conquers today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now these are the kings.</span> The historian now enters upon a complete description of the whole territory which had, up to this date, fallen into the hands of the Israelites. First he traces out the border of the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel, which he describes as bounded on the south by the river Arnon, on the west of course by the Jordan, and as extending from Hermon, past the Sea of Chinneroth, to the borders of the Dead Sea. The eastern border is not clearly defined, but the boundary extended far further eastward in the north than in the south, since the territory of Og was much more extensive than that of Sihon. On the west of Jordan the territory is described as extending "from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Baalbec or Caesarea Philippi; see note on ch. 11:17) unto the Mount Halak which goeth up to Seir, which we have seen to be a range of mountains extending southward from near the south point of the Dead Sea. The border of the Israelitish possessions is more accurately defined in the succeeding chapters, but it was, after all, a slip of territory not more than 180 miles in length by about 100 in breadth. Its influence upon the history of the world, like that of Athens and Sparta, must not be measured by its size, but by its moral energy. As the former city has attained undying fame by its intellectual power, the second by its mihtary capacity, so Palestine has derived her title to fame from her indestructible national life - indestructible because built alone, of all the religious systems of the ancient world, upon the foundations of the unity and Fatherhood of God; indestructible, moreover, because it came by revelation from God. There is no greater argument for the Divine origin of the Mosaic law than the unique spectacle of a national life like that of the Jews, subsisting for nearly two thousand years after their expulsion from their land. <span class="cmt_word">From the river Arnon</span> (see <a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). The word Arnon Signifies <span class="accented">the swift stream</span> (see Gesenius,'Thesaur.' s.v.). It is now called by the Arabs, <span class="accented">El-Mujeb</span>. Seetzen represents the region round its mouth to be naturally most fertile, but as abandoned now to a few wild plants. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Mount Hermon.</span> Now <span class="accented">Jebel-es-Sheikh</span>. We have a vivid description of the scenery of Hermon in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>, with the noise of its foaming torrents, the "deep calling unto deep" from the recesses of its dark ravines, where the infant Jordan rushed along its rocky bed. The Psalmist pictures to himself his troubles as overwhelming him like the billows of the numerous streams that streaked the mountain sides. And yet again Hermon is introduced as the image of peace and plenty and brotherly love. The refreshing dews which distilled from the side of the giant mountain were the source of blessing to those who dwelt afar off, and even the dry and parched sides of Mount Zion were cooled by their delicious influence. In <a href="/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a> the Psalmist speaks of Hermon in the plural. Some have regarded this (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ritter) as referring to the double peak of the mountain. The phrase most probably refers to the region, though Hermon has really three peaks (see note on Joshua 11:3). <span class="cmt_word">And all the plain on the east.</span> The Arabah (see <a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>). The depression of the Jordan, which lay eastward, of course, of Palestine. This is much insisted on in the following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now these [are]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;
