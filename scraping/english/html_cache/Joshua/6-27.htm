The LORD's presence with Joshua is a continuation of the promise given in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>, where God assured Joshua that He would be with him just as He was with Moses. This divine accompaniment is a key theme in the book of Joshua, highlighting that the success of Israel's conquests was not due to military might but to God's intervention. The presence of the LORD with Joshua can be seen as a type of Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God dwelling with His people.<p><b>and his fame spread throughout the land</b><br>Joshua's fame spreading throughout the land signifies the recognition of his leadership and the victories that Israel achieved under his command. This fame was not merely due to human achievement but was a testament to the power of God working through him. The land referred to here is Canaan, the Promised Land, which was inhabited by various tribes and nations. The spread of Joshua's fame would have served as a warning to these nations of the power of Israel's God, fulfilling the fear that Rahab mentioned in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>. This also prefigures the spread of the fame of Jesus Christ, whose name and works became known throughout the regions of Judea and beyond, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites following Moses.
