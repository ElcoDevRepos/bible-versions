The phrase is a divine encouragement, reflecting God's assurance of His presence and support. It echoes the earlier exhortations given to Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6-7</a>) and is foundational for leadership. The strength and courage required are not merely physical but also spiritual, relying on faith in God's promises.<p><b>for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land</b><br>Joshua is tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land, a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The "inheritance" refers to the land of Canaan, a tangible symbol of God's faithfulness. This task involves both military conquest and the distribution of land among the tribes of Israel. The concept of inheritance is significant, as it ties the physical land to the spiritual promise of rest and blessing.<p><b>that I swore to their fathers</b><br>This phrase underscores the covenantal nature of God's promise. The "fathers" refer to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;who received God's promise of land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The oath signifies God's unchanging commitment and serves as a reminder of His faithfulness across generations. It also highlights the continuity of God's plan from the patriarchs to the present leadership under Joshua.<p><b>I would give them</b><br>The certainty of God's promise is emphasized here. The land is not just a future hope but a guaranteed gift from God. This assurance is rooted in God's sovereign will and His ability to fulfill His promises. The phrase also points to the divine initiative in the conquest of Canaan, where God is the ultimate giver, and Israel is the recipient of His grace. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and faithfulness to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the successor of Moses and the leader of the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.
