They were immediately suspected of idolatry by the western tribes (<a href="/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their opening words, &#8220;But in fact we have done this,&#8221; serve as a firm clarification: the altar was not built in rebellion but in obedience and love.<p>&#8226; Like Jacob&#8217;s heap of stones that testified to a covenant with Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-46.htm">Genesis 31:46&#8211;52</a>), this altar was meant as a witness, not as a rival place of sacrifice (<a href="/joshua/22-26.htm">Joshua 22:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for fear</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fear&#8221; here is not cowardice but a reverent concern to protect covenant faithfulness. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The tribes sensed a real danger: geographic separation could lead to spiritual drift, just as later generations of Israelites forgot the LORD in <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10&#8211;12</a>.<p>&#8226; Their fear therefore produced proactive obedience, echoing Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;work out your salvation with fear and trembling&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that in the future</b><p>&#8226; Their vision extended beyond the present skirmish to generations yet unborn, reflecting <a href="/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20&#8211;25</a>, where parents are told to anticipate their children&#8217;s questions about the faith.<p>&#8226; Planning for the spiritual welfare of grandchildren mirrors <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5&#8211;7</a>: &#8220;He decreed statutes&#8230;that the next generation might know them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The altar, then, is a tangible legacy, preaching long after its builders are gone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your descendants might say to ours</b><p>&#8226; Tribal identity was strong, and history shows how quickly Israelites could turn on one another (<a href="/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>; 12:1).<p>&#8226; The eastern tribes anticipated a possible accusation: &#8220;You live across the river; you&#8217;re outsiders.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By setting up a visible witness on the western bank, they provided a continual reminder that both sides shared the same covenant and the same God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?</b><p>&#8226; Spiritual exclusion is devastating.

Had the Hebrew original intended to convey this meaning, we should have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> The literal rendering is, "from anxiety, from a word." The word here translated "anxiety" (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is applied to the sea, and is translated "sorrow" in <a href="/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>. It is translated "heaviness" in <a href="/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>. In <a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18, 19</a>, it is translated "care," "carefulness," and is applied to eating food. It obviously refers to agitation or anxiety of mind, and the proper translation here is, "we did it out of anxiety, for a cause." So Masius and Rosenmuller, who render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> here by <span class="accented">sollicitudo.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have you to do with the Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">What to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel, since He hath given a border between us and between you, sons of Reuben and sons of Gad, even the Jordan.</span> Thus the reason for the erection of the altar was the very converse of what it had been supposed to be. So far from considering themselves as shut out from the communion of Israel by the natural boundary formed by Jordan, the two and a half tribes were resolved that no one else should ever think so. If the descendants of the remainder of the Israelites should ever venture to assert anything of the kind, there was the altar, erected in a conspicuous position on the west side of Jordan, left as a perpetual memorial of the great struggle in which Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh had taken part, and which had resulted in the final occupation of the land of Canaan. Keil and Delitzsch remark that there was some reason for this anxiety. The promises made to Abraham and his posterity related only to the land of Canaan. For their own advantage these tribes had chosen to remain in the trans-Jordanic territory conquered by Moses. It was quite possible that in future ages they might be regarded as outside the blessings and privileges of the Mosaic covenant. For the present, at least, they value those blessings and privileges, and desired to have some permanent memorial of the fact that they had a right to share them. <span class="cmt_word">From fearing.</span> It may be worth while to notice, as a sign of later, or at least of different authorship, that the Pentateuch employs a different (the feminine) form of the infinitive for the form found here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/22-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But in fact</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
