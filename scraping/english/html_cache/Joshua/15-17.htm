He is the son of Kenaz, who is Caleb's brother, making Othniel Caleb's nephew. This familial connection highlights the close-knit nature of the Israelite tribes during the conquest period. Othniel's role as a warrior and leader is further emphasized in the Book of Judges, where he becomes the first judge of Israel (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-11</a>). His capture of the city demonstrates his military prowess and faithfulness to God's command to take possession of the land. The city in question is Debir, also known as Kiriath-sepher, which was a significant Canaanite city. The capture of such a city would have been a strategic victory for the Israelites, contributing to their control over the southern region of Canaan.<p><b>and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage</b><br>Caleb's offer of his daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who captures Debir reflects the cultural practices of the time, where marriages were often arranged to strengthen family alliances and reward bravery. This act also underscores the importance of family loyalty and the continuation of Caleb's lineage through a valiant and faithful warrior like Othniel. Acsah's marriage to Othniel not only solidifies familial ties but also ensures that Caleb's legacy and inheritance are preserved within the tribe of Judah. This marriage can be seen as a type of Christ, where the bride (Acsah) is given to the victorious redeemer (Othniel), symbolizing the church being given to Christ, the ultimate victor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/othniel.htm">Othniel</a></b><br>He is the son of Kenaz and the brother of Caleb.
