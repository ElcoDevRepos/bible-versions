The Gershonites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Gershon, the son of Levi. Their role included the care of the Tabernacle's fabrics and coverings. This allocation of cities reflects the fulfillment of God's command to provide for the Levites, who had no inheritance of land like the other tribes.<p><b>From the half-tribe of Manasseh:</b><br>Manasseh was one of Joseph's sons, and his tribe was divided into two half-tribes, one settling east of the Jordan River and the other to the west. This allocation to the Levites from the half-tribe of Manasseh demonstrates the shared responsibility among the tribes to support the Levites, who served the entire nation.<p><b>They were given Golan in Bashan:</b><br>Golan was located in the region of Bashan, east of the Jordan River. It was a significant city in biblical times, known for its fertile land and strategic location. Golan later became part of the region known as the Golan Heights. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, which aligns with its designation as a city of refuge.<p><b>A city of refuge for the manslayer:</b><br>Cities of refuge were established to provide asylum for individuals who accidentally killed someone, protecting them from the avenger of blood until a fair trial could be conducted. This system underscores the biblical principle of justice tempered with mercy. The concept of refuge is a type of Christ, who offers spiritual refuge and salvation.<p><b>And Beeshterah&#8212;two cities, together with their pasturelands:</b><br>Beeshterah, also known as Ashtaroth, was another city allocated to the Gershonites. The inclusion of pasturelands was essential for the Levites' sustenance, as they relied on these lands for their livestock. The provision of cities and pasturelands highlights God's care for the Levites' physical needs, allowing them to focus on their spiritual duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gershonites.htm">Gershonites</a></b><br>A clan within the Levites, descendants of Gershon, son of Levi.
