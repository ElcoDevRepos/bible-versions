The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised land to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The distribution of land signifies the fulfillment of God's promise and the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families</b><br>Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served as the high priest, representing the spiritual leadership of Israel. Joshua, as the military and political leader, succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land. The heads of the families, or tribal leaders, ensured that the distribution was fair and respected the tribal hierarchies. This collaboration underscores the unity and order within the community, reflecting a theocratic governance where both spiritual and temporal leaders work together.<p><b>distributed by lot to the tribes of Israel</b><br>The use of lots was a common biblical method for making decisions, believed to reflect God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). This method ensured that the distribution was impartial and divinely guided. The tribes of Israel, descended from the twelve sons of Jacob, each received a portion of the land, except for Levi, whose inheritance was the priesthood and the Lord Himself (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>).<p><b>at Shiloh</b><br>Shiloh was the religious center of Israel during this period, housing the Tent of Meeting and the Ark of the Covenant. It was located in the territory of Ephraim, Joshua's tribe, and served as a central place of worship and governance before the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital. Archaeological evidence supports Shiloh's significance, with findings of ancient pottery and structures.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the distribution was conducted in the presence of God, highlighting the sacredness of the event. It reflects the belief that God was actively involved in the affairs of Israel, guiding and blessing the process. The presence of the LORD ensured that the division was just and according to His divine plan.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites. Conducting the distribution at its entrance signifies the importance of seeking divine guidance and approval in national matters. It was a place where God communicated with Moses and the priests, symbolizing His presence and authority.<p><b>So they finished dividing up the land.</b><br>This statement marks the completion of a significant phase in Israel's history&#8212;the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to settling in the Promised Land. It signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to the patriarchs and the establishment of Israel as a nation with defined borders. This completion also sets the stage for the subsequent challenges Israel would face in maintaining faithfulness to God amidst the surrounding pagan cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar served as the high priest and played a crucial role in the distribution of the land among the tribes of Israel.

Spiritual, civil, and tribal leaders work together under God&#8217;s direction, using lots to demonstrate trust in His sovereignty. Conducted at Shiloh, before the tabernacle, the ceremony merges worship with governance and confirms that every promise&#8212;from Abraham to the present moment&#8212;stands fulfilled. The verse invites God&#8217;s people in every age to rest securely in His finished work and to steward His gifts with obedient gratitude.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> The lots were drawn under Divine sanction. The ruler of the State and the ruler of the Church combined in this sacred act, hallowed by all the rites of religion, and confirmed by the presence and approbation of the heads or representatives of all the tribes. Accordingly, as has been said above, we hear of no murmurings or disputings afterwards. However much the Israelites may have quarrelled among themselves, there is not a hint of dissatisfaction with the final distribution of territory. Three points may be noticed here - <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The authenticity of the narrative is confirmed by these evidences of the internal agreement of its parts. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> We learn the value of mutual consultation, of open and fair dealing, from this narrative. The parcelling out of the inheritance of Israel under God's command was carried out in such a manner as to preclude the slightest suspicion of partiality. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The duty of hallowing all important actions with the sanctions of religion, of uniting prayer and a public recognition of God's authority with every event of moment, whether in the life of the individual or of the body politic, finds an illustration here. An age which, like the present, is disposed to relegate to the closet all recognition of God's authority, which rushes into wars without God's blessing, celebrates national or local ceremonials without acknowledging Him, contracts matrimony without publicly seeking His blessing, receives children from Him without caring to dedicate them formally to His service, can hardly plead that it is acting in the spirit of the Divine Scriptures. A well known writer in our age declares that we have "forgotten God." Though the external and formal recognition of Him may be consistent with much forgetfulness in the heart, yet the absence of such recognition is not likely to make us remember Him, nor can it be pleaded as proof that we do so.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These [were]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the inheritances</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1441;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
