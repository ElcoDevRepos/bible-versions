Historically, the Canaanite city-states were often in conflict with each other, but the threat posed by Israel prompted them to form an alliance. This reflects the common biblical theme of God&#8217;s people facing opposition from a united front of adversaries, similar to the coalition of kings in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.<p><b>joined forces</b><br>The unification of these kings signifies a significant military alliance. In the ancient Near East, such alliances were strategic, often formed to counter a common enemy. This mirrors the spiritual battles believers face, where opposition may come from various sources united against God's purposes.<p><b>and encamped at the waters of Merom</b><br>The waters of Merom are identified with a location in northern Canaan, possibly near modern-day Lake Huleh. This site was strategically chosen for its proximity to the northern territories and its resources. Archaeological evidence suggests that this area was fertile and well-suited for sustaining large armies, indicating the seriousness of the threat to Israel.<p><b>to fight against Israel</b><br>The intent to fight against Israel highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the inhabitants of Canaan. This battle is part of the larger narrative of the conquest of Canaan, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It also prefigures the spiritual battles faced by believers, with Israel representing God's chosen people and the Canaanites symbolizing opposition to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_northern_canaan.htm">Kings of Northern Canaan</a></b><br>These were the leaders of various city-states in the northern region of Canaan.

But its name, "the waters of height," would seem to answer to this, the highest of the inland lakes of Palestine. The Jordan runs through it, and it is also the reservoir for numerous other streams. "In the centre of this plain, half morass, half tarn, lies the uppermost lake of the Jordan" - the little lake Phiala excepted - "about seven miles long, and at its greatest width six miles broad, the mountains slightly compressing it at either extremity, surrounded by an almost impenetrable jungle of reeds, abounding in wild fowl, the sloping hills near it scoured by herds of gazelles" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 382). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
