This tactic is reminiscent of earlier biblical battles where God&#8217;s people relied on strategic planning under divine guidance. The north side of Ai would have been a logical choice, as it provided a vantage point and possibly a less fortified area to approach. This positioning also aligns with the broader narrative of Israel's conquest of Canaan, where God&#8217;s instructions often included specific military strategies (e.g., Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>).<p><b>and the rear guard to the west of the city</b><br>The placement of the rear guard to the west indicates a pincer movement, a tactic designed to encircle and trap the enemy. This reflects the wisdom and leadership of Joshua, who was following God&#8217;s command to ensure victory. The west side of Ai would have been significant as it might have been less expected by the inhabitants of Ai, who were likely focused on the main camp to the north. This strategic encirclement is a precursor to the complete victory God promised Israel, demonstrating His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to give the land to His people.<p><b>And that night Joshua went into the valley</b><br>Joshua&#8217;s movement into the valley signifies his role as a leader who is actively involved in the battle, not just directing from a distance. The valley could symbolize a place of vulnerability, yet it is also a place where God&#8217;s presence and guidance are evident. This action parallels other biblical leaders who stepped into challenging situations with faith, such as David facing Goliath. The valley may also represent a place of testing and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, where the valley is a place of trust in God&#8217;s protection.
