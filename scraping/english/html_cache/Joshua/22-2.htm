Joshua, as the leader of Israel after Moses, is addressing these tribes who had settled on the east side of the Jordan River. This moment is significant as it reflects the unity and cooperation among the tribes of Israel, despite geographical separation.<p><b>&#8220;You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you</b><br>Moses, referred to as the "servant of the LORD," highlights his role as a faithful leader and prophet. The tribes had been given specific instructions by Moses to assist their fellow Israelites in conquering the land west of the Jordan before returning to their own inheritance. This obedience to Moses' command demonstrates their faithfulness to God's covenant and the importance of following divine leadership. It also reflects the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua, ensuring that God's plans are fulfilled.<p><b>and you have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you</b><br>Joshua commends the tribes for their obedience to his leadership, which was a continuation of Moses' authority. This obedience is crucial for maintaining the unity and success of the Israelite nation. It underscores the importance of following God's appointed leaders and the blessings that come from such obedience. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's commands as a pathway to blessing and prosperity, as seen throughout the books of Deuteronomy and Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, who led the people into the Promised Land.
