This city was allocated to the Levites, specifically the descendants of Aaron, as part of their inheritance. The giving of this city to the Levites signifies the importance of providing for the priestly tribe, who were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes.<p><b>(that is, Hebron),</b><br>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich biblical history. It was a significant city in the life of the patriarchs, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all had connections to it. Hebron later became King David's first capital before he established Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The renaming from Kiriath-arba to Hebron reflects its transformation from a Canaanite city to a central location in Israelite history.<p><b>with its surrounding pasturelands,</b><br>The inclusion of surrounding pasturelands was crucial for the Levites, as it provided them with the necessary resources to sustain their livestock and support their families. This provision ensured that the Levites could focus on their spiritual duties without the burden of agricultural labor, highlighting the community's responsibility to support those dedicated to religious service.<p><b>in the hill country of Judah.</b><br>The hill country of Judah is a region characterized by its rugged terrain and fertile valleys. It was a strategically important area, offering natural defenses and a central location within the tribal lands of Judah. This allocation to the Levites within Judah's territory underscores the tribe's leadership role among the Israelites and their responsibility to uphold the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>(Arba was the father of Anak.)</b><br>Arba's mention as the father of Anak ties Hebron to the Anakim, a formidable people known for their size and strength. The conquest of Hebron by Caleb, as recorded in the book of Joshua, symbolizes the triumph of faith and obedience over fear and intimidation. This victory prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of darkness, as Hebron becomes a place of refuge and worship for God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kiriath-arba.htm">Kiriath-arba (Hebron)</a></b><br>An ancient city in the hill country of Judah, significant as a city of refuge and a Levitical city.
