Its capture signifies the strategic military campaign led by Joshua to secure the southern region of Canaan. The mention of "its king" highlights the common practice of city-states in Canaan, each ruled by its own king. The inclusion of "all its villages" indicates the thoroughness of the conquest, ensuring that surrounding settlements were also subdued, preventing any future rebellion or threat.<p><b>They put them to the sword and devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors.</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of "herem," a Hebrew term meaning to devote something to God by completely destroying it. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of divine judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and immorality. The complete destruction of Debir and its inhabitants was seen as an act of obedience to God's command, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>. This action also served to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by Canaanite religious practices.<p><b>Joshua did to Debir and its king as he had done to Hebron and as he had done to Libnah and its king.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the consistency and thoroughness of Joshua's military campaign. Hebron and Libnah were previously conquered cities, and their mention here serves to remind the reader of the systematic approach Joshua took in fulfilling God's command to take possession of the Promised Land. The repetition of similar actions against these cities underscores the divine mandate and the importance of complete obedience. It also highlights Joshua's role as a type of Christ, leading his people to victory and establishing God's kingdom, much like Christ leads believers to spiritual victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.
