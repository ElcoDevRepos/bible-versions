But especially observe the expression of Rahab's own belief, <span class= "ital">"</span>Jehovah, your God, He is God in heaven above and in earth beneath." Did the faith of the men of Israel go much further than this? Did it always go so far? (Comp. <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm" title="Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD.">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm" title="And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.

The prophets themselves could not assert much more. The greatest of them were satisfied if they could bring the people of Israel to acknowledge this. Rahab's confession is also one of a series. The Egyptians, Philistines, Syrians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, were all in turn brought to the same acknowledgment by their contact with Israel. The reason is stated in <a href="/joshua/4-24.htm" title="That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you might fear the LORD your God for ever.">Joshua 4:24</a>, "That all the people of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath given.</span> Rahab's faith is shown by this expression.
