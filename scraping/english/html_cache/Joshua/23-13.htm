It reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His word, whether in blessing or judgment. The Israelites are reminded of the consequences of disobedience, echoing the covenantal warnings found in Deuteronomy.<p><b>that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you.</b><br>This refers to the Canaanite nations that remained in the Promised Land. Historically, God had promised to drive out these nations (<a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30-31</a>), but this was contingent on Israel's obedience. The failure to fully conquer the land is a recurring theme in Judges, illustrating the consequences of incomplete obedience.<p><b>Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap,</b><br>The imagery of a snare and trap suggests entanglement and danger. In the ancient Near Eastern context, snares were used for hunting, symbolizing how the Canaanite practices and idolatry could ensnare the Israelites spiritually. This warning is consistent with earlier admonitions in <a href="/exodus/23-33.htm">Exodus 23:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>.<p><b>a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes,</b><br>These metaphors indicate persistent irritation and suffering. The "scourge" and "thorns" suggest physical and spiritual torment, reflecting the consequences of allowing pagan influences to persist. This language is reminiscent of <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>, where similar warnings are given about the inhabitants of the land.<p><b>until you perish from this good land</b><br>The phrase underscores the conditional nature of Israel's possession of the land. The "good land" is a reference to the land flowing with milk and honey, promised to the patriarchs. The potential for perishing from the land is a fulfillment of covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>that the LORD your God has given you.</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty and grace in giving the land to Israel. It serves as a reminder of the divine gift and the responsibility that comes with it. The land is not just a possession but a sacred trust, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

The coming judgment is not random; it flows from the personal, holy God who redeemed them (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). His faithfulness means He keeps promises of discipline as surely as promises of victory (<a href="/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30&#8211;32</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will no longer drive out these nations before you</b><p>God had been Israel&#8217;s warrior (<a href="/joshua/10-14.htm">Joshua 10:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1&#8211;3</a>). If Israel clings to the remaining Canaanites instead of to the Lord, His active aid stops (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1&#8211;3</a>). The loss of divine protection illustrates that victory in the land was always God&#8217;s work, not Israel&#8217;s might (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Instead, they will become for you</b><p>A dramatic reversal follows.

Similar imagery in <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a> shows relentless harassment&#8212;social, spiritual, and military.

The progression&#8212;from divine certainty, to loss of protection, to escalating torment, to eventual expulsion&#8212;reveals how spiritual compromise grows into national ruin. The verse underscores both God&#8217;s unwavering faithfulness to His word and the urgent call to cling to Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snares and traps.</span> Perhaps, rather, <span class="accented">nets and snares.</span> The LXX., where our translation has snare, has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and for traps has incorrectly <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. The snare or <span class="accented">pach</span> was evidently (<a href="/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>) laid upon the earth; but there is no evidence for Gesenius' idea that the <span class="accented">mokesh</span> which follows, there as here, means the stick of the trap, which when displaced involved the bird in the net. As the primary signification of this latter word, which is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> a bow, seems to mean something curved, it is probably a noose or springe. And the word and its cognates are used of involving, or catching, people by its use. Furst's Lexicon confirms this view, which has been independently arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Scourges</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular. It is translated <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, nails, in the LXX., and <span class="accented">offendiculum in the</span> Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">In your sides.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">on</span> your sides. The words here are very similar to those in <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. Moses, however, does but use two of the similes of which here we have four. He has, moreover, a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for thorns, and the word here translated thorns is there substituted for scourges; "thorns in your sides." Joshua crowds together his similes "to describe the shame, and trouble, and oppression which they would bring upon themselves by joining in the idolatry of the Canaanites" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord your God.</span> Here, as elsewhere in this and many other passages, we have in the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> your God. It is important to remember that the sacred writer is calling the God of Israel by His own proper name, that by which He was distinguished from the gods of the nations round about. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/23-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">know for sure</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1433;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
