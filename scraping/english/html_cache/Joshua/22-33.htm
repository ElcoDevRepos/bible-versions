This moment highlights the importance of communication and understanding within the community of God's people. The report in question was delivered by Phinehas and the leaders, who were sent to investigate the altar built by the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Their satisfaction indicates that the tribes east of the Jordan were not in rebellion against God, but rather had built the altar as a witness to their shared faith. This incident underscores the value of seeking clarity and truth before taking action, aligning with biblical principles of wisdom and discernment (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p><b>and they blessed God</b><br>Blessing God in this context signifies gratitude and recognition of His sovereignty and guidance. The Israelites' response shows their acknowledgment of God's hand in maintaining unity among the tribes. This act of blessing God is a form of worship and thanksgiving, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/103.htm">Psalm 103:1-2</a>). It reflects a heart posture that recognizes God's provision and intervention in human affairs, encouraging believers to maintain a spirit of thankfulness in all circumstances (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p><b>and spoke no more about going to war against them</b><br>The decision to refrain from war demonstrates the power of reconciliation and peace over conflict. This outcome is significant in the historical context of Israel, where tribal unity was crucial for survival and fulfillment of God's promises. The potential for civil war was averted through dialogue and understanding, illustrating the biblical principle of peacemaking (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>). This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of resolving disputes within the body of believers, as emphasized in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>).<p><b>to destroy the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived</b><br>The mention of destroying the land highlights the severity of the potential conflict. The land east of the Jordan, given to the Reubenites and Gadites, was part of the inheritance promised by God (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>). Destroying it would have meant not only loss of life but also a breach of God's covenant. This phrase underscores the gravity of internal strife and the importance of preserving the unity and integrity of God's people. It also reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's desire for His people to live in harmony and faithfulness to His commands (<a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective group of God's chosen people, consisting of the twelve tribes, who were settling in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These tribes had settled on the east side of the Jordan River and were initially suspected of building an altar in rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A significant structure built by the eastern tribes, which was initially misunderstood as a potential act of rebellion against the central worship in the tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas.htm">Phinehas</a></b><br>The son of Eleazar the priest, who led the delegation to investigate the intentions behind the altar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites at the time, where the tabernacle was located and where the Israelites gathered to discuss the potential conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_communication.htm">The Importance of Communication</a></b><br>Misunderstandings can lead to conflict.
