In the context of the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel, the western side of the territory is being delineated. The west side often held strategic importance due to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, which was crucial for trade and defense.<p><b>the border curved southward</b><br>The description of the border curving southward suggests a natural or man-made feature that influenced the boundary line. In ancient times, borders were often determined by natural landmarks such as hills, rivers, or valleys. This curvature indicates a deviation from a straight line, possibly due to the topography of the land.<p><b>from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south</b><br>Beth-horon was a significant location in biblical history, known for its strategic military importance. It consisted of two towns, Upper and Lower Beth-horon, situated on a ridge. This area was the site of several key battles, including Joshua's victory over the Amorites (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-11</a>). The mention of a hill facing Beth-horon highlights the elevated terrain, which was advantageous for defense and observation.<p><b>and came out at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim)</b><br>Kiriath-baal, also known as Kiriath-jearim, was a city with historical and religious significance. It was associated with the Gibeonites, who made a treaty with Israel (Joshua 9). The city later became a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant before it was moved to Jerusalem (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). The dual name reflects the transition from Canaanite to Israelite control, with "Baal" being a Canaanite deity and "Jearim" meaning "forests," indicating a change in religious and cultural identity.<p><b>a city of the sons of Judah</b><br>This phrase identifies Kiriath-jearim as belonging to the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Judah was a prominent tribe, known for its leadership and the lineage of King David and ultimately Jesus Christ. The allocation of this city to Judah underscores the tribe's significant role in Israel's history and God's covenant promises.<p><b>This was the western side.</b><br>The repetition of the boundary's orientation emphasizes the completion of the description of this particular section of the territory. It serves as a summary statement, confirming the delineation of the western border of the land allotted to the tribe being described. This careful documentation reflects the importance of land inheritance and tribal identity in Israel's covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-horon.htm">Beth-horon</a></b><br>A strategic location consisting of two towns, Upper and Lower Beth-horon, situated on a ridge.

Real landmarks shaped real borders&#8212;signs of God&#8217;s orderly provision (<a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>).<p>- The southward bend keeps Benjamin small yet secure, fitting the prophetic blessing that this tribe would dwell &#8220;between shoulders&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>).<p>- A curved line around hills and valleys also protected natural routes, preserving the military and trade advantage Benjamin later enjoyed (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the hill facing Beth-horon on the south</b><p>- Beth-horon guarded the critical ascent from the coastal plain up to the highlands.

It carried two names: Kiriath-baal (&#8220;city of Baal,&#8221; its Canaanite past) and Kiriath-jearim (&#8220;city of forests,&#8221; its Israelite present).<p>- The Ark of the Covenant would rest here for twenty years after the Philistines returned it (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1&#8211;2</a>). By tying Benjamin&#8217;s border to this site, the Lord links the tribe to future moments of worship and renewal (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>).<p>- The border &#8220;came out&#8221; here, ending another curve and fixing a corner that Judah and Benjamin both recognized (<a href="/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A city of the sons of Judah</b><p>- Although Kiriath-jearim belonged to Judah, Benjamin&#8217;s line touches it. Tribal territories were distinct yet interconnected, promoting unity under God&#8217;s covenant (<a href="/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>- This overlap enabled cooperation in later generations&#8212;seen when men of Judah and Benjamin jointly rebuilt Jerusalem after exile (<a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4</a>).<p>- The phrase affirms Judah&#8217;s rightful possession while showing how Benjamin&#8217;s boundary respected that claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This was the western side</b><p>- The closing statement wraps up the description, confirming that every landmark just traced makes up the entire western line.<p>- Such repetition locks in the record, leaving no ambiguity for future generations (<a href="/joshua/21-1.htm">Joshua 21:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- The clarity models God&#8217;s character: He states His terms plainly, whether in geography or redemption (<a href="/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14</a> draws a literal, strategic, and God-ordained border for Benjamin. Starting on the west, the line curves south, skirts the fortified heights near Beth-horon, and terminates at Kiriath-jearim&#8212;touching Judah&#8217;s city yet respecting tribal distinctions. Each landmark shows God&#8217;s precision, protection, and purpose, giving Benjamin a secure home while demonstrating the faithfulness of the Lord who keeps every promise in concrete detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the border of the sea.</span> This is a serious mistranslation, arising from the same word being used for <span class="accented">sea</span> and <span class="accented">west</span> in Hebrew. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (some copies have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The literal translation is, <span class="accented">and the border extended, and deflected to the western side.</span> What is meant is that the further portion of the border now described was the western side of Benjamin. <span class="cmt_word">Southward</span>. The western border of course ran in a southerly direction. <span class="cmt_word">Quarter</span>. This is the same word that is translated <span class="accented">border</span> above, in the phrase, "border of the sea." <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-Jearim.</span> Any one who will take the trouble to examine a map will see how much more probable the site Kuriet el Enab is here, than any place "four miles from Beth-shemesh," as suggested by Lieut. Conder. The distance from nether Beth-horon to Kuriet el Enab is not great. It is improbable that the boundary should have run double that distance without any mention of locality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/18-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the west</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
