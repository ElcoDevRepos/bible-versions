Bashan was known for its fertile land and strong cities. Og, the king of Bashan, was one of the last of the Rephaim, a group of ancient giants. This area was strategically important for Israel as it provided a buffer zone against eastern threats and was part of the land promised to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.<p><b>who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei</b><br>Ashtaroth and Edrei were major cities in Og's kingdom. Ashtaroth was likely a center of worship for the goddess Astarte, indicating the presence of Canaanite religious practices. Edrei was a fortified city, highlighting the military strength of Og's kingdom. These cities' mention underscores the formidable nature of the enemy Israel faced and the significance of their victory.<p><b>and had remained as a remnant of the Rephaim</b><br>The Rephaim were a group of ancient giants mentioned in the Bible, often associated with fearsome strength and size.

This victory demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel.<p><b>Moses had struck them down and dispossessed them</b><br>Moses' defeat of Og and the dispossession of his kingdom were pivotal moments in Israel's journey to the Promised Land. This victory was a testament to God's guidance and support, as Moses led the Israelites against powerful adversaries. It also served as a precursor to the conquests under Joshua, reinforcing the theme of divine assistance in Israel's military campaigns.
