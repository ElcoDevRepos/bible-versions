This reflects God's sustaining power and faithfulness. Caleb's vigor symbolizes the spiritual vitality available to those who wholly follow the Lord (<a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). His strength is a testament to a life lived in obedience and faith, contrasting with the fate of the other spies who doubted (<a href="/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>). Caleb's unwavering faith and physical strength serve as a type of Christ, who perfectly obeyed and trusted the Father.<p><b>As my strength was then, so it is now for war,</b><br>Caleb's readiness for battle at his advanced age highlights the importance of spiritual preparedness and reliance on God's promises. His confidence in God's provision for victory is reminiscent of David's faith against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). Caleb's statement underscores the biblical theme that true strength comes from God (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). His willingness to engage in warfare for the promised land prefigures the spiritual warfare Christians face, relying on God's strength to overcome (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<p><b>for going out, and for coming in.</b><br>This phrase signifies the totality of Caleb's life activities, encompassing both daily routines and extraordinary endeavors. It reflects the biblical concept of living under God's guidance and protection (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>). Caleb's life, marked by faithfulness and divine favor, serves as an example of a life fully committed to God's purposes. This mirrors the life of Jesus, who perfectly fulfilled His mission, going out to minister and coming in to commune with the Father (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>).

Scripture consistently portrays the Lord as the One who renews and preserves strength:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-15</a> affirms that &#8220;they will still bear fruit in old age.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a> promises fresh strength to those who wait on the Lord.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a> records that Moses, at 120, still had undimmed vision and vigor.<p>Caleb&#8217;s words show that age does not limit God&#8217;s ability to empower His faithful servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As I was the day Moses sent me out</b><p>Caleb looks back to the moment Moses sent the twelve spies from Kadesh-barnea (<a href="/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1-6</a>). Forty-five years have passed, yet his zeal and faith remain unchanged. <a href="/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a> notes that Caleb &#8220;had a different spirit and followed Me fully,&#8221; and that wholehearted devotion is still visible. God preserved not only his body but also his resolve, illustrating <a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>: &#8220;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As my strength was then</b><p>The repetition underscores certainty: Caleb&#8217;s physical stamina, courage, and clarity of purpose are identical to what they were at forty. <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, which Caleb surely heard from Moses, commanded, &#8220;Be strong and courageous&#8230; for the LORD your God goes with you.&#8221; Caleb&#8217;s life proves that command feasible; his strength flows from God&#8217;s unfailing presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So it is now for war</b><p>Caleb&#8217;s strength has a purpose: he is ready to conquer the hill country still occupied by the Anakim (<a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The same warrior heart that trusted God against giants in <a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a> now prepares to face them again.<p>&#8226; Believers today engage in spiritual warfare with the same confidence (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>Caleb&#8217;s readiness demonstrates that long-standing promises often call for long-lasting perseverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For going out</b><p>&#8220;Going out&#8221; speaks of daily activity, leadership, and public engagement. Moses used the phrase when he acknowledged that he could no longer lead Israel in that way (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>). Caleb, however, can still take the field:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a> assures, &#8220;The LORD will watch over your going out&#8230; both now and forevermore.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every ordinary step is under divine care, whether marching to battle or tending family responsibilities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And for coming in</b><p>&#8220;Coming in&#8221; covers the return, the completion of tasks, and safe re-entry into community life. Solomon used the phrase of royal responsibilities (<a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Jesus pictures abundant life as one who &#8220;will go in and out and find pasture&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>). Caleb trusts God not only for conflict but also for the peace that follows, confident the Lord guards each transition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a> showcases Caleb&#8217;s unwavering vitality as the product of God&#8217;s faithfulness. From youthful scouting to senior conquest, his strength is intact for every arena&#8212;warfare, daily ventures, and safe homecomings. The verse calls believers to trust that the same Lord who empowered Caleb stands ready to sustain and energize all who follow Him wholeheartedly, whatever their age or assignment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">As yet I am as strong this day . . .</span>--But by <a href="/joshua/13-1.htm" title="Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.">Joshua 13:1</a>, "Joshua had aged." Yet Joshua died at the age of 110, only 25 years older than Caleb was at this time. They were contemporaries. But the far greater responsibility lying upon Joshua (with a possible difference of temperament) may very naturally account for the one man's having aged so much more rapidly than the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As yet am I as strong this day.</span> A vigorous and respected old age is ordinarily, by Nature's own law, the decreed reward for a virtuous youth and a temperate manhood. Caleb's devotion to God's service had preserved him from the sins as well as from the faithlessness and murmuring of the Israelites. And thus, with a body not enfeebled by indulgence, he presents himself before Joshua with undiminished strength, at a time when most men are sinking under the weight of their infirmities, and is ready still for battle with the most formidable foes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">still</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1448;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;en&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124;
