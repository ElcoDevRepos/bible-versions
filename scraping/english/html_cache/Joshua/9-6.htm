It was a place of significant spiritual renewal, where the Israelites celebrated the Passover and circumcised the new generation (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2-12</a>). The location symbolizes a new beginning and commitment to God&#8217;s covenant. The Gibeonites' approach to Joshua at Gilgal highlights the strategic importance of this site as a center of Israelite leadership and decision-making.<p><b>and said to him and the men of Israel</b><br>The Gibeonites addressed both Joshua and the leaders of Israel, recognizing the collective authority in decision-making. This reflects the communal leadership structure of the Israelites, where decisions were often made in consultation with elders and leaders. It also underscores the importance of unity and collective responsibility in the Israelite community.<p><b>&#8220;We have come from a distant land;</b><br>The claim of coming from a distant land was a deception by the Gibeonites, intended to secure a peace treaty with Israel. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of forming alliances and treaties, often based on perceived distance and non-threat. The Gibeonites' ruse was a strategic move to protect themselves from the advancing Israelites, who were commanded by God to conquer the inhabitants of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>).<p><b>please make a treaty with us.&#8221;</b><br>The request for a treaty was a plea for protection and peace. In the ancient world, treaties were formal agreements that established terms of peace and mutual obligations. The Gibeonites sought to align themselves with Israel, recognizing the power and favor of Israel's God. This request also foreshadows the later inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, pointing to the broader biblical theme of God's salvation extending beyond Israel (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gibeonites.htm">The Gibeonites</a></b><br>A group of people from the region of Canaan who deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them by pretending to be from a distant land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who were conquering the land of Canaan as God had commanded.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>The Israelite camp and base of operations during the conquest of Canaan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deception.htm">The Deception</a></b><br>The event where the Gibeonites tricked the Israelites into making a treaty by pretending to be from a far-off land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_decision-making.htm">Discernment in Decision-Making</a></b><br>The Israelites failed to seek God's guidance before making a treaty.

That reminds us that &#8220;every matter is established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>) and that leaders are accountable for the covenants they endorse. Their direct appeal to Joshua parallels later pleas for mercy, such as Rahab&#8217;s request in <a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12&#8211;13</a>, showing how foreign peoples recognized Israel&#8217;s authority under God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the camp at Gilgal</b><p>Gilgal was Israel&#8217;s base after crossing the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>). At that very spot the reproach of Egypt was &#8220;rolled away&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>). By choosing Gilgal, the Gibeonites stepped onto ground where God&#8217;s faithfulness had been freshly celebrated. The scene underscores that spiritual victories must be guarded, for deception can sneak in right where God&#8217;s people feel most secure (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And said to him and the men of Israel</b><p>The whole covenant community was addressed, not Joshua alone, echoing how Moses often gathered &#8220;all Israel&#8221; to hear the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1</a>). This collective hearing highlights that agreements impact everyone&#8212;husbands, wives, children, leaders, followers (<a href="/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18</a>). <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> notes, &#8220;Victory is won through many counselors,&#8221; yet counsel is useless when based on partial truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have come from a distant land</b><p>Here the deception begins. Treaties were permitted with remote nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-15.htm">Deuteronomy 20:15</a>) but forbidden with Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). By claiming distance, the Gibeonites manipulated a legitimate ordinance. Their strategy warns us that lies often ride on half-truths: &#8220;A false witness pours out lies&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-5.htm">Proverbs 14:5</a>). The church today must test spirits and claims (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>), not merely accept appearances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please make a treaty with us</b><p>The Hebrew concept of a treaty is a binding covenant, solemnized before God. Israel had just renewed covenant commitments on Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>). Entering another covenant without seeking the Lord contradicted that renewal (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a> warned, &#8220;You shall make no covenant with them.&#8221; The Gibeonite request presented Joshua with a decision that would ripple through generations (<a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>), reminding believers that impulsive oaths can entangle God&#8217;s people for years (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a> portrays a pivotal moment where cunning outsiders appealed directly to Israel&#8217;s leader at a place of recent victory, using half-truths to secure protection. The verse teaches that leadership, location, communal involvement, deceptive appearances, and covenant commitments all converge when God&#8217;s people face choices. Discernment, prayer, and fidelity to God&#8217;s explicit commands are essential safeguards against entangling alliances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the camp at Gilgal.</span> Many commentators, among whom we may number Vandevelde and the recent Palestine Exploration Expedition, suppose that the Gilgal mentioned here is <span class="accented">another</span> Gilgal, and certainly the supposition derives great force from the fact that there is a place the modern name of which is Jiljilia, situated near the oaks of Moreh, whose situation would be far more central, and would fall in better with the rest of the history (see notes on Joshua 8:30), than the original Gilgal. That such a second Gilgal is known to Jewish history would appear from <a href="/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, where its situation is clearly pointed out as that of the modern Jiljilia, near the oaks of Moreh, and near theArabah (<span class="accented">champaign</span>, Authorised Version), which runs in that direction. Jiljulieh, in the plain of Sharon, is supposed by Vandevelde and the Palestine explorers (see 'Quarterly Statement,' Jan., 1879) to be a <span class="accented">third</span> Gilgal, and Jerome, in his 'Onomasticon,' has identified it (see note on Joshua 12:23). The Gilgal in <a href="/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4-12</a> seems to require a central position like that of Jiljilia, rather than a place near the fords of Jordan. As Ewald reminds us, the earlier Gilgal lay out of the road from Jericho to Bethel (see also <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-6</a>). The only argument against such a second Gilgal is the improbability of a removal of the camp without any mention of such removal by the historian (see Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 207), and the improbability of there having been a second Gilgal as the place of encampment of the Israelites. It is possible, however, that the second great place of encampment received the memorable name of the first, from the keen sense that the Israelitish encampment was the abode of a people from which the "reproach of Egypt" was forever rolled away. Another explanation is suggested by a comparison of <a href="/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a> with <a href="/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a> (see note on the former passage). The second Gilgal, if it really existed, was well suited for its purpose. "It was in the centre of the country, situated upon a steep hill, with a good table land at the top, and commanded a most extensive prospect of the large plain in the west, and also towards the north and east" (Keil) - precisely the place which an able general would be likely to select. Though "in a high position" (Vandevelde), it was "lower than Gibeon," and was "an hour west of Sinjil on the Jerusalem Shechem road." Its situation enabled Joshua to strike a decisive blow without delay (<a href="/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7, 9</a>). It is clear that this suggestion entirely obviates the difficulty of the concluding verses of ch. 8. And as the name implies a circular form as well as motion, and early camps were usually circular, it may have been the ordinary name for an encampment among the Hebrews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1447;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
