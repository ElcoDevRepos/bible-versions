Gibeon was a significant city, described as a great city, like one of the royal cities, and greater than Ai (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). Archaeological evidence suggests that Gibeon was a well-fortified city with a strategic location, which would have made it a valuable ally or a formidable enemy. The Gibeonites' decision to seek peace with Israel reflects their awareness of the Israelites' divine mandate to conquer Canaan.<p><b>having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai</b><br>The news of Israel's victories at Jericho and Ai spread quickly throughout Canaan, instilling fear among the inhabitants. Jericho's fall was miraculous, with its walls collapsing after the Israelites marched around them for seven days (Joshua 6). Ai, on the other hand, was initially a site of defeat due to Achan's sin but was later conquered through strategic military tactics (Joshua 7-8). The Gibeonites' response to these events indicates their recognition of the power of Israel's God, who was fighting for them. This acknowledgment of divine intervention is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<p><b>what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai</b><br>Joshua, as the leader of Israel, was instrumental in executing God's commands for the conquest of Canaan. His actions at Jericho and Ai demonstrated both divine guidance and human obedience. The destruction of these cities served as a warning to other Canaanite nations about the fate awaiting those who opposed Israel. The Gibeonites' decision to seek a treaty with Israel can be seen as a pragmatic move to avoid destruction, contrasting with the resistance of other Canaanite kings. This phrase also highlights the role of Joshua as a type of Christ, leading his people to victory and securing their inheritance, much like Jesus leads believers to spiritual victory and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant Canaanite city-state known for its strategic location and later integration into Israel.

The narrative has just recounted the Canaanite kings joining forces against Israel (<a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1-2</a>). Now, a different reaction appears.<p>- Scripture often pivots on a &#8220;but&#8221; to highlight God&#8217;s unfolding plan (e.g., <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>). Here, the shift prepares us to see a city choosing craft over combat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people of Gibeon</b><p>- Gibeon was a prominent Hivite city, later described as &#8220;a great city, like one of the royal cities&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>).<p>- Located only a day&#8217;s journey from Gilgal, Gibeon faced an immediate threat once Israel crossed the Jordan and captured central Canaan.<p>- Unlike other Hivites who rallied for war (<a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-4</a>), these citizens considered another path. Their distinct choice fulfills <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will send My terror before you,&#8221; causing some inhabitants to melt in fear rather than fight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>having heard</b><p>- News of Israel&#8217;s victories spread quickly, just as Rahab reported in Jericho: &#8220;We have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>).<p>- Hearing God&#8217;s deeds demands a response&#8212;either humble submission (<a href="/psalms/66-3.htm">Psalm 66:3-5</a>) or hardened resistance (<a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20-21</a>). The Gibeonites opt for the former.<p>- <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;So faith comes by hearing.&#8221; While their faith is mixed with self-preservation, they still acknowledge the LORD&#8217;s unstoppable power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what Joshua had done</b><p>- Joshua&#8217;s actions are inseparable from God&#8217;s command; the victories belong to the LORD (<a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>).<p>- God exalted Joshua in Israel&#8217;s eyes (<a href="/joshua/4-14.htm">Joshua 4:14</a>), and the pagan towns recognized that divine backing. The Gibeonites discerned that opposing Joshua meant opposing Israel&#8217;s covenant God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jericho</b><p>- Jericho&#8217;s impregnable walls collapsed at God&#8217;s word (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20-21</a>).

The conjunction &#8220;but&#8221; introduces Gibeon&#8217;s unique response; the people, fully informed of God&#8217;s recent, literal acts at Jericho and Ai, choose diplomacy over war. Their decision illustrates the widespread impact of God&#8217;s triumphs through Joshua, the certainty of His promises, and the way information about His mighty works forces every listener to choose submission or rebellion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE GIBEONITES MAKE PEACE WITH JOSHUA (<a href="/context/joshua/9-3.htm" title="And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,">Joshua 9:3-27</a>).<p>(3) <span class= "bld">The inhabitants of Gibeon.</span>--Hivites, as appears by <a href="/joshua/9-7.htm" title="And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?">Joshua 9:7</a>. Gibeon was one member of a tetrapolis, or community of four cities, as is seen in <a href="/joshua/9-17.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.">Joshua 9:17</a>. Their deception of Joshua and the Israelites on this occasion is a curious compensation for what was done by Simeon and Levi to the Hivites long before, when Jacob first came to Shechem from Padan-Aram (see Genesis 34). On that occasion, the inhabitants of a single city of the Hivites were put to the sword by Israel, by means of a stratagem; on this occasion, a stratagem saved four Hivite cities from destruction by Israel's sword.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Gibeon.</span> That is, of a confederation of cities (see ver. 17), of which Gibeon was the head. Gibeon was a city of some importance (<a href="/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). Though it was for size and importance "as one of the royal cities," we hear nothing of a king there. Hengstenberg, in his history, describes it (p. 227) as "eine freie Stadt," with daughter cities dependent on it. In fact, the Phoenician cities (see Introduction) seem to have had as great a variety of constitution as those of ancient Greece. Its inhabitants were Hivites (ver. 7, and <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). Its name (compare Gibeah and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> a hill) signifies hill city, like the termination <span class="accented">dunum</span> in Latin, as Lugdunum, or Lyons; <span class="accented">dune</span> in Anglo-Saxon, as <span class="accented">Ethandune.</span> Compare also Dunkirk. Robinson, in his 'Biblical Researches,' 2:135-9, identifies it with el-Jib, a village on an eminence in the midst of a fertile plain, where the remains of large buildings may still be seen. (So Vandevelde and Condor.) "Onely the Hivites are wiser than their fellowes, and will rather yeeld and live. Their intelligence was not diverse from the rest; all had equally heard of the miraculous conduct and successe of Israel; but their resolution was diverse. As Rahab saved her family in the midst of Jericho, so these foure cities preserved themselves in the midst of Canaan; and both of them by beleeving what God would do. The efficacie of God's marvellous works is not in the acts themselves, but in our apprehension" (Bp. Hall). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Gibeon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1391.htm">Strong's 1391: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gibeon -- a Levitical city in Benjamin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">having heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1435;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Jericho</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3405.htm">Strong's 3405: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jericho -- a city in the Jordan Valley captured by Joshua</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Ai,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5857.htm">Strong's 5857: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ai -- a Canaanite city</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">OT History: Joshua 9:3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard (Josh.
