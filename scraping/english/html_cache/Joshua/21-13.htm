Aaron, the brother of Moses, was the first high priest, and his lineage was given special status among the Israelites. This allocation of cities reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to provide for the Levites, who did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).<p><b>they gave these cities, together with their pasturelands:</b><br>The Levites were given cities to dwell in, along with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock. This provision ensured that the Levites could sustain themselves while focusing on their priestly duties. The pasturelands were typically a radius of 2,000 cubits around the city (<a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4-5</a>), allowing for agricultural activities necessary for their livelihood.<p><b>Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer,</b><br>Hebron was one of the six cities of refuge designated for those who committed unintentional manslaughter (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). It provided asylum from the avenger of blood until a fair trial could be conducted. Hebron holds significant historical and spiritual importance, being associated with Abraham and the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). It symbolizes God's provision of justice and mercy, prefiguring Christ as our refuge (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p><b>Libnah,</b><br>Libnah was a Levitical city located in the Shephelah region of Judah. It played a role in various biblical narratives, including the rebellion against King Jehoram (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). The name "Libnah" means "whiteness," possibly referring to its geographical features or purity.

Hebron illustrates mercy and covenant continuity; Libnah reminds us that every place and person can be set apart for His purposes.
