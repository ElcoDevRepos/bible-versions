This brook, likely a seasonal stream, marked the boundary between the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, two of the tribes descended from Joseph. The delineation of borders was crucial for maintaining tribal identities and inheritance rights, as seen in <a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>, where God commands the Israelites to divide the land. The southward direction indicates the movement from the northern territories, emphasizing the organized distribution of the Promised Land.<p><b>There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh,</b><br>This phrase highlights the intermingling of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, both sons of Joseph. Despite the distinct tribal allocations, the presence of Ephraimite cities within Manasseh's territory suggests a close relationship and cooperation between these tribes. This arrangement reflects the broader unity among the Israelites, as seen in their shared history and covenant with God. The cities' distribution also underscores the fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a>, where Ephraim and Manasseh are both promised prosperity and growth.<p><b>but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook</b><br>The specific mention of Manasseh's border being on the north side of the Brook of Kanah reinforces the importance of clear territorial boundaries. This demarcation ensured that each tribe could maintain its inheritance, as commanded in <a href="/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>. The north side positioning also indicates Manasseh's significant landholdings, which extended beyond the Jordan River, reflecting the tribe's strength and prominence among the Israelites.<p><b>and ended at the Sea.</b><br>The "Sea" referred to here is likely the Mediterranean Sea, which served as the western boundary for several tribes, including Manasseh. This natural boundary provided a clear and definitive end to the territory, aligning with God's promise of land from the wilderness to the sea in <a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>.

That the border of Manasseh lay to the northward of the brook is asserted twice over in the latter part of this and the next verse.
