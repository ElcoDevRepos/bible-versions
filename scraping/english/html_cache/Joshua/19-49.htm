The distribution was done by casting lots, a method believed to reflect God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). This event fulfills God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The division of the land signifies the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled existence, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's covenant and the establishment of Israel as a nation.<p><b>the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,</b><br>Joshua, as the leader who succeeded Moses, played a crucial role in the conquest and distribution of the land.

His inheritance was in Timnath-Serah in the hill country of Ephraim (<a href="/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>), aligning with his tribal affiliation. This act of giving Joshua an inheritance highlights the respect and gratitude of the Israelites towards him. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, though deserving of all, humbled Himself for the sake of others (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).

(a) Historically. Joshua waited for his own inheritance until the last. He sought not his own interest, but that of the people.

What does this mean in the case of the true Joshua? <span class= "ital">"Ask of me, </span>and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession." He must reign till God hath put <span class= "ital">all enemies under His feet. </span>Then, and not till then, will He take His own personal inheritance, and be subject to Him that put all things under Him.
