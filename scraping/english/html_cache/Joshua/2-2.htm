The king of Jericho would have been a local ruler, possibly a vassal under a larger Canaanite confederation. The report reaching the king indicates a well-organized intelligence network within the city, highlighting the tension and fear among the Canaanites due to the Israelites' approach. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God orchestrating events to fulfill His promises to Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight:</b><br>The phrase "some men of Israel" refers to the two spies sent by Joshua, as detailed earlier in the chapter. Their mission was to gather intelligence on Jericho's defenses and the morale of its people. The mention of "tonight" suggests urgency and secrecy, emphasizing the covert nature of their mission. This aligns with the biblical narrative of God using seemingly small and secretive actions to achieve His purposes, as seen in other biblical accounts like Gideon's night attack (Judges 7).<p><b>to spy out the land.&#8221;</b><br>Spying out the land was a common military tactic in ancient times, used to assess the strength and weaknesses of enemy territories. This mission echoes the earlier reconnaissance of Canaan by the twelve spies in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, though with a more successful outcome. Theologically, this act of spying can be seen as a step of faith and obedience to God's command to take possession of the land He promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The spies' mission foreshadows the eventual conquest of Jericho, demonstrating God's faithfulness in delivering the land to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_jericho.htm">King of Jericho</a></b><br>The ruler of the city of Jericho, a significant Canaanite city.
