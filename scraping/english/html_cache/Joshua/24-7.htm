The act of crying out signifies a deep, earnest plea for divine intervention, reflecting a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where God's people call upon Him in times of need (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). This cry is a turning point, leading to God's deliverance, and it underscores the importance of prayer and reliance on God.<p><b>and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians</b><br>This refers to the miraculous event during the Exodus when God provided a cloud of darkness to separate the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptian army (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>). This divine intervention not only protected the Israelites but also demonstrated God's power over creation. The darkness symbolizes God's judgment on the Egyptians and His protection over His chosen people, reminiscent of the plague of darkness in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>).<p><b>over whom He brought the sea and engulfed them</b><br>This phrase recalls the parting of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in Israel's history where God demonstrated His sovereignty and power by allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground and then drowning the Egyptian army (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-28</a>). This act of deliverance is frequently referenced in Scripture as a testament to God's faithfulness and might (<a href="/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13-15</a>). It prefigures baptism, symbolizing salvation and the washing away of sin.<p><b>Your very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians</b><br>The emphasis on the Israelites' eyewitness experience serves as a reminder of God's tangible acts of salvation. It reinforces the authenticity of the event and the responsibility of the witnesses to remember and pass down the story of God's deliverance. This personal experience of God's power is meant to strengthen faith and obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>).<p><b>Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time</b><br>This phrase refers to the 40-year period of wandering in the wilderness, a time of testing and reliance on God for provision (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-4</a>). It was a formative period for the Israelites, during which they received the Law and learned to trust in God's guidance.

This identification of the Israel of Joshua's day with their forefathers is common in this book (see notes on Joshua 6:21, dec.). <span class="cmt_word">A long season.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">many days.</span> Here, again, there is no discrepancy between the books of Moses and this epitome of their contents. If both this speech and the Pentateuch were a clumsy patchwork, made up of scraps of this narrative and that, flung together at random, this masterly abstract of the contents of the Pentateuch is little short of a miracle.
