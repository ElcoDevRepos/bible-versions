The Kohathites, specifically, were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects. This allocation of cities reflects the fulfillment of God's command in <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where the Levites were to be given cities to dwell in, along with pasturelands for their livestock. The distribution of these cities among the Levites ensured that they were spread throughout Israel, facilitating their role in teaching the Law and maintaining the spiritual life of the nation.<p><b>From the tribe of Ephraim</b><br>Ephraim was one of the tribes descended from Joseph, Jacob's son, and was often associated with leadership and prominence in Israel. The tribe of Ephraim held a significant position in the central hill country of Canaan, an area known for its fertility and strategic importance. The allocation of cities to the Kohathites within Ephraim's territory underscores the integration of the Levites into the life of the nation, ensuring that spiritual guidance was accessible to all tribes. Ephraim's central location also symbolically represents the centrality of worship and the presence of God among His people.
