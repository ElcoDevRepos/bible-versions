Moses granted their request on the condition that their fighting men would assist the other tribes in conquering the land west of the Jordan. The mention of "wives, young children, and livestock" highlights the importance of family and possessions in ancient Israelite society, reflecting the agrarian lifestyle and the need for stability and security. This arrangement also underscores the communal responsibility and unity among the tribes, as they were to support each other in the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>But all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers and help them,</b><br>The "mighty men of valor" refers to the capable warriors from these tribes, emphasizing their role as protectors and defenders. The requirement for them to be "armed for battle" indicates the seriousness of the military campaign and the need for preparedness. Crossing "ahead of your brothers" signifies leadership and the willingness to take on the initial risks in battle, demonstrating courage and commitment to the collective mission. This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of brotherhood and mutual support, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>, which speaks to the strength found in unity. The call to "help them" aligns with the biblical principle of bearing one another's burdens, as expressed in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>.

In the first cited of these passages it has given rise to much discussion among those whose studies have been confined to the text of the English Bible, excluding even the margin. But its meaning is much debated among scholars. There seems no authority whatever for the translation <span class="accented">armed</span> or <span class="accented">harnessed.</span> We must either take it <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to mean <span class="accented">in five divisions</span>, the usual manner of marching under Moses (see <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.), "divided into centre, right and left wings, van and rear guard" (Ewald); or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">fierce, eager, brave</span>, from a Semitic root found also in the Arabic. So Rosenmuller and Gesenius - who does not, however, as Keil asserts, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to be fat, but from a root akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span> violence, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> to be pungent. The former refers to the parallel passage in <a href="/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, where for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> <span class="accented">quick.</span> The first interpretation is rendered probable by <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the order of march is described as a fivefold order, and by the similarity of the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> five, and is not excluded by <a href="/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>, where the army, though disorganised, may have still been arranged in its fivefold divisions. The fact that there is an Arabic word, almost precisely similar, which is applied to the fivefold division of an army, makes it almost certain that this is the true meaning. But some scholars prefer to render it "brave," or "eager for war" (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>). This last word is also found in the parallel passages in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. and <a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>. Its original meaning is <span class="accented">expeditus -</span> unencumbered. See note on the last-mentioned passage. All the mighty men of valour. The number of fighting men in these tribes would be, from a comparison of <a href="/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7, 18, 34</a>, remembering that <span class="accented">half</span> only of the tribe of Manasseh must be counted, between 110,000 and 111,000. But we read in <a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a> that 40,000 only of them went over. Above 70,000 must have remained behind to guard their women, children,and flocks, a precaution both reasonable and necessary. So indispensable, in fact, was it, that in this apparent discrepancy we may find one of the strongest proofs of the genuineness of our narrative. For, as Calvin remarks, in a country not yet pacified, all the women and children would infallibly have been massacred had they been left unprotected. <p> CHAPTER 1:16-18.
