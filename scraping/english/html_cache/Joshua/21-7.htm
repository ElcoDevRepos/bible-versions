The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities to dwell in. The Merarites were responsible for the care of the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, pillars, bases, and all its equipment (<a href="/numbers/3-36.htm">Numbers 3:36-37</a>). This division of labor among the Levites highlights the organized structure of Israelite worship and the importance of maintaining the tabernacle, which was central to Israel's religious life.<p><b>received twelve cities</b><br>The allocation of cities to the Levites fulfilled God's command to provide for the tribe that served in the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>). The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or the people of God, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.

Reuben and Gad settled east of the Jordan, while Zebulun was located in the northern part of Canaan.

This arrangement also fulfilled the promise that the Levites would have no inheritance of land but would be supported by the other tribes (<a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).
