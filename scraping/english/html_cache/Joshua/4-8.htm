Joshua, as Moses' successor, is a type of Christ, leading God's people into their inheritance. The Israelites' compliance reflects their trust in God's appointed leader, paralleling the call for Christians to follow Christ's commands.<p><b>They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan,</b><br>The twelve stones symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel, representing the unity and collective identity of God's people. The act of taking stones from the Jordan's middle signifies a miraculous event, as the river was parted for their crossing. This mirrors the Red Sea crossing, reinforcing God's power and faithfulness. The stones serve as a tangible reminder of God's deliverance and provision.<p><b>one for each tribe of Israel,</b><br>This emphasizes the equal representation and importance of each tribe in God's covenant community. It underscores the theme of unity among diversity within the body of believers. The twelve tribes are often seen as a precursor to the twelve apostles, who form the foundation of the Church.<p><b>just as the LORD had told Joshua;</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the command, highlighting Joshua's role as a faithful mediator of God's will. It reflects the importance of divine instruction and obedience in achieving God's purposes. The phrase also points to the prophetic nature of God's word, which is fulfilled through human action.<p><b>and they carried them to the camp,</b><br>The act of carrying the stones to the camp signifies the transition from a miraculous event to a memorial for future generations. The camp represents a place of rest and community, where the Israelites can reflect on God's faithfulness. This action parallels the Christian practice of remembering Christ's sacrifice through communion.<p><b>where they set them down.</b><br>Setting the stones down establishes a permanent memorial, serving as a witness to future generations of God's mighty acts. It is a call to remember and teach God's faithfulness, similar to how Christians are called to remember and proclaim the gospel.
