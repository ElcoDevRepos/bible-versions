This allocation was part of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land for his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Moses' role as a lawgiver and leader is a type of Christ, who also gives an inheritance to His people (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<p><b>to the clans</b><br>The division of land was done according to the clans or families within each tribe, ensuring that each family unit received its portion. This reflects the importance of family and community in Israelite society and the biblical principle of inheritance (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). It also underscores the orderly and fair distribution of God's blessings.<p><b>of the tribe of Reuben</b><br>Reuben was the firstborn son of Jacob and Leah (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>). Despite his birthright, Reuben lost his preeminence due to his sin against his father (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22, 49</a>:3-4). The tribe of Reuben settled on the east side of the Jordan, in the region of Gilead, which was suitable for their large flocks and herds (<a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). This location had strategic importance and was often a buffer zone against eastern invaders.<p><b>:</b><br>The colon here introduces the specific details of the land allocation that follows in the subsequent verses.

It functions as a hinge verse, linking Moses&#8217; earlier actions east of the Jordan to Joshua&#8217;s present record west of the river (<a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses had given</b><p>&#8226;

It underscores grace: although Moses would not enter Canaan, his obedience secured a homeland for others, echoing <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a> where Moses is faithful &#8220;as a servant.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the clans</b><p>&#8226;

This passage is an expansion of <a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33-42</a>. We learn from it that the Israelites actually took possession of this land. But in the reigns of the wicked kings Omri and Ahab the power of Israel declined, and after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and the defeat and death of Ahab, the Moabites succeeded in shaking off the Israelitish yoke, and in wresting from Israel moreover a considerable portion of the territory of Sihon. In the next reign an attempt was made to regain possession of the lost territory. We learn from the Moabite stone that the important towns here mentioned, Medeba, Dibon, Baalmeon, Kiriathaim (or Kirjathalm, as it is here called), Ataroth, Nebo, Aroer, had fallen into the hands of Mesha at the rebellion, and that he had erected a citadel at Dibon, which had become his capital. Hence the endeavour to invade Moab from the south, recorded in <a href="/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a>, which, however, though successful as a military promenade, was attended with no permanent results. For Isaiah (ch. 15.)and Jeremiah (ch. 48.) mention most of these places, as well as Elealeh and Heshbon, the former capital of Sihon, as being strongholds of the Moabite power. Jahaz, too, the place where Sihon gave battle of the Israelites, is numbered by Mesha, as well as at a later date by Isaiah and Jeremiah, among the possessions of Moab; while Horonaim, mentioned among the Moabite cities by the two prophets, is incidentally noticed by Mesha as having been captured from the Edomites. In this early extinction of the tribe of Reuben we may see the fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">The plain by Medeba.</span> See ver. 10; so again in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[This is what] Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had given</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Reuben:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7205.htm">Strong's 7205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Reuben -- 'behold a son!' oldest son of Jacob, also his desc</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/13-15.htm">OT History: Joshua 13:15 Moses gave to the tribe of the (Josh.
