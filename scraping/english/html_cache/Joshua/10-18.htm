It also symbolizes the finality and inevitability of God's judgment against the enemies of Israel.<p><b>and post men there to guard them.</b><br>Posting guards ensures that the trapped kings cannot escape, highlighting the importance of vigilance and thoroughness in executing God's commands. This action reflects the broader biblical theme of watchfulness and the necessity of maintaining spiritual and physical readiness.
