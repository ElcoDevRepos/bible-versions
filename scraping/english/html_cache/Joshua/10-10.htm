The confusion of Israel's enemies is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God intervenes directly, such as the confusion of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>). This divine action underscores the belief that victory comes from God, not merely human effort. Theologically, it reflects God's sovereignty and His role as a warrior for His people, a theme echoed in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>.<p><b>who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant Canaanite city that had made a treaty with Israel (Joshua 9). The "great slaughter" indicates a decisive victory, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel. Historically, this battle demonstrates the strategic importance of Gibeon, which controlled access to the central hill country. Theologically, it serves as a testament to God's faithfulness in delivering His people and fulfilling His covenant promises.<p><b>pursued them along the ascent to Beth-horon</b><br>Beth-horon was a strategic pass leading from the coastal plain to the hill country. The pursuit along this ascent indicates a relentless follow-through by the Israelites, ensuring a comprehensive victory. This geographical detail highlights the tactical advantage gained by Israel and the thoroughness of their campaign. The ascent to Beth-horon is also mentioned in other biblical battles, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/13-18.htm">1 Samuel 13:18</a>, indicating its continued military significance.<p><b>and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah</b><br>Azekah and Makkedah were towns in the Shephelah, the lowland region of Judah. The mention of these locations marks the extent of the victory and the thoroughness of the Israelite campaign. Archaeological evidence suggests these were fortified cities, indicating the strength of the Canaanite defense. Theologically, the complete defeat of the enemy symbolizes the totality of God's deliverance and the establishment of Israel in the Promised Land. This victory prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over sin and death, as seen in the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate conqueror (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine being who intervenes on behalf of Israel, causing confusion among their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation led by Joshua, chosen by God to inherit the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A significant city where the battle takes place; the Gibeonites had previously made a treaty with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-horon.htm">Beth-horon</a></b><br>A strategic location on the route of the Israelite pursuit, known for its ascent and descent.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/azekah_and_makkedah.htm">Azekah and Makkedah</a></b><br>Locations marking the extent of the Israelite victory and pursuit of their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Recognize that God actively participates in the lives of His people, often in unexpected ways.

We may compare <a href="/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-27.htm" title="Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:">Numbers 21:27</a>, where reference is made to poetical passages either current among the people (as national ballads) or actually written. The name Jasher (upright) is not taken as the name of an author, and what it refers to no one knows. From the fact that all the passages cited in this way are more or less poetical, we may infer that there was a poetical literature among the Hebrews (partly written, partly unwritten) from which the inspired writers occasionally made extracts. The songs of Moses, including the ninetieth Psalm, belong to this literature. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Discomfited</span>. The original meaning of the word is to <span class="accented">disturb, put in motion.</span> Hence, as here, to <span class="accented">throw into con. fusion, put to rout. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Going up to Beth-horon.</span> Beth-horon, or the house of the hollow, consisted of two towns. The one is now called Belt Ur el Foka, or Upper Belt Ur, the other Belt Ur el Tachta, or Lower Beit Ur. To the former led a difficult pass from Gibeon, called the ascent <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) to Beth-horon. From the former to the latter ran a path so rocky and rugged that steps have been made in the rock to facilitate the descent. This is the "going down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) to Beth-horon, mentioned in the next verse. So Maccabees 3:16-24. (Cf. Robinson, vol. 3. see. 9). Speaking of the view from Beth-horon, he says, The prospect included the hill country and the plain as far as the eye could reach .... Upon the side of the long hill that skirts the valley on the south, we could perceive a small village on the W.S.W. called Yalo." To Azekah. See <a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. This place is known to after Jewish history, having been fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>), besieged by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>), which shows it to have been a place of some importance. It continued to be inhabited after the captivity (<a href="/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), and has been identified by Vandevelde with Ahbek, a place standing upon a mountain. He supposes it to have been identical with the Aphek in Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). But this would be better identified with Aphekah (<a href="/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>). Lieut. Conder ('Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper,' Oct., 1875) identifies it with a place called Deir el Aashek, eight miles north of Shochoh. But apparently in the 'Handbook' he has abandoned this idea, though he makes no reference to this passage. And unto Makkedah. One of the lowland cities of Judah (see <a href="/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>). Vandevelde identifies it with Summeil, a place where there are the ruins of a very ancient city (see ver. 28), built of large uncemented stones, a sign of great antiquity, and a large cave, such as that described in ver. 16. See Robinson, vol. 2. p. 368, who gives not a hint, however, that it is to be identified with Makkedah, nor does he mention a cave. Lieut. Conder ('Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper,' July, 1875) identifies it with the present E1 Moghar (The Caves), twenty-five miles from Gibeon along the valley of Ajalon, where several caves are found, the only ones, apparently, in the district. Summeil is a very long distance from Gibeon, and if we are to identify this with Makkedah, which there appears no ground for doing, supernatural assistance would have been required in more than one way for so protracted a pursuit during the same day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">threw them into confusion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1467;&#1502;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;hum&#183;m&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
