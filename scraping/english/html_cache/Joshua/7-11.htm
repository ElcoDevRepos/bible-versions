In the context of <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, the sin of Achan is seen as affecting the entire nation. This reflects the communal nature of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the actions of one can impact the whole. This concept is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, where Paul warns that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, emphasizing the impact of individual sin on the community.<p><b>they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them,</b><br>The covenant referred to here is the Mosaic Covenant, which includes the laws and commandments given to Israel at Mount Sinai. Transgressing the covenant means breaking the agreement and disobeying God's commands. This breach of covenant is a serious offense, as it signifies a rejection of God's authority and provision. The covenant relationship is central to Israel's identity and mission, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to the covenant.<p><b>and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction.</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which involves dedicating something to God, often through complete destruction, as an act of judgment and purification. In the context of the conquest of Canaan, certain items and people were to be destroyed as a means of purging idolatry and sin from the land. Achan's taking of these items was a direct violation of God's command, as seen in <a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18-19</a>, where the Israelites were warned not to take any of the devoted things.<p><b>Indeed, they have stolen and lied,</b><br>This phrase highlights the specific sins of theft and deceit. Achan's actions involved not only taking what was forbidden but also concealing his sin from the community and from God. This deceit is reminiscent of the sin of Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>, where lying to the Holy Spirit resulted in severe consequences. The emphasis on honesty and integrity is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, which states that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.<p><b>and they have put these things with their own possessions.</b><br>By placing the devoted items among their own possessions, Achan attempted to integrate sin into his life without consequence. This act of hiding sin is a common human tendency, yet it is futile before an omniscient God. The concealment of sin is addressed in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>, which speaks of God's inescapable presence. This phrase also serves as a warning against the dangers of covetousness and materialism, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, where the love of money is described as the root of all kinds of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The collective nation of God's chosen people, who have entered the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership. In this context, Israel is held accountable for the sin of one individual, Achan, highlighting the communal nature of sin and responsibility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land. He is responsible for addressing the sin within the camp and restoring the covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/achan.htm">Achan</a></b><br>An Israelite from the tribe of Judah who disobeyed God's command by taking devoted items from Jericho, leading to Israel's defeat at Ai. His actions serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>A city in Canaan where Israel faced unexpected defeat due to Achan's sin. This event underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands for victory and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devoted_things.htm">The Devoted Things</a></b><br>Items that were to be destroyed or dedicated to the Lord as part of the conquest of Jericho.

Taking the devoted things was theft against God, and concealing them compounded the sin with deceit. The verse warns that hidden sin corrupts the whole community, underscores the seriousness of treating the holy as common, and calls God&#8217;s people to wholehearted obedience, transparent repentance, and reverent stewardship of all entrusted to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">They have also transgressed my covenant.</span>--The law is again brought prominently forward in this scene. "The words of the covenant, the ten commandments," are first of all a pledge that Jehovah is the God of Israel. "I am Jehovah, thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt." And He brought them out that He might bring them in--and He made them the executioners of His wrath against the idolaters. They must have no other gods but Him, and they must not treat the things that had been defiled by association with idolatry as their own spoil. The words which specially apply to this case are to be found in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/7-25.htm" title="The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a> : "The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not <span class= "ital">desire </span>(see <a href="/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>) the silver or gold that is on them. . . .
