Balaam, a prophet from Mesopotamia, was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel (Numbers 22-24). Despite Balaam's intentions, God did not allow him to curse His people. This demonstrates God's sovereignty and His protective nature over Israel. It also highlights the theme of divine will prevailing over human intentions, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph acknowledges God's plan in his life despite his brothers' actions.<p><b>So he blessed you again and again,</b><br>Instead of cursing Israel, Balaam ended up blessing them multiple times. This is a testament to God's power to turn intended curses into blessings, a theme echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-5.htm">Deuteronomy 23:5</a>. The blessings pronounced by Balaam include prophecies about Israel's future prosperity and dominance, which align with God's covenant promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). This also prefigures the ultimate blessing through Jesus Christ, who transforms the curse of sin into the blessing of salvation (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13-14</a>).<p><b>and I delivered you from his hand.</b><br>God's deliverance from Balaam's hand signifies His active role in protecting Israel from spiritual and physical threats. This deliverance is part of a larger narrative of God's faithfulness in leading Israel from Egypt to the Promised Land. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a deliverer, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>, where He delivers Israel from the Egyptians. This deliverance foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who saves humanity from sin and death (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.
