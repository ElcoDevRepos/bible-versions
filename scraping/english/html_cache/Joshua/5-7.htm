The previous generation, who had been delivered from Egypt, perished in the desert due to their disobedience and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-33</a>). This new generation represents a fresh start and a fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people into the Promised Land. The raising up of sons signifies God's faithfulness in continuing His covenant with Israel despite the failures of their ancestors.<p><b>and these were the ones Joshua circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). It was a physical mark of belonging to God's chosen people. The act of circumcising this new generation under Joshua's leadership was a renewal of the covenant and a preparation for entering the Promised Land. It symbolized a spiritual cleansing and commitment to God, aligning with the theme of consecration before taking possession of Canaan.<p><b>Until this time they were still uncircumcised</b><br>This indicates that during the 40 years of wandering, the practice of circumcision had been neglected. The wilderness period was a time of testing and discipline for Israel, and the lack of circumcision reflects a break in the covenantal practice. This neglect underscores the need for renewal and obedience as the Israelites prepare to enter a new phase of their journey with God.<p><b>since they had not been circumcised along the way</b><br>The phrase highlights the practical challenges faced during the nomadic life in the wilderness, which may have contributed to the neglect of circumcision. It also emphasizes the transitional nature of Israel's journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land. The act of circumcision at this point marks a significant turning point, as the Israelites are about to claim their inheritance. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of adhering to His commands as they move forward.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.
