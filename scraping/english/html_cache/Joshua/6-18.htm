In the context of ancient warfare, "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) meant that certain items were to be completely destroyed or given to God, signifying total consecration. This command underscores the holiness of God and the need for Israel to remain pure and obedient. The concept of herem is seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, where God commands Israel to destroy the Canaanite nations completely. This reflects the seriousness of sin and the need for separation from anything that could lead to idolatry or moral corruption.<p><b>lest you yourself be set apart for destruction</b><br>This warning highlights the consequences of disobedience. If the Israelites took any of the devoted items, they would themselves become subject to the same destruction intended for Jericho. This reflects the principle of divine justice and the seriousness of covenant faithfulness. The idea of being "set apart" for destruction is a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin, as seen in the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, who disobeyed this command and brought judgment upon himself and Israel.<p><b>If you take any of these</b><br>The conditional "if" indicates the potential for disobedience and the human tendency to covet. This serves as a test of Israel's faithfulness and trust in God's provision. The temptation to take spoils of war was strong, but obedience required trust in God's plan and provision. This echoes the temptation in the Garden of Eden, where taking what was forbidden led to sin and separation from God.<p><b>you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the communal nature of sin and its consequences. One person's disobedience could bring judgment upon the entire community, highlighting the interconnectedness of the people of God. This principle is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, where Paul warns that a little leaven leavens the whole lump, illustrating how sin can affect the entire body of believers.<p><b>and bring disaster upon it</b><br>The disaster refers to the divine judgment that would follow disobedience. This serves as a warning of the serious consequences of sin and the importance of holiness among God's people. The disaster that befell Israel due to Achan's sin (Joshua 7) serves as a historical example of this principle. It underscores the need for vigilance and obedience in the life of faith, as well as the mercy and justice of God in dealing with sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>The first city in the Promised Land that the Israelites were commanded to conquer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are being led into the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ban.htm">The Ban (Herem)</a></b><br>The command to devote certain things to destruction, often as an act of divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_israel.htm">The Camp of Israel</a></b><br>The community of Israelites, which could be affected by individual disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_obedience.htm">The Seriousness of Obedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s commands are not to be taken lightly.

Similar warnings occur when God tells Adam and Eve not to eat the forbidden fruit (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) and when the Israelites are told not to gather manna on the seventh day (<a href="/exodus/16-25.htm">Exodus 16:25-28</a>). Obedience is an act of worship that shows trust in God&#8217;s wisdom. By setting certain items apart for judgment, the Lord makes a line Israel must not cross&#8212;reminding them He alone decides what is holy and what is unclean (<a href="/leviticus/10-10.htm">Leviticus 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lest you yourself be set apart for destruction</b><p>The same cherem (ban) that rests on Jericho&#8217;s goods will fall on anyone who takes them. Achan&#8217;s later sin (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-25</a>) proves this warning literal. This principle echoes God&#8217;s earlier words: &#8220;I the LORD your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Touching the banned items aligns a person with God&#8217;s enemies and places that person under identical judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If you take any of these</b><p>The condition is straightforward&#8212;personal choice brings personal consequence. The Lord often attaches &#8220;if&#8221; statements to covenant blessings and curses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2, 15</a>). Here, taking even one trinket is rebellion. Sin is not graded on size; it is defined by disobedience (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). God&#8217;s people cannot claim ignorance: Joshua has spoken plainly, and the record is public.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction</b><p>Sin doesn&#8217;t stay private. One man&#8217;s theft endangers everyone. Paul draws the same lesson when he warns that &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). The unity of God&#8217;s people means shared blessing&#8212;or shared discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a>). Community holiness matters because God dwells in the midst of His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>). Defilement drives out His presence and invites judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bring disaster upon it</b><p>The disaster is not hypothetical; it materializes at Ai when Israel loses thirty-six men (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>). When God&#8217;s protection lifts, even a small enemy can defeat His people. The pattern reappears throughout Judges when Israel&#8217;s idolatry brings oppression (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-15</a>). Conversely, repentance restores favor (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>). Disaster serves as both consequence and mercy&#8212;shaking the nation awake before greater ruin comes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18</a> underscores God&#8217;s absolute right to set boundaries, the seriousness of individual obedience, and the communal impact of personal sin. By refusing the devoted things, Israel would honor God&#8217;s holiness and enjoy His protection. By seizing them, they would invite the very destruction God intended for Jericho. The verse reminds believers today that holiness is non-negotiable, sin endangers the whole body, and obedience secures God&#8217;s blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Accursed thing.</span> Better," thing <span class="accented">devoted,"</span> as this keeps up the idea of something solemnly set apart to God, to be dealt with as He thinks fit. <span class="cmt_word">Lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing.</span> Rather, with Keil and Rosenmuller, <span class="accented">lest ye devote the city to destruction, and then take of what has been thus devoted.</span> And make the camp of Israel a curse.
