The number five may symbolize human weakness and incompleteness, contrasting with divine strength.<p><b>the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon</b><br>These cities were significant Canaanite strongholds. Jerusalem, later becoming Israel's capital, was a Jebusite city at this time. Hebron was historically significant as Abraham's dwelling place.

This alliance underscores the threat Israel faced and the strategic importance of these locations.<p><b>joined forces and advanced with all their armies</b><br>The coalition of these kings represents a united front against Israel, emphasizing the severity of the threat. This unity among the Amorite kings shows their desperation to resist Israel's advance, reflecting the broader spiritual battle against God's people.<p><b>They camped before Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon was a significant city that had made a treaty with Israel (Joshua 9). Its strategic location made it a target for the Amorite coalition. The encampment signifies preparation for battle, highlighting the imminent threat to Gibeon and, by extension, Israel.<p><b>and made war against it</b><br>This act of aggression against Gibeon was a direct challenge to Israel, as Gibeon was now under Israel's protection.

Their mobilization fulfills God&#8217;s earlier word that whole nations would resist Israel&#8217;s entry (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27&#8211;28</a>). The number five hints at a complete regional response, showing that the threat was formidable yet still firmly under God&#8217;s sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8212;the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon&#8212;</b><p>Joshua names the cities so readers grasp the geographic spread:<p>&#8226; Jerusalem, future capital of Israel (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebron, long-established and later given to Caleb (<a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, strongholds in the Shephelah lowlands (<a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a> - 39).<p>Listing them underscores that every important center in southern Canaan is represented. Rather than facing Israel one by one (as at Jericho and Ai), these rulers copy the strategy predicted in <a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1&#8211;2</a>&#8212;uniting against the advancing people of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>joined forces and advanced with all their armies</b><p>The five kings &#8220;joined forces&#8221; exactly as Adoni-Zedek of Jerusalem proposed (<a href="/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3&#8211;4</a>). They commit &#8220;all their armies,&#8221; illustrating total opposition&#8212;yet also concentrating their strength where God plans to break it. Similar massings of enemy power later appear in <a href="/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1&#8211;2</a>, each time paving the way for supernatural deliverance.

By camping &#8220;before&#8221; the city, the coalition announces siege intentions while daring Joshua to honor that covenant. The placement also shows practical savvy: Gibeon&#8217;s strategic hilltop location commanded the routes into the heart of Canaan (<a href="/jeremiah/41-12.htm">Jeremiah 41:12</a>). Their encampment thus threatens Israel&#8217;s newly acquired ally and attempts to block Israel&#8217;s forward momentum.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and made war against it.</b><p>The final phrase moves from posture to action. War begins, forcing Israel either to abandon its oath or rush to Gibeon&#8217;s aid.

The enemy&#8217;s aggression ultimately magnifies God&#8217;s power, echoing <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221; The coalition&#8217;s war becomes the stage on which God vindicates His people and His promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a> records the moment five Amorite kings unite, surround Gibeon, and launch war&#8212;an intimidating coalition that nevertheless sets the stage for one of Scripture&#8217;s most dramatic victories.
