This area was known for its diverse and powerful city-states, each ruled by its own king. The news that reached these kings was likely about the Israelites' victories at Jericho and Ai, which demonstrated the power and favor of the God of Israel. This caused fear among the Canaanite kings, as they realized the threat posed by the advancing Israelites.<p><b>those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon&#8212;</b><br>The "hill country" refers to the central mountainous region of Canaan, which includes areas like Hebron and Jerusalem. The "foothills" or "Shephelah" are the lowlands between the hill country and the coastal plains, known for their fertile land. The "coast of the Great Sea" refers to the Mediterranean coast, a region of strategic importance due to its trade routes. "Toward Lebanon" indicates the northern extent of the land, reaching up to the region known for its cedar forests. This geographical description highlights the vast and varied terrain that the Israelites were to conquer, emphasizing the challenge they faced.<p><b>the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites&#8212;</b><br>These groups represent the various peoples inhabiting Canaan. The Hittites were originally from Anatolia but had a presence in Canaan. The Amorites were a Semitic people known for their influence in Mesopotamia and Canaan. The Canaanites were the general inhabitants of the land, often associated with the Phoenicians. The Perizzites were likely a rural people living in the open country. The Hivites are thought to have lived in the northern regions, possibly near Shechem and Gibeon. The Jebusites inhabited Jerusalem, which was known as Jebus before its conquest by David. These peoples were known for their idolatrous practices, which the Israelites were commanded to avoid, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>. The mention of these groups underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as the need for the Israelites to remain faithful to God's commands amidst pagan influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_west_of_the_jordan.htm">Kings West of the Jordan</a></b><br>These are the rulers of various city-states in the region west of the Jordan River.
