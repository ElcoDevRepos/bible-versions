Its fortifications were formidable, with walls that were both high and thick, designed to withstand sieges. The phrase "tightly shut up" indicates a state of lockdown, reflecting the fear and anticipation of the Israelites' approach. This defensive posture underscores the city's awareness of Israel's recent victories and the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River, which had spread fear among the Canaanites.<p><b>because of the Israelites.</b><br>The Israelites, under Joshua's leadership, had recently crossed the Jordan River in a miraculous event reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing. This act demonstrated God's continued presence and power with Israel, instilling fear in the hearts of the Canaanite inhabitants. The reputation of the Israelites as a divinely supported people preceded them, causing cities like Jericho to take extreme defensive measures. This fear was not only due to their military prowess but also because of the divine interventions that accompanied them.<p><b>No one went out and no one came in.</b><br>This phrase highlights the complete lockdown of Jericho, a common ancient military strategy to prevent espionage and maintain internal security during a siege. The city's gates were closed, and movement was restricted to prevent any potential spies from entering or inhabitants from defecting. This situation sets the stage for the miraculous conquest that follows, where conventional military tactics are overturned by divine intervention. The impenetrable state of Jericho emphasizes the miraculous nature of its eventual fall, showcasing God's power and the fulfillment of His promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>An ancient city in the land of Canaan, known for its fortified walls.

The wording points to an intentional, total lockdown&#8212;every door locked, every entry sealed (cf. <a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14</a>). The city&#8217;s response mirrors later sieges such as Samaria&#8217;s barricading against the Arameans (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24</a>).

The verse sets the stage: a strong city, an anxious enemy, and a faithful Lord ready to prove that no wall is too tall, no gate too strong, for the people who trust His promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VI.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now Jericho . . .</span>--This verse should be read parenthetically, and <a href="/context/joshua/6-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.">Joshua 6:2-5</a> should be taken as the orders given to Joshua by the captain of the Lord's host.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse (see above) is parenthetical. It explains why the captain of the Lord's host appeared unto Joshua. The inhabitants of Jericho, though in a state of the utmost alarm, were nevertheless fully on their guard against the children of Israel. The commencement of hostilities imposed a great responsibility on Joshua. Success at the outset was, humanly speaking, indispensable. We may see what defeat involved for him by his distress in consequence of the check at Ai. The alternative was victory or annihilation, for the Israelites had no homes or fortresses to which they could retire. Joshua was therefore encouraged by a visible proof that he was under the protection of the Most High, to be yet farther assured by the marvels that were to follow. The use of the Pual participle with its fullest intensive sense, to strengthen the affirmation of the action by the Kal, is a singular construction. Literally rendered it is "shutting and closely shut up," thus including <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the act of closing, and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the continuance of that act, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (LXX.), "clausa at que munita" (Vulg.). So also the Chaldea paraphrase. The remainder of the verse strengthens still more the assertion of the state of siege. The king of Jericho, such was his alarm, regarded his city as a beleaguered one, from the mere presence of Joshua and his host in its vicinity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Jericho</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3405.htm">Strong's 3405: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jericho -- a city in the Jordan Valley captured by Joshua</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was tightly shut up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1465;&#1490;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;&#183;&#7713;e&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5462.htm">Strong's 5462: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shut up, to surrender</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mip&#183;p&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came in.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">OT History: Joshua 6:1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because (Josh.
