The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given cities within the territories of other tribes. The casting of lots was a common biblical method for making decisions, believed to reflect God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).

They were given a distinct honor and responsibility in Israel's religious life, serving as mediators between God and the people. The allocation of cities to the Aaronic priests from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin highlights the centrality of worship and the priesthood in Israel's life. Judah's prominence is significant, as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, the High Priest in the order of Melchizedek (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>), would come. The number thirteen may symbolize completeness or the full provision for the priestly duties.

Their receiving the first allotment highlights their central role in Israel&#8217;s worship (<a href="/numbers/4-2.htm">Numbers 4:2-15</a>).

In the camp of Israel there were two squares surrounding the tabernacle: an inner square of priests and Levites, an outer square of the tribes of Israel, three on each side. The inner square was arranged thus:--The priests, with Moses and Aaron, on the east, by the entrance of the tabernacle; the Kohathites on the south, the Gershonites on the west, and the Merarites on the north. On the march the priests were the chief officers of this portion of the army. The Kohathites carried the sacred vessels, the Gershonites the curtains and various fabrics of the tent and tabernacle, and the Merarites the bars and boards. When they received their inheritances in Palestine, the same relative order was preserved.<p><span class= "bld">INHERITANCE OF THE PRIESTS </span>(<a href="/context/joshua/21-9.htm" title="And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.">Joshua 21:9-19</a>).<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Out of the tribe of . . . Judah . . . and Simeon; and (17) out of the tribe of Benjamin.</span>--It is worthy of notice that, with the exception of a single city in the tribe of Simeon (viz., Ain, <a href="/joshua/21-16.htm" title="And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.">Joshua 21:16</a>), <span class= "ital">all the priestly cities are so arranged as to fall ultimately within the kingdom of Judah, </span>of which the capital was Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. The Levites also left their cities and their suburbs in the reign of Jeroboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-14.htm" title="For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD:">2Chronicles 11:14</a>), and came over <span class= "ital">to </span>Judah. But the fact that all the priests, with the trifling exception noted above, were already settled in that kingdom, must have been a great attraction.<p>When these facts are observed, it is hardly possible not to be struck with the undesigned agreement between the Book of Joshua and the later history, as well as with the Divine foresight which arranged the distribution of the people thus.<p>(13) <span class= "bld">Hebron</span> (<span class= "ital">El Khalil</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(14) <span class= "bld">Jattir</span> (<span class= "ital">Attir</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the lot came out.</span> As in the distribution of the land among the tribes, so in the division of the cities among the tribes of Levi, the whole matter was referred to the judgment of God. Thus solemnly placed in His hands, the division would not afterwards become the occasion of jealousy or dispute. The division was first made between the descendants of the three sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (see <a href="/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-25</a>), and then, as regards the Kohathites, between the priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the rest of the Levites. We have remarked above (<a href="/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>) on the disinterestedness of Joshua. We have now to remark on the same characteristic as displayed by Moses. There was no attempt on the part of Moses to "found a family," the object of ambition with most men, whether kings or private persons possessed of wealth. No special privileges belonged to his descendants. They merged in the undistinguished herd of the Levites generally. In this Moses contrasts favourably with most public men in our own day; he stands out prominently before nearly all the great leaders and conquerors before or even after the Christian era. The same may be said of Joshua, his successor. Cincinnatus may be in some measure compared with them, but as a dictator simply in time of danger, his power was by no means so absolute, nor were his temptations so great as those of the two successive leaders of the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Thirteen cities.</span> It has been contended by Maurer and others that this number of cities was largely in excess of what could possibly be required for the descendants of Aaron in so short a time. But we have to consider <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the cities were probably not, at least at first, inhabited exclusively by the priests; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Israelites multiplied rapidly, and that the number of descendants in the fourth generation would probably be nearly a thousand, and in the fifth, above five thousand; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that all the cities were not, as yet, actually taken from the Canaanites at all, and so therefore were in all probability only intended as an eventual possession of the priests, and  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The [first] lot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
