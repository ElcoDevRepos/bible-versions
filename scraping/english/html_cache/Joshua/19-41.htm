The concept of inheritance is significant in biblical theology, symbolizing God's promise and faithfulness to His people. The land was a tangible representation of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it was meant to be a perpetual possession for the Israelites. This inheritance also foreshadows the spiritual inheritance believers receive through Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>.<p><b>included Zorah</b><br>Zorah is a town located in the Shephelah region of Judah, near the border with the tribe of Dan. It is historically significant as the birthplace of Samson, one of the judges of Israel (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2</a>). Zorah's location on the border highlights the challenges the tribe of Dan faced in securing their territory, as they were often in conflict with the Philistines. The town's mention here underscores the ongoing struggle for the Israelites to fully possess the land God had given them.<p><b>Eshtaol</b><br>Eshtaol is another town in the territory of Dan, closely associated with Zorah. It is also linked to the story of Samson, as it was one of the places where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>). The proximity of Eshtaol to Zorah suggests a shared cultural and historical context, with both towns playing a role in the narrative of Israel's judges. The mention of Eshtaol emphasizes the importance of local communities in the unfolding of God's plan for His people.<p><b>Ir-shemesh</b><br>Ir-shemesh, meaning "city of the sun," is identified with Beth-shemesh, a town on the border of Judah and Dan. It was a Levitical city, indicating its religious significance (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>). The name suggests a possible Canaanite influence, as sun worship was common in the region. However, its inclusion in the Israelite inheritance signifies the transformation of the land from pagan practices to the worship of Yahweh. The town's history includes the return of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12-15</a>), highlighting its role in Israel's religious life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zorah.htm">Zorah</a></b><br>A town allocated to the tribe of Dan, located in the Shephelah region of Judah.

young Samson &#8220;between Zorah and Eshtaol,&#8221; tying both towns to the theme of divine empowerment (<a href="/judges/13-25.htm">Judges 13:25</a>).<p>- When five Danite spies set out from Eshtaol and Zorah to search for a more easily conquered homeland (<a href="/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2, 8, 11</a>), the episode exposed the tribe&#8217;s struggle to trust God&#8217;s promise within their own borders&#8212;yet the Lord&#8217;s allotment, affirmed here in <a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>, proves that He had already given them what they needed.<p>- Eshtaol thus calls readers to embrace God&#8217;s assignments rather than abandon them for seemingly easier paths.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ir-shemesh</b><p>- Third on the list, Ir-shemesh lay deeper in the Shephelah, the rolling foothills between the coastal plain and Judah&#8217;s highlands (also noted in <a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>).<p>- The town later appears as Beth-shemesh, a place where priests rejoiced to see the ark return from Philistine territory (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12&#8211;15</a>). That moment shows God&#8217;s holiness and mercy intersecting&#8212;a truth anchored in the land allotments He established centuries earlier.<p>- Ir-shemesh&#8217;s position along a strategic valley road meant that Dan could influence trade and defense if they trusted the Lord to secure their borders (<a href="/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>).<p>- By mentioning the town here, Joshua reminds his readers that every portion of the inheritance, from prominent sites to quieter villages, mattered to God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> records Zorah, Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh to assure us that Dan&#8217;s portion was real, specific, and sufficient. Each town highlights a facet of God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;clear borders, empowering presence, and strategic provision. The verse encourages believers to value every detail of God&#8217;s assignments and to step into them with confidence, knowing that the Lord who distributes the inheritance also supplies the strength to possess it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">And the coast . . .</span>--Zorah and Eshtaol, in the tribe of Dan, had been originally assigned to Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-33.htm" title="And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,">Joshua 15:33</a>); so also Ekron. But it is not clear whether they are mentioned here as marking the border of Dan and Judah, or actually in the territory of the former. However, Dan is wedged in, as it were, between the powerful tribes of Judah and Ephraim, the unconquered Philistines, and the sea. It is not surprising that their coast <span class= "ital">"</span>went out from them" (<a href="/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a>) when it was partly unconquered, partly taken from other tribes in the first instance.
