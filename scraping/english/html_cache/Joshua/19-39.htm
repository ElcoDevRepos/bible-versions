Naphtali, one of the sons of Jacob and Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, was the sixth son of Jacob. The inheritance signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land. The territory of Naphtali was located in the northern part of Israel, a region known for its fertile land and strategic location. This area later became significant in the New Testament, as it included regions where Jesus conducted much of His ministry, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about a great light shining in Galilee (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>).<p><b>including these cities and their villages</b><br>The specific cities and villages within Naphtali's inheritance are detailed earlier in the chapter. These cities were not only residential areas but also centers of trade, culture, and worship. The mention of cities and villages highlights the organized settlement and the importance of community life in ancient Israel. Archaeological findings in this region, such as those at Hazor, provide insights into the Canaanite and later Israelite occupation, revealing a blend of cultures and influences. The cities served as administrative and military centers, crucial for maintaining control over the territory. The distribution of cities and villages also reflects the tribal system's emphasis on family and clan structures, ensuring that each clan had its own space within the larger tribal inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and the second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.

all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession&#8221;).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a> the land is distributed &#8220;by lot, as the LORD had commanded,&#8221; underscoring that this allotment is neither random nor merely political but divinely directed.<p>&#8226; Every allotment in Joshua reinforces that the Lord keeps His Word literally; centuries earlier He spoke of specific borders (<a href="/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-12</a>), and now He hands them over in concrete, geographical reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the clans</b><p>&#8226; Israel was organized by extended families, so each clan received a portion within the tribal allotment (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>).<p>&#8226; This prevented land monopolies and preserved family heritage, echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>, &#8220;Do not move your neighbor&#8217;s boundary stone, set up by your predecessors,&#8221; safeguarding God-given boundaries.<p>&#8226; It also ensured every household experienced God&#8217;s promise firsthand, rather than viewing it as a distant tribal asset.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the tribe of Naphtali</b><p>&#8226;

Moses later prophesied, <a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>, &#8220;O Naphtali, satisfied with favor and full of the LORD&#8217;s blessing; take possession to the west and south,&#8221; language precisely echoed by the territory&#8217;s boundaries in <a href="/joshua/19-34.htm">Joshua 19:34-36</a>.<p>&#8226; This region would host decisive moments: Barak and Deborah summoned Naphtali against Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>); centuries later <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> foretold Messianic light dawning &#8220;in the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,&#8221; fulfilled when Jesus ministered in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226;

<a href="/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a> where Levites also served within Naphtali).<p>&#8226; The phrase signals completeness: the people receive not just territory but functioning communities&#8212;fields, pastures, infrastructure&#8212;so they can immediately live out covenant life (<a href="/leviticus/25-18.htm">Leviticus 25:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226;

He fulfills centuries-old promises by handing Naphtali a real inheritance, parcelled clan by clan, encompassing bustling cities and quiet villages. That same fidelity undergirds later acts of deliverance and ultimately prepares the very ground where the Messiah will shine His light. The verse is a quiet yet powerful reminder that every promise of God comes to pass&#8212;down to the last boundary stone and village lane&#8212;inviting us to trust Him for our own promised inheritance in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali</span>. Of Naphtali, Beyond the not too heroic leader Barak, we hear nothing in the after history of Israel, until the fulfilment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1, 2</a>. Galilee, the scene of the greater part of our Lord's teaching and miracles, was divided between Issachar, Asher, Zebulon, and Naphtali. The majority of the places mentioned in the Gospels were Within the borders of Zebulon. But as we learn that our Lord penetrated as far as "the coasts of Caesarea Philippi," in the extreme north of Palestine, He must have preached also in the cities of Naphtali. Naphtali sent a goodly number of warriors to welcome David as "king over all Israel" (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-34.htm">1 Chronicles 12:34</a>). The inheritance of Naphtali was in the main fertile, but there was a large mountain district, known as the mountain region of Naphtali (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). Some of the mountains rose to the height of more than 3,000 feet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was the inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5159.htm">Strong's 5159: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something inherited, occupancy, an heirloom, an estate, patrimony, portion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Naphtali,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;t&#257;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5321.htm">Strong's 5321: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naphtali -- a son of Jacob, also his descendants and the district settled by them</span><br /><br /><span class="word">including the cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and villages.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7779;&#183;r&#234;&#183;hen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2691.htm">Strong's 2691: </a> </span><span class="str2">A yard, a hamlet</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/19-39.htm">Joshua 19:39 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/19-39.htm">OT History: Joshua 19:39 This is the inheritance of the tribe (Josh.
