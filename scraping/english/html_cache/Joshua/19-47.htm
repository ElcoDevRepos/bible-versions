However, due to their inability to fully conquer and hold this territory, they faced pressure from surrounding peoples. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of Israel's struggle to fully possess the land due to incomplete obedience to God's commands. The loss of territory highlights the consequences of failing to drive out the inhabitants as instructed in earlier passages.<p><b>they went up and fought against Leshem</b><br>Leshem, also known as Laish, was a city located in the northern part of Canaan, near the sources of the Jordan River. The Danites' decision to move northward and attack Leshem indicates their search for a more secure and defensible location. This action is detailed further in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>, where the Danites send spies to explore the land and eventually decide to conquer Leshem. The phrase "went up" suggests a journey from a lower to a higher elevation, typical of the topography in Israel.<p><b>captured it, and put it to the sword</b><br>The capture and destruction of Leshem by the Danites involved a complete military conquest, as indicated by the phrase "put it to the sword." This was a common practice in ancient warfare, often involving the killing of the inhabitants and the destruction of the city. The conquest of Leshem is reminiscent of earlier Israelite conquests in Canaan, where cities were devoted to destruction as part of God's judgment on the Canaanite peoples.<p><b>So they took possession of Leshem, settled there</b><br>After capturing Leshem, the Danites took possession of the city and settled there, establishing it as their new tribal inheritance. This relocation reflects the adaptability and resilience of the tribe in seeking a place where they could thrive. The settlement of Leshem by the Danites fulfilled their need for a secure homeland, albeit outside their original allotment.<p><b>and renamed it after their father Dan</b><br>Renaming Leshem to Dan signifies the tribe's assertion of identity and heritage. Naming places after ancestors was a common practice in the ancient Near East, serving to establish a connection with the past and assert ownership. The name Dan, meaning "judge," is significant in the biblical narrative, as it reflects the role of the tribe in Israel's history. This renaming also connects to the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s people establishing their identity in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/danites.htm">Danites</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the son of Jacob and Bilhah.

The verse affirms the literal unfolding of Israel&#8217;s tribal history, shows the consequences of incomplete obedience, and displays God&#8217;s patience in allowing His people a fresh start when they finally act in faith. While the Danites secured a new homeland, later events warn that true security rests not merely in possessing land but in steadfast devotion to the Lord who grants it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them.</span>--The words "too<p>little" are not in the original; and it seems better to translate literally: <span class= "ital">And the coast of the children of Dan went out from them</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>their territory was partly re-conquered by the Philistines. Something similar seems to have occurred in several districts of the country. The Israelites not taking advantage of the impression produced by Joshua's great victories to occupy the territory assigned to them, the nations of Canaan re-possessed themselves of their former abodes. and held them against Israel. The Philistines are expressly said to have been left to prove Israel. Joshua was not permitted to exterminate them. And although Dan and Judah, numerically the two strongest of all the tribes (both in the census in the plains of Moab and at Sinai), were placed next to the Philistines, and had the task of conquering that nation assigned to them, still it was not effected. We read in Judges 1, <span class= "ital">"</span>The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley."<p>Hence the Danites, instead of attacking the Philistines and Amorites in their inheritance, preferred to form a new settlement in the north, and put to the sword "a people quiet and secure," who "had no deliverer," rather than "run with patience the race set before them." They were not minded to resist unto blood, striving against their foes. (See the narrative in Judges 18, especially <a href="/context/joshua/19-27.htm" title="And turns toward the sun rise to Bethdagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand,">Joshua 19:27-28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went out too little for them.</span> The Hebrew is, went out <span class="accented">from them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either went out beyond their own borders, or went out too small a distance to be sufficient for them. The first is the explanation of Masius ("extra se migrasse"), the second of Jarchi. Houbigant suggests for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> "and it went out" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;</span> "and it was narrow." But the LXX, has the same reading as ourselves, and the explanation given above is quite consistent with the fact. The border of Dan did "go out" far beyond the borders originally assigned to the tribe, in fact to the extreme northern limit of Palestine. The account of the taking of Laish, or Leshem, is given more fully in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.
