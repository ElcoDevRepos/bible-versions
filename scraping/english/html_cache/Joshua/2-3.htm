Jericho was a fortified city, one of the oldest known in history, strategically located near the Jordan River. The king's awareness of the spies indicates a well-organized intelligence network. Rahab, a resident of Jericho, is significant as she is later mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) and praised for her faith in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>. Her inclusion in the biblical narrative highlights God's grace and the theme of redemption.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house,</b><br>The king's command to Rahab underscores the seriousness of the threat perceived by the Canaanites. The spies' entry into Rahab's house, a place likely known for lodging, suggests a strategic choice for gathering intelligence while maintaining a low profile. This phrase also foreshadows Rahab's pivotal decision to protect the spies, aligning herself with the God of Israel rather than her own people, which is a profound act of faith and courage.<p><b>for they have come to spy out the whole land.&#8221;</b><br>The mission of the spies was to gather information about the land of Canaan, particularly Jericho, as part of Israel's preparation to enter the Promised Land. This reconnaissance mission is reminiscent of the earlier spying mission in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, where Moses sent twelve spies. The phrase highlights the strategic importance of Jericho as a gateway to Canaan. Theologically, this mission signifies God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The spies' task also prefigures the ultimate victory and inheritance of believers through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_jericho.htm">The King of Jericho</a></b><br>The ruler of the city of Jericho, a Canaanite city-state.

Kings were expected to protect their people, so he acts decisively&#8212;much like Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15&#8211;16</a> when he felt threatened by Israel&#8217;s growth.<p>&#8226; His reaching out to a citizen rather than raid the house himself shows both urgency and caution, echoing the measured approach of Saul when he gathered intelligence before moving against David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-7.htm">1 Samuel 23:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand is already seen: news reaches the king, yet the spies are still safe. <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Bring out the men who came to you&#8221;</b><p>The command is terse&#8212;no negotiation, no courtesy.<p>&#8226;

<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> urges believers, &#8220;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers,&#8221; a principle Rahab lives out centuries earlier.<p>&#8226; Her home, located on the city wall (<a href="/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>), becomes a literal and symbolic doorway from judgment to deliverance&#8212;foreshadowing the believer&#8217;s household of faith (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8230;for they have come to spy out the whole land.&#8221;</b><p>The king correctly perceives Israel&#8217;s intent yet misses the larger divine strategy.<p>&#8226; Forty years before, Moses sent twelve spies with the same mission (<a href="/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17&#8211;20</a>). This second reconnaissance signals that God&#8217;s promise is about to be fulfilled (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.htm">Deuteronomy 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jericho&#8217;s fear shows that the reputation of Israel&#8217;s God has gone before them; Rahab soon affirms, &#8220;All who live in the land are melting in fear of you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a> reminds us that every kingdom will ultimately yield: &#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/2-3.htm">Joshua 2:3</a> captures a pivotal clash of earthly authority and divine purpose.
