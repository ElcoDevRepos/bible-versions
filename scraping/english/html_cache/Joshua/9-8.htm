In the ancient Near Eastern context, declaring oneself as a servant was a common way to express submission and seek protection or alliance. The Gibeonites' strategy was to avoid the fate of other Canaanite cities that were being conquered by Israel. This act of deception highlights the fear and recognition of Israel's God-given power among the surrounding nations. The Gibeonites' submission can be seen as a type of the Gentiles coming to Christ, acknowledging His authority and seeking peace.<p><b>Then Joshua asked them,</b><br>Joshua's response shows his leadership and discernment in questioning the motives and origins of those who approached him. This reflects a common biblical theme where leaders are called to test the spirits and discern truth from deception. Joshua's inquiry is reminiscent of the need for spiritual vigilance, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>, which advises believers to test the spirits to see whether they are from God.<p><b>&#8220;Who are you and where have you come from?&#8221;</b><br>Joshua's questions aim to uncover the true identity and intentions of the Gibeonites. This reflects the importance of understanding the background and motives of those who seek to join or align with God's people. The question of origin is significant in the biblical narrative, as it often determines one's relationship with Israel and, by extension, with God. This inquiry can be paralleled with the call for believers to examine the foundations of their faith and the influences they allow into their lives. The Gibeonites' response to these questions would ultimately reveal their deceit, yet their eventual integration into Israel serves as a reminder of God's grace and the inclusion of outsiders into His covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.

Throughout Scripture, declaring oneself a servant signals acknowledgment of higher authority (<a href="/genesis/32-4.htm">Genesis 32:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/9-6.htm">2 Samuel 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Their words echo what nations were to do when suing for peace under Israel&#8217;s God-given mandate (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet, as the narrative later shows, their claim masks deception (<a href="/joshua/9-22.htm">Joshua 9:22-23</a>), reminding us that outward humility can coexist with hidden motives&#8212;something <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24-26</a> warns about.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;they said to Joshua&#8221;</b><p>Joshua stands as covenant leader, responsible for Israel&#8217;s decisions.<p>&#8226; God had charged him to &#8220;be strong and courageous&#8221; and keep the Law front-and-center (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Every plea brought to Joshua therefore touches Israel&#8217;s covenant identity (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Moses before him (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-16</a>), Joshua carries the weight of discerning truth from strangers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Then Joshua asked them&#8221;</b><p>Joshua does interrogate&#8212;but he stops short of first seeking the LORD (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly stresses that leadership must consult God before covenanting (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The pause that Joshua takes to question shows initial prudence, yet his failure to pray illustrates <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>&#8212;leaning on understanding without full dependence on the LORD can mislead.<p>&#8226; This tension underscores <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>: wisdom is promised when sought from above.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who are you and where have you come from?&#8221;</b><p>Identity and origin determine whether Israel may enter covenant; God forbade alliances with Canaanite peoples (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s double inquiry mirrors later biblical calls to &#8220;test the spirits&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>) and to be wary of unequal yokes (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The question reveals how covenant community must guard its purity (<a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) while still displaying God&#8217;s mercy when appropriate (<a href="/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Sadly, the Gibeonites&#8217; vague answer exploits this concern, proving the need for discernment that goes beyond surface words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-8.htm">Joshua 9:8</a> records a pivotal exchange: outsiders claim servanthood, Joshua probes their identity, and Israel teeters between obedience and compromise. The passage highlights genuine humility versus calculated flattery, leadership&#8217;s duty to seek God before binding agreements, and the perpetual call to safeguard covenant integrity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are thy servants.</span> This does not mean altogether, as ver. 9 shows, that the Gibeonites intended by this embassy to reduce themselves to servitude. Their object, as Grotius remarks, was rather to form an alliance on terms of something like equality. The phrase was one common in the East as a token of respect (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/genesis/32-4.htm">Genesis 32:4, 18</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-18.htm">Genesis 50:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>). But no doubt the Gibeonites (see ver. 11) expected to have a tribute laid on them. And they would willingly accept such an impost, for, as Ewald remarks ( 'History of Israel,' 4:3), their object was "to secure the peace which a mercantile inland city especially requires" (see also note on Joshua 3:10). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come ye?</span> Joshua uses the imperfect, not the perfect, tense here. Commentators are divided about its meaning. Some suppose that the perfect, "from whence have ye come?" is mere direct and abrupt than "from whence may you have come?" or, "from whence were you coming?" and certainly an indirect question is in most languages considered more respectful than a direct one (see <a href="/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7</a>). But perhaps with Ewald we may regard it simply as implying that their mission was still in progress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;We</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_587.htm">Strong's 587: </a> </span><span class="str2">We</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are your servants,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1443;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
