This area is significant in biblical history as a boundary marker for the lands conquered by the Israelites. The Sea of Chinnereth, known today as the Sea of Galilee, is a freshwater lake in northern Israel. It is a central location in the ministry of Jesus, where He performed many miracles. The Arabah's mention highlights the vastness of the territory under Israelite control, emphasizing God's promise to Abraham regarding the land.<p><b>to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea)</b><br>The Sea of the Arabah, also known as the Salt Sea or the Dead Sea, is the lowest point on Earth's surface. Its high salinity prevents most life forms from thriving, symbolizing desolation and judgment. In biblical prophecy, the transformation of the Dead Sea into fresh water is a sign of restoration and blessing (<a href="/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8-9</a>). The reference to this sea underscores the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, as the land extends to this significant geographical landmark.<p><b>eastward through Beth-jeshimoth</b><br>Beth-jeshimoth, meaning "house of the deserts," was a town located east of the Jordan River, near the northern end of the Dead Sea. It served as a boundary marker for the territory of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>). The location's name reflects the arid conditions of the region. This area was part of the land allotted to the tribes of Israel, demonstrating the detailed fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<p><b>and southward below the slopes of Pisgah</b><br>Pisgah is a mountain range in Moab, from which Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death (<a href="/deuteronomy/34.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>). The slopes of Pisgah are significant as they represent the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the inheritance of the Promised Land. This area is associated with divine revelation and the fulfillment of God's promises, as Moses received a glimpse of the land that Israel would possess. The mention of Pisgah highlights the continuity of God's plan from Moses to Joshua, as the Israelites move forward to claim their inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arabah.htm">Arabah</a></b><br>A desert region that extends from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea.

So also below. <span class="cmt_word">The way to Beth-jeshimoth</span> (see <a href="/numbers/33-48.htm">Numbers 33:48, 49</a>). There was a desert tract near the Dead Sea called Jeshimon, or the waste district. It is described by travellers as the most arid portion of the whole land. In this, Beth-jeshimoth (the house of desolations) was situated. It was south of the acacia meadows (see note on Joshua 2:1), and it formed part of the territory of Reuben (<a href="/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>). As it lay upon Jordan, it must have been near the extreme northernmost point of the Dead Sea. We are to understand, not that Sihon's territory extended to Beth-jeshimoth, but in that direction. Possibly some of the western Cauaanitish tribes here extended their territories across the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">And from the south.</span> The word here is not Negeb, but Teman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the literal south, which lay on the right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) to one looking eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdoth-pisgah.</span> For Ashdoth see <a href="/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>. Pisgah was the northernmost point of the Abarim range, of which the well known Nebo was the chief peak. Thither Moses went up to view the land which he was not permitted to enter. There Balaam built his seven altars and essayed in vain to curse the children of Israel. There were the watchmen (Zophim) stationed to protect the land, in the days before the Israelitish invasion, from the incursions of the tribes on the other side of Jordan (<a href="/numbers/23-14.htm">Numbers 23:14</a>). The position of Pisgah has not been precisely identified, but the range extended on the eastern side of Jordan to a point nearly opposite Jericho.
