The context is the battle where Joshua leads Israel against five Amorite kings. The Israelites' victory is attributed to divine intervention, emphasizing God's role in the conquest of Canaan. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God fighting for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>.<p><b>along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah</b><br>Beth-horon refers to two adjacent towns, Upper and Lower Beth-horon, strategically located on a ridge descending into the coastal plain. This route was significant for military campaigns, as it provided a natural path for retreat or advance. Azekah, another fortified city, is mentioned in the context of Judah's defense in <a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>. Archaeological evidence supports the historical existence of these locations, underscoring the biblical narrative's historical reliability.<p><b>the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky</b><br>This divine intervention through hailstones is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>), where God used natural phenomena to achieve His purposes. The hailstones signify God's direct involvement in the battle, reinforcing His sovereignty over creation. This act also prefigures eschatological judgments, as seen in <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>, where hailstones are used as instruments of divine wrath.<p><b>and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites</b><br>This highlights the miraculous nature of the victory, attributing the success primarily to God's power rather than human effort. It serves as a reminder of the futility of opposing God's will and the assurance of His protection for His people. This theme is echoed in <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>, which emphasizes that victories come not by human strength but by God's favor. The disproportionate impact of the hailstones underscores the message that God is the ultimate warrior for Israel, a type of Christ who secures victory for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Joshua, who were pursuing their enemies in battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-horon.htm">Beth-horon</a></b><br>A strategic location in the hill country of Ephraim, significant for its role in the battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/azekah.htm">Azekah</a></b><br>Another location in the Shephelah region of Judah, marking the path of the fleeing enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who intervenes supernaturally in the battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hailstones.htm">Hailstones</a></b><br>The miraculous means by which God defeated more of the enemy than the Israelites did with the sword.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battle.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battle</a></b><br>God is actively involved in the battles of His people, demonstrating His power and control over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>The LORD's use of hailstones shows that He can use any means to achieve His purposes, often beyond human understanding or capability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_power.htm">Trust in God's Power</a></b><br>Believers can trust that God will fight for them and that His methods, though sometimes unexpected, are always effective.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The hailstones serve as a reminder of God's righteous judgment against those who oppose Him and His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' pursuit of their enemies, in obedience to God's command, is met with divine assistance, encouraging believers to act in faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_10_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 10:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_11_God_s_power_over_nature.htm">How does Joshua 10:11 demonstrate God's power over nature and enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_hail_reveal_about_God_s_power.htm">What can we learn about God's intervention from "the LORD hurled large hailstones"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_11_and_divine_intervention_links.htm">How does Joshua 10:11 connect with other biblical instances of divine intervention?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_God_s_power_today_3.htm">How should believers respond when witnessing God's power in their lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_10_11_Trust_God_s_protection.htm">What does Joshua 10:11 teach about trusting God's protection in spiritual battles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_did_hailstones_kill_more_than_swords.htm">How did God cause hailstones to kill more than the sword in Joshua 10:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Joshua_10_11_event.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the event described in Joshua 10:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Does_Joshua_10_11_defy_natural_laws.htm">Does Joshua 10:11 challenge the natural laws as we understand them?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_no_trace_of_hailstones_in_joshua_10_11.htm">Why is there no definitive geological or historical trace of the destructive hailstones described in Joshua 10:11?

</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 10:11 Mean</div><b>As they fled before Israel</b><p>- The scene follows the sudden panic God sent into the five-king coalition (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>). Just as He foretold in <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>, &#8220;Not one of them shall stand before you,&#8221; the enemy turns and runs.<p>- This fulfills earlier covenant promises that hostile nations would &#8220;flee before you seven ways&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>).<p>- It mirrors other moments when God routed foes ahead of His people&#8212;Pharaoh&#8217;s army at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>) and Sisera&#8217;s troops before Deborah and Barak (<a href="/judges/4-15.htm">Judges 4:15</a>). The flight itself is evidence of divine intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah</b><p>- Beth-horon sits in the Judean hill country; the pass drops sharply toward the Shephelah. The enemy is forced down a narrow, twisting descent&#8212;an exposed route with no easy cover.<p>- God often uses terrain to magnify His power: the uphill climb of Michmash (<a href="/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a>) or the flooded Kishon Valley (<a href="/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>). Here, a steep downhill run leaves the Amorites vulnerable.<p>- Azekah, later a frontline against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>), becomes another stage where God showcases His supremacy in Israel&#8217;s early conquests (<a href="/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky</b><p>- Scripture attributes this phenomenon directly to &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; not to chance. Like the plague of hail in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-22.htm">Exodus 9:22-26</a>) and the storm that routed Sisera (<a href="/judges/5-20.htm">Judges 5:20-21</a>), the weather turns into a divine weapon.<p>- Hail is a repeated symbol of God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12-14</a>; <a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22-23</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-21.htm">Revelation 16:21</a>). Its sudden arrival in clear daylight underscores that the battle belongs to Him.<p>- The detail &#8220;large&#8221; stresses lethality; this is no mild shower but a supernatural barrage precisely timed and targeted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites</b><p>- The statistic highlights that ultimate victory rests with God, not human strength&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>, &#8220;It was not by their sword that they possessed the land&#8230; it was Your right hand.&#8221;<p>- Israel still fights (<a href="/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>), showing a partnership of obedience and faith, yet the heavier casualty count comes from heaven.<p>- This pattern recurs: Gideon&#8217;s 300 defeat Midian (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>), Jonathan and his armor-bearer topple a garrison (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>), and Jehoshaphat&#8217;s choir watches God ambush Moab (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-24</a>). In every case, human effort is real, but divine power is decisive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a> records a literal, historical miracle in which God turns nature itself into a weapon, fulfilling His promise to fight for Israel. The fleeing Amorites are trapped in a steep descent, then struck by divinely hurled hailstones, suffering greater losses from heaven&#8217;s assault than from Israel&#8217;s swords. The verse teaches that while God calls His people to act, their victories ultimately rest on His sovereign, interventionist power&#8212;a truth repeated throughout Scripture and still trustworthy today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great stones from heaven.</span> Calmet has taken great trouble to collect evidence for showers of actual stones from heaven upon the enemies of Israel. But the next sentence of the verse states that they were <span class="accented">hailstones</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>. And even if there were not sufficient evidence of the fall of hailstones large enough to do great destruction to man and beast, we might fall back upon the theory that this was a miraculous hailstorm, since the whole history teems with miraculous intervention. But in point of fact this is unnecessary. We need not go further back than the famous storm of August 2nd, 1879, for an account of hailstones of enormous size falling within fifty miles of London. And in tropical climates still more destructive storms are of no infrequent occurrence. Every treatise on physical geography teems with instances. Masius refers to the well known story of the relief afforded by a sudden shower to Marcus Aurelius and his army, which he follows Eusebius in thinking attributable to Christian prayers, but which the emperor, in a medal struck on the occasion, attributed to Jupiter Pluvius (see Neander, 'Hist. of Christian Church,' vol. 1.). He also fcites the verses of Claudian on a similar victory of Theodosius: <p><span class="accented">"O nimium dilecte Deo, tibi militat aether<br />Et conjurati veniunt ad praelia venti."</span> They were more which died with hailstones. A conclusive proof, both to the Israelites and their antagonists, that the victory was owing rather to the favour of God than to the power of man, and suggesting the exclamation of the Psalmist, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Thy Name give glory" (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>). See also <a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4, 5</a>. It is, perhaps, worth while to remark that the printers have modernized this passage.
