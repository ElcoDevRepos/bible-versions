The Israelites were commanded to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23-24</a>), which included the Hivites. This context sets the stage for the tension in this encounter, as the Israelites were wary of forming alliances with the local tribes, which could lead them away from their covenant with God.<p><b>&#8220;Perhaps you dwell near us.</b><br>The Israelites were cautious because they were aware of God's command not to make covenants with the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12</a>). The phrase indicates suspicion and a need for discernment. The Israelites were concerned about being deceived, as they were aware of the potential for nearby tribes to pose as distant travelers to secure a treaty.<p><b>How can we make a treaty with you?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects the Israelites' awareness of God's instructions in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, which forbade them from making treaties with the inhabitants of the land. The concern was that such treaties could lead to idolatry and compromise their distinct identity as God's chosen people.

The text underscores that &#8220;the men of Israel&#8221; initiate dialogue, showing their responsibility to discern truth and obey God&#8217;s directives (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>; <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>).<p>&#8226; God had explicitly forbidden covenants with the peoples of the land; the Israelites&#8217; caution here reflects awareness of that command, even before Joshua is consulted (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Perhaps you dwell near us</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Perhaps you dwell near us.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The possibility that the visitors are local triggers suspicion because proximity would put them under the ban&#8212;Israel was commanded to drive out nearby nations, not negotiate with them (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;perhaps&#8221; signals a testing of claims. Israel had heard the Gibeonites&#8217; story of coming &#8220;from a distant land&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>), yet they pause to weigh the evidence&#8212;an instructive model of discernment (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This hesitation exposes the Gibeonites&#8217; ruse: their worn-out supplies (<a href="/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4-5</a>) are intended to mask the truth that they live only a day&#8217;s journey away (<a href="/joshua/10-9.htm">Joshua 10:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How can we make a treaty with you?</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;How can we make a treaty with you?&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical: if the Hivites are indeed neighbors, covenant is impossible without disobeying God. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> is explicit: &#8220;You must make no covenant with them and show them no mercy&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The tension is practical as well as spiritual. Treaties involved mutual defense (<a href="/genesis/21-27.htm">Genesis 21:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>). Aligning with a Canaanite city would compromise Israel&#8217;s mission to occupy the land (<a href="/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By voicing the prohibition, the leaders affirm their accountability to God. Sadly, they will soon be deceived because they &#8220;did not seek the LORD&#8217;s counsel&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a> records Israel&#8217;s initial attempt to stay faithful to God&#8217;s clear command against making covenants with Canaanite neighbors. Their suspicion (&#8220;Perhaps you dwell near us&#8221;) and direct challenge (&#8220;How can we make a treaty with you?&#8221;) demonstrate proper discernment, yet their eventual failure to consult the Lord shows how human caution, unaided by prayerful dependence, can still fall short.
