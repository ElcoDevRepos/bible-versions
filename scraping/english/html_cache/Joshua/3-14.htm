The act of breaking camp signifies readiness and obedience to God's command. The Jordan River represents a boundary between the wilderness and the land of Canaan, symbolizing a transition from wandering to inheritance. Historically, the Jordan River was at flood stage during this time, making the crossing a miraculous event (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). This moment parallels the crossing of the Red Sea, highlighting God's continued provision and faithfulness.<p><b>the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant, a sacred chest containing the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, symbolizes God's presence and covenant with Israel. The priests, as mediators between God and the people, carrying the Ark ahead, signifies that God leads His people. This act demonstrates the importance of divine guidance and the centrality of God's presence in achieving victory and fulfilling His promises. The Ark going before the people foreshadows Christ, who goes before us as our High Priest and mediator (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).
