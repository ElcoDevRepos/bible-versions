It symbolized the Israelites' commitment to God and their identity as His chosen people. Joshua's decision to circumcise the new generation underscores the importance of renewing this covenant before entering the Promised Land. This act also signifies a spiritual preparation and purification, aligning with the theme of consecration seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>All those who came out of Egypt:</b><br>This phrase refers to the original generation of Israelites who were delivered from slavery in Egypt. Their exodus was a pivotal event in Israel's history, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness. The deliverance from Egypt is frequently referenced throughout the Bible as a foundational act of salvation and liberation (Exodus 12-14).<p><b>all the men of war:</b><br>The "men of war" were those who were counted as able-bodied soldiers, typically aged 20 and above (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). This demographic was crucial for the conquest of Canaan, yet the original generation failed to trust God fully, leading to their demise in the wilderness. This highlights the importance of faith and obedience in fulfilling God's promises.<p><b>had died on the journey in the wilderness:</b><br>The death of the original generation in the wilderness was a direct consequence of their disobedience and lack of faith, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>. This period of wandering lasted 40 years, during which God provided for the Israelites but also disciplined them. The wilderness journey serves as a reminder of the consequences of unbelief and the necessity of trusting in God's promises.<p><b>after they had left Egypt:</b><br>The departure from Egypt marks the beginning of Israel's journey towards the Promised Land. It was a transition from slavery to freedom, yet the journey was fraught with challenges due to the people's rebellion and lack of faith. This phrase emphasizes the contrast between the initial deliverance and the subsequent failure to enter the land due to disobedience. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of perseverance and faithfulness in the Christian walk.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for 40 years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A covenantal sign given to Abraham and his descendants, symbolizing their unique relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>The act of circumcision in <a href="/joshua/5-4.htm">Joshua 5:4</a> represents a renewal of the covenant with God.

Joshua isn&#8217;t acting on a whim; he is carrying out the covenant command originally given to Abraham: &#8220;This is My covenant that you are to keep&#8230;every male among you must be circumcised&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s obedience echoes Moses&#8217; earlier insistence that uncircumcised males could not partake of Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-44.htm">Exodus 12:44&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; By circumcising the new generation before they fight for the land, Joshua aligns them with God&#8217;s promise and power (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The act reaffirms the unbroken line of covenant from Abraham through Moses to Joshua, emphasizing that victory in Canaan depends on faithfulness, not mere military strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-6.htm">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All those who came out of Egypt</b><p>This phrase points back to the exodus generation, the people who witnessed the plagues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>) and crossed the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29</a>).<p>&#8226; They had experienced God&#8217;s redemption firsthand, yet many remained hard-hearted (<a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Mentioning them here contrasts the old, unbelieving generation with the new, covenant-renewed generation standing at the Jordan (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-2.htm">Deuteronomy 29:2&#8211;4, 9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness is highlighted: He preserved Israel&#8217;s national identity despite forty years of wandering (<a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the men of war</b><p>The spotlight turns specifically to the fighting men who had been numbered for battle at Sinai (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their role was to enter Canaan, yet fear of giants and fortified cities led them to rebel (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; God decreed that every numbered soldier twenty years and older would fall in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; The new generation of warriors now preparing to fight Jericho is marked by covenant faith rather than fear (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had died on the journey in the wilderness</b><p>Their deaths were not random; they fulfilled God&#8217;s solemn oath: &#8220;In this wilderness your bodies will fall&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/14-32.htm">Numbers 14:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The forty-year delay was both discipline and purification (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Daily burials reminded Israel that unbelief carries real consequences (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; By the time Israel camped at Gilgal, that generation was gone, making room for a people ready to trust (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after they had left Egypt</b><p>The clause underscores a tragic irony: the same people God saved from slavery never enjoyed the promised rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-6.htm">Hebrews 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance from Egypt was only the beginning; ongoing faith was required to enter Canaan (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-29.htm">Hebrews 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s grace brought them out, but obedience was meant to bring them in (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-23.htm">Deuteronomy 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The new generation must now embrace both aspects&#8212;redeemed from bondage and committed to covenant obedience (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/5-4.htm">Joshua 5:4</a> reminds us that covenant faithfulness is essential for experiencing God&#8217;s promises. Joshua&#8217;s act of circumcising the new generation reconnects Israel to the Abrahamic sign, distinguishes them from the unbelieving soldiers who perished, and positions them to receive the land God swore to give. The verse sets a contrast between a redeemed yet faithless past and a present generation ready to trust and obey, underlining that God&#8217;s victory belongs to a people marked by covenant loyalty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">The cause why Joshua did circumcise.</span>--As the narrative stands it is not quite obvious why uncircumcision is called "the reproach of Egypt," whereas all the people born in Egypt were circumcised. The uncircumcision attached to those who were born in the wilderness, during the years of wandering. But that period of wandering, between the departure from Kadesh-barnea and the return to Kadesh (thirty-seven and a half years, Numbers 15-19, inclusive), is a kind of blank in the story of the Exodus. The five chapters which belong to it in the Book of Numbers contain no note of progress as to time or place. The people had "turned back in their hearts to Egypt" (<a href="/acts/7-39.htm" title="To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,">Acts 7:39</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-4.htm" title="And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.">Numbers 14:4</a>), and were bearing the reproach of their apostasy all those years, "the reproach of Egypt." Suffering under the "breach of promise" of Jehovah (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>), they appear to have omitted the sign of the covenant, as though they were no longer the people of God. The passage of Jordan was the practical proof of Israel's restoration to Divine favour, and they were brought into covenant with Him once more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After they came out from Egypt.</span> Rather "<span class="accented">on their journey</span> from Egypt."
