In this context, it marks the short duration between the Israelites' decision and the discovery of the Gibeonites' deception. The treaty was made under false pretenses, as the Gibeonites had disguised themselves as travelers from a distant land to secure peace with Israel. This reflects the importance of seeking divine guidance before making covenants, a lesson underscored by the Israelites' failure to consult God before agreeing to the treaty (<a href="/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>).<p><b>the Israelites learned that they were neighbors</b><br>The realization that the Gibeonites were actually nearby inhabitants highlights the Israelites' vulnerability to deception when relying solely on human judgment. This discovery would have been a shock, as the Israelites were commanded to conquer the land and its peoples (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). The Gibeonites' proximity posed a direct challenge to this divine mandate, illustrating the tension between God's commands and the Israelites' actions.<p><b>living among them</b><br>The phrase "living among them" indicates the integration of the Gibeonites into the Israelite community, which was contrary to God's instructions to separate from the Canaanite nations to avoid idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>). This situation foreshadows future challenges Israel would face with other neighboring peoples. The Gibeonites' presence among the Israelites also serves as a type of the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, prefiguring the New Testament revelation of the gospel being extended to all nations (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
