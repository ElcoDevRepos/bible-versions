In the context of <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, this refers to Achan's sin of taking devoted things from Jericho, which were meant to be destroyed or dedicated to the Lord. This phrase highlights the principle that sin within the community can lead to collective failure. Historically, the Israelites were a people set apart by God, and their success was contingent upon their faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>They will turn their backs and run from their enemies,</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of the victory and confidence the Israelites experienced at Jericho. The imagery of turning their backs suggests shame and defeat, contrasting with the triumph they were promised if they obeyed God. This reflects the broader biblical theme that disobedience leads to fear and retreat, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where God warns of such consequences for unfaithfulness.<p><b>because they themselves have been set apart for destruction.</b><br>The term "set apart for destruction" echoes the concept of "herem," where certain things are devoted to God, often through destruction, as a form of judgment. In this context, the Israelites, due to Achan's sin, are under the same judgment meant for the Canaanites. This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the holiness required by God. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God for those who do not repent.<p><b>I will no longer be with you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.</b><br>God's presence with Israel was conditional upon their obedience and holiness. This phrase underscores the necessity of purging sin from the community to restore fellowship with God. It reflects the broader biblical narrative where God's presence is contingent upon purity and obedience, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a> and <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>. The call to remove what is devoted to destruction points to the need for repentance and cleansing, a theme fulfilled in Christ, who provides the ultimate means of purification and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are experiencing defeat due to disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/achan.htm">Achan</a></b><br>The individual whose sin of taking devoted things led to Israel's defeat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ai.htm">Ai</a></b><br>The city where the Israelites faced defeat due to Achan's sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devoted_things.htm">The devoted things</a></b><br>Items that were supposed to be destroyed or dedicated to God, but were taken by Achan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God's commands can lead to defeat and separation from His presence.

This plain statement disposes of the idea that the repulse before Ai was simply the result of Joshua's rashness in sending so small a body of troops. The vivid narrative of the detection of Achan, obviously taken from contemporary records, precedes the account of the final capture of the city, although Joshua, who, as we have seen, does not neglect to employ human means, resolves to take greater precautions before making a second attack. Not a hint is dropped that the former number of men was insufficient, or that Joshua had been misled by the information brought by the reconnoitring party. In the mind of the historian the defect is entirely owing to the existence of secret sin in the Israelitish camp. <span class="cmt_word">Except ye destroy the accursed from among.</span> Dr. Maclear, in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools,' calls attention to the fact that <a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a> is a quotation from the LXX. here, substituting, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is why the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
