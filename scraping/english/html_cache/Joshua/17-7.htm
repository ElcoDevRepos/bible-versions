The reference to "Asher" here is not the tribe of Asher but a location within the territory of Manasseh. This indicates the starting point of the boundary line. The land allocation for Manasseh was part of the division of Canaan among the tribes of Israel, as commanded by God to Joshua. This division fulfilled the promises made to the patriarchs about the land inheritance.<p><b>to Michmethath near Shechem</b><br>Michmethath is a location whose exact site is uncertain today, but it is described as being near Shechem, a significant city in biblical history. Shechem was a central city in the hill country of Ephraim and held historical and religious importance. It was the first place where Abraham built an altar to the Lord in Canaan. Shechem later became a city of refuge and a Levitical city, highlighting its continued importance in Israelite society.<p><b>then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah</b><br>En-tappuah, or the "spring of Tappuah," was a location within the territory of Manasseh. The mention of inhabitants suggests a settled area, possibly a village or town. The direction "southward" indicates the boundary line's movement, emphasizing the specific allocation of land to the tribe of Manasseh. This allocation was part of the broader fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites a land flowing with milk and honey, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Manasseh.

By naming Asher first, the text anchors the boundary in real geography, underscoring that God&#8217;s allotment was literal land, not merely symbolic (cf. <a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a> - 31).<p>&#8226; This fulfills earlier promises that half-tribe territory would be firmly established on both sides of the Jordan (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>; <a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that every tribe received exactly what God ordained&#8212;no more, no less (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Michmethath near Shechem</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to Michmethath near Shechem&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Michmethath marks the eastern edge; Shechem sits in the heart of the land (<a href="/joshua/17-18.htm">Joshua 17:18</a>).

God grants Manasseh both land and people, stressing responsibility to shepherd residents within those bounds.<p>&#8226; En-tappuah&#8217;s inclusion highlights God&#8217;s meticulous care: every village, family, and field mattered in His covenant economy (<a href="/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The southward turn also prevents tribal strife by clearly marking limits (<a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>), demonstrating divine wisdom in preventing future boundary disputes (<a href="/proverbs/15-18.htm">Proverbs 15:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a> records a precise slice of Manasseh&#8217;s border&#8212;from Asher, past Michmethath near Shechem, then south to En-tappuah. The verse shows God&#8217;s faithfulness in distributing literal land, roots the tribe in covenant history at Shechem, and assigns clear, peaceful boundaries.

This has been supposed not to be the <span class="accented">tribe</span> of Asher, for this was on the north, but a city which has been identified with the modern Yasir, about five hours' distance from Nablous, or Neapolis, on the road to Beisan,or Beth-shean, where, says Delitzsch, there are "magnificent ruins" now to be seen. See, however, note ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">Michmethah</span> (see <a href="/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>). This place has not been identified. All we know is that it is opposite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Shechem. Some have thought that this is simply the denominative of Asher, to distinguish it from the tribe, and that for "Asher to Michmethah" we should read "Asher-ham-Michmethah." But this could hardly be the Yasir above, since it is opposite Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span>. Now Nablous. This place is famous both in the Old and the New Testament. We first read of it, under the name of Sichem, in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. It was the abode of Shechem and Hamor his son, when Jacob abode in Canaan after his return from Padan-aram. It was situated between Gerizim and Ebal, and became an important city in the days of the Judges (<a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>.). It was destroyed by Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a>), but it seems to have recovered. It was thither that Rehoboam went to be crowned, and there that his injudicious answer alienated forever the ten tribes from his rule. Jeroboam made it his capital and is said to have "built" it (<a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). He afterwards, however, abandoned it for Penuel, and Penuel again apparently for Tirzah (<a href="/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>), and Tirzah for Jezreel, which remained the capital until Omri built Samaria (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It is no doubt the Sychar mentioned in St. <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Most travelers have admired the picturesque situation of Shechem. It has even extorted a tribute from Dr. Peterman, in his 'Reisen im Orient,' a work which, however full of valuable information regarding the condition and customs of the people, does not abound m description of scenery. He becomes almost poetical as he speaks of this town, resting on the slopes of Gerizim, a mountain fruitful to its summit, and having opposite the bare, stony el Ebal, its outline unrelieved by verdure, the haunt of jackals, whose howls, like the cry of wailing children in distress, disturb the silence of the night. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 470) thus describes the scene: "A valley green with grass, grey with olives, gardens sloping down on each side, fresh springs rushing down in all directions; at the end a white town embosomed in all this verdure lodged between the two high mountains which extend on each side of the valley; this is the aspect of Nablous, the most beautiful, perhaps it might be said the only beautiful, spot in Central Palestine. Thirty-two springs can be traced in different parts. Here the bilbul delights to sit and sing, and thousands of other birds delight to swell the chorus." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/17-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the border</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1366.htm">Strong's 1366: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cord, a boundary, the territory inclosed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Manasseh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;na&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4519.htm">Strong's 4519: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manasseh -- 'causing to forget', a son of Joseph, also a king of Judah, also two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
