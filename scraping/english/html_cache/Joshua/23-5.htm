The Israelites are reminded that it is not by their own strength but by God's intervention that their enemies will be removed. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God fighting for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where God promises to fight for Israel. The phrase also underscores God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, as He had previously assured Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>.<p><b>and drive them out before you</b><br>Here, the focus is on the active role of God in ensuring the removal of the Canaanite nations. This action is both a fulfillment of divine justice against the iniquity of these nations (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>) and a demonstration of God's covenant faithfulness to Israel. The driving out of the nations is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, where God promises to go before Israel and clear the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>). This also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Christ, who conquers spiritual enemies on behalf of believers.<p><b>so that you can take possession of their land</b><br>This phrase highlights the purpose of God's actions: to enable Israel to inherit the land promised to their forefathers. The land is a central element of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), symbolizing God's blessing and provision. The concept of taking possession is not merely physical but also spiritual, as it involves living according to God's laws and maintaining covenant faithfulness. This foreshadows the New Testament promise of believers inheriting the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>).<p><b>as the LORD your God promised you</b><br>The concluding phrase reaffirms the reliability of God's promises. It connects back to the covenantal assurances given to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This promise is a testament to God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The fulfillment of this promise in Joshua's time serves as a type of the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in Christ, who secures an eternal inheritance for His people (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites, reminding them of God's promises and their responsibilities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who has promised to drive out the nations before Israel and give them the land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The various Canaanite tribes and peoples inhabiting the Promised Land, whom God has promised to drive out before Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants as an inheritance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called to take possession of the land promised to them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_promises.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Promises</a></b><br>God is faithful to fulfill His promises, as seen in His commitment to drive out the nations before Israel.

This balance of divine initiative and human responsibility is a model for Christian living, where believers rely on God's power while actively pursuing His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Joshua's reminder to Israel underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. For Christians, obedience is a response to God's grace and a pathway to experiencing His blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare_and_victory.htm">Spiritual Warfare and Victory</a></b><br>The physical battles Israel faced are a type of the spiritual battles Christians encounter. Victory comes through reliance on God's strength and adherence to His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance_and_rest.htm">Inheritance and Rest</a></b><br>The Promised Land symbolizes the inheritance and rest believers have in Christ.
