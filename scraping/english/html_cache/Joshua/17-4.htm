Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served as the high priest, representing the spiritual leadership. Joshua, as the successor of Moses, was the military and administrative leader. The leaders likely refer to tribal heads or elders. This approach underscores the importance of seeking guidance from both spiritual and civil authorities, reflecting the theocratic nature of Israelite society. It also demonstrates the unity and cooperation between religious and political leadership in executing God's commands.<p><b>and said, &#8220;The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.&#8221;</b><br>This statement refers to the daughters of Zelophehad, who approached Moses in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>. Their request was based on a direct command from God, emphasizing the importance of adhering to divine instructions. This command ensured that the inheritance laws were just and inclusive, allowing for the preservation of family lineage and property rights even when no male heirs were present. It highlights God's concern for justice and equity within the community, ensuring that all members, regardless of gender, have a rightful place and inheritance.<p><b>So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father&#8217;s brothers</b><br>Joshua's compliance with the command reflects his obedience and faithfulness to God's instructions. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promises and the continuity of His covenant with Israel. By granting the daughters of Zelophehad their inheritance, Joshua upheld the principle of justice and the importance of family heritage. This act also serves as a type of Christ, who ensures that all believers, regardless of status, receive their spiritual inheritance in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>in keeping with the command of the LORD.</b><br>This phrase underscores the centrality of God's word in guiding the actions of Israel's leaders. It reflects the belief that divine commands are paramount and must be followed precisely. The adherence to God's command in this context serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's will, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It also points to the reliability and faithfulness of God in fulfilling His promises, as seen in the broader narrative of Israel's conquest and settlement in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>The son of Aaron, Eleazar served as the high priest after Aaron's death.
