The capture of the kings and their cities signifies the conquest of the northern coalition of Canaanite kings, which is a continuation of the campaign that began in the southern region. This conquest is a testament to God's faithfulness in delivering the land to Israel as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The cities mentioned were strategically important, and their capture ensured control over the region.<p><b>and put them to the sword.</b><br>This phrase indicates the complete military defeat and execution of the Canaanite kings and their armies. The phrase "put them to the sword" is a common biblical expression for total destruction in battle. This action was part of the divine judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>. It also served to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the Canaanite religious practices.<p><b>He devoted them to destruction,</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" (Hebrew: herem) refers to the complete consecration of something to God, often through its destruction. This was a command given to ensure that nothing from the conquered cities would lead the Israelites into idolatry or sin. The concept of herem is seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the destruction of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17-21</a>). It underscores the seriousness of maintaining purity and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>as Moses the LORD&#8217;s servant had commanded.</b><br>This phrase connects Joshua's actions to the instructions given by Moses, emphasizing continuity in leadership and obedience to God's law. Moses, as the LORD's servant, had received direct commands from God regarding the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). Joshua's adherence to these commands demonstrates his faithfulness and the importance of following divine instructions. This obedience is a key theme throughout the book of Joshua and serves as a model for the Israelites and future generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joshua is the leader of the Israelites following Moses.

are the coalition leaders listed in <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-5</a>; their defeat fulfills God&#8217;s assurance in <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27-31</a> that Israel would conquer the land little by little under divine direction.<p>- The victory shows that obedience brings the realization of God&#8217;s covenant promises first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>) and reiterated to Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-23.htm">Deuteronomy 11:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their cities</b><p>- Taking the cities means securing the strategic centers of Canaan, just as <a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a> foretold Israel would inherit &#8220;cities you did not build.&#8221;<p>- It underscores that the conquest was comprehensive, leaving no fortified strongholds to rekindle idolatry&#8212;anticipating warnings in <a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a> about the danger of leaving remnants that could become &#8220;barbs in your eyes.&#8221;<p>- The fall of these urban hubs mirrors earlier victories over Jericho and Ai (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>; 8), confirming a consistent pattern of God-given triumph.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put them to the sword</b><p>- The phrase points to complete military defeat, paralleling <a href="/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-40</a> where southern kings were likewise struck down &#8220;with the edge of the sword.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s justice is in view: <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> indicated the Amorites&#8217; sin had reached its full measure, and <a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a> clarifies Israel was not receiving the land for its own righteousness but because of the nations&#8217; wickedness.<p>- The sword was the instrument of divine judgment (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> later affirms governing authorities bear the sword as God&#8217;s servant for wrath).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He devoted them to destruction</b><p>- &#8220;Devoted&#8221;

to prevent Israel from learning detestable practices and turning to idolatry.<p>- The principle protects purity of worship; when Saul later violated this command with Amalek, <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a> shows the serious consequences of partial obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as Moses the LORD&#8217;s servant had commanded</b><p>- Joshua acts under delegated authority, aligning with <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a> where Moses commissioned Joshua and laid hands on him before the congregation, charging him to do all the Lord commanded.<p>- By following Moses&#8217; instructions (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7-8</a>), Joshua models continuity of leadership and fidelity to God&#8217;s word, a theme reinforced in <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-8</a>: &#8220;Do not turn from it to the right or the left.&#8221;<p>- The phrase reminds readers that this conquest was not a human initiative but a long-standing divine directive communicated through Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10-12</a> credits Moses as the unparalleled prophet through whom the Lord worked mighty acts).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/11-12.htm">Joshua 11:12</a> records total victory achieved through unwavering obedience. Joshua captures the coalition kings, secures their cities, executes God&#8217;s judgment by the sword, and devotes the defeated to destruction exactly as Moses had commanded.
