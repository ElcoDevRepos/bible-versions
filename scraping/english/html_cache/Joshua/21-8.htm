This distribution reflects the Levites' unique role as spiritual leaders and mediators between God and Israel. The Levites did not receive a contiguous territory like other tribes, emphasizing their dependence on God and the community for sustenance. This arrangement also facilitated their service in the tabernacle and later the temple, as they were spread throughout the land, making religious instruction and worship accessible to all Israelites.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands was essential for the Levites' sustenance, as they did not have a large inheritance of land for agriculture. These lands provided for their livestock, which was a primary source of food and resources. This provision ensured that the Levites could focus on their spiritual duties without the burden of agricultural labor. The pasturelands also symbolize God's provision and care for those dedicated to His service, reflecting a principle seen throughout Scripture where God provides for those who serve Him.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded through Moses</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the Levites' inheritance, highlighting obedience to God's commands as delivered through Moses. It reflects the continuity of God's covenant promises and the importance of adhering to His instructions. The command given through Moses can be traced back to passages such as <a href="/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>, where God outlines the provision of cities for the Levites. This obedience to divine command is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of following God's will as revealed through His prophets and leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were chosen by God to be His people and were given the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service to God.
