Their response here is part of a dialogue with Joshua and the Israelites after their deception was uncovered. This interaction highlights the Gibeonites' awareness of Israel's divine mandate and their strategic decision to secure a treaty through deception.<p><b>Your servants were told clearly</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Gibeonites had received specific information about the Israelites' conquests and God's commands. It suggests that news of Israel's victories and divine backing had spread throughout Canaan, causing fear among its inhabitants. The Gibeonites' use of "your servants" is a diplomatic gesture, acknowledging Israel's authority.<p><b>that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses</b><br>The reference to "the LORD your God" acknowledges the God of Israel as the supreme deity, distinct from the Canaanite gods. The mention of Moses connects this event to the broader narrative of the Exodus and the giving of the Law, where God instructed Moses to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land.<p><b>to give you all the land</b><br>This phrase refers to the divine promise given to the patriarchs, reiterated to Moses, and now being fulfilled under Joshua's leadership. The land of Canaan was promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and this promise is central to Israel's identity and mission.<p><b>and wipe out all its inhabitants before you</b><br>This command, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>, was part of God's instructions to prevent the Israelites from being led astray by the idolatrous practices of the Canaanites. The Gibeonites' awareness of this command underscores the seriousness of Israel's divine mission and the threat it posed to the existing inhabitants.<p><b>So we greatly feared for our lives because of you</b><br>The fear of the Gibeonites reflects the broader fear among Canaanite nations as they witnessed Israel's conquests. This fear is reminiscent of Rahab's words in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where she acknowledges the terror that had fallen on the inhabitants of the land due to Israel's God.<p><b>and that is why we have done this</b><br>The Gibeonites' deception was a survival tactic, motivated by their fear of annihilation. Their actions, while deceitful, resulted in their preservation and eventual integration into Israelite society, serving as woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and the altar of the LORD. This outcome illustrates themes of mercy and the unexpected ways God's purposes can unfold.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land and conquering it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>Inhabitants of Gibeon who deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them to avoid destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of the LORD who received the command to conquer the land and destroy its inhabitants, which was passed on to Joshua.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who commanded the conquest of Canaan and the destruction of its inhabitants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>The Israelites failed to seek God's guidance before making a treaty with the Gibeonites.

This affirms the literal reliability of God&#8217;s prior commands (<a href="/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50&#8211;53</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: unbelievers may comprehend more of God&#8217;s Word than we expect, yet still stand outside the covenant until they respond rightly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before you.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This summarizes the conquest mandate (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>; <a href="/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All the land&#8221; points to the unconditional nature of God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wipe out all its inhabitants&#8221; was God&#8217;s judicial sentence on entrenched wickedness (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; The Gibeonites interpret these commands as certain; they see no possibility of escape apart from mercy. Their logic is sound: if God&#8217;s Word is sure, resistance is futile.<p>&#8226; For believers, the same certainty applies to every promise and warning in Scripture (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Fear is the dominant human response when God&#8217;s holiness collides with sin (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The Gibeonites&#8217; dread moves them to seek covenant protection, albeit through deceit (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Their strategy contrasts with Rahab&#8217;s open plea for mercy (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12&#8211;13</a>). Both received preservation, yet Rahab gained full inclusion, while the Gibeonites became perpetual servants (<a href="/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Lesson: accurate knowledge of God&#8217;s power must lead to repentance and honest surrender, not manipulative self-saving.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/9-24.htm">Joshua 9:24</a> records the Gibeonites&#8217; own explanation: they heard the unmistakable report of God&#8217;s command to Moses to grant Israel the whole land and destroy its peoples, so sheer terror drove them to act. The verse underscores the reliability of God&#8217;s Word, the inevitability of His judgment, and the universal impact of His mighty deeds. Even outsiders can grasp divine truth; what matters is how we respond&#8212;by humble, truthful submission that seeks His mercy, not by fearful schemes that merely postpone reckoning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord thy God Commanded</span> (see <a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1, 2</a>).
