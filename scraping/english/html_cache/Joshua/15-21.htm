The tribe of Judah, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come, was given a significant portion of land. The southernmost cities indicate the extent of Judah's territory, emphasizing the tribe's strategic and protective role for Israel's southern border.<p><b>in the Negev</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in southern Israel, characterized by its arid climate and sparse vegetation. It served as a natural barrier and was crucial for the defense of the nation. The Negev's harsh environment required resilience and adaptability, traits that were essential for the inhabitants of these cities.<p><b>toward the border of Edom</b><br>Edom, located southeast of Judah, was often in conflict with Israel. The border with Edom was significant for trade routes and military strategy. The relationship between Israel and Edom was complex, with Edom being descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, highlighting the ongoing familial tensions and fulfillment of prophecies regarding these nations.<p><b>Kabzeel</b><br>Kabzeel was a city on the frontier of Judah, later known as Jekabzeel. It was the hometown of Benaiah, one of David's mighty warriors, illustrating the city's contribution to Israel's military strength. The mention of Kabzeel underscores the importance of local heroes in the broader narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>Eder</b><br>Eder, meaning "flock" or "herd," suggests a pastoral setting, which was common in the Negev. The city's name reflects the agricultural lifestyle of its inhabitants, who relied on livestock for sustenance. This connection to pastoral life is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, symbolizing God's provision and care.<p><b>Jagur</b><br>Little is known about Jagur, but its inclusion in the list of cities highlights the comprehensive nature of the land distribution. Each city, regardless of its size or prominence, played a role in the collective identity and security of the tribe of Judah. The mention of lesser-known cities like Jagur emphasizes the detailed record-keeping and the importance of every part of the land in God's plan for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Judah, the fourth son of Jacob and Leah.

The term here used (see above, ver. 19) for "south" is the one which has the signification of dryness. It is, however, occasionally used in a less strict sense, as in <a href="/joshua/19-24.htm">Joshua 19:24</a>. Though the south country was in the main an arid region, yet its intersection by numerous wadys, with their attendant streams, provided fertile spots at intervals, where the traveller might rest, cattle might be watered, and corn and other produce raised. The only places of any importance in Scripture history mentioned here are Beersheba (see <a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and Hormah (see <a href="/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; and cf. <a href="/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>; and <a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>).

Ziklag is famous as the residence of David (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). It is noteworthy that t was given to him by Achish, king of Gath, in whose possession it therefore was at that time.
