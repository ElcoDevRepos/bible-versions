The tribe of Simeon, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, was descended from Simeon, the second son of Jacob and Leah. The mention of "clans" indicates the subdivision of the tribe into family groups, which was common in Israelite society. This allocation follows the earlier distribution to the tribe of Judah, highlighting the orderly process of land division.<p><b>Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah:</b><br>Simeon's inheritance being within Judah's territory is significant, as it reflects the fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>, where Simeon and Levi are said to be scattered in Israel. Historically, Simeon did not have a distinct, separate territory but was instead integrated into Judah's land. This arrangement may have been due to Simeon's smaller population or as a result of their actions in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>. Geographically, this area is in the southern part of Canaan, which was a strategic location for trade and defense.

And the name of the city was called Hormah.">Judges 1:17</a>.) In this fact a prophecy was fulfilled; for the effect of the allotment was to separate Simeon from the tribes with whom he had been united in the journey through the wilderness (viz., Reuben and Gad), who had cast off Simeon, and united themselves with the half tribe of Manasseh instead. Being also separated from Levi, Simeon was still further isolated: with the result that in the final separation of Israel and Judah, after Solomon's death, the tribe of Simeon, though adhering to the kingdom of the ten tribes (for the children of Simeon were counted <span class= "ital">strangers </span>in Judah--<a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm" title="And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.">2Chronicles 15:9</a>), was separated from the territory of that kingdom by the whole breadth of the kingdom of Judah.

Simeon, at the last census (<a href="/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>), was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, a fulfilment of the prophecy of Jacob, and possibly the result of the command given in <a href="/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, since the Simeonites were the chief offenders on that occasion (<a href="/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>; see also <a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The distribution of territory was in accordance with this, and it is possible that the lot only determined the priority of choice among the tribes. The territory of Judah seems to have been recognised as too large, in spite of the importance of the tribe.
