The direction "westward" indicates the movement from a starting point, likely from the Jordan River or a central location within the tribal allotment. Maralah is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, suggesting it was a minor or less significant location. The westward movement signifies the expansion of territory, a common theme in the conquest narratives of Joshua, where the Israelites are taking possession of the Promised Land as God had commanded.<p><b>reached Dabbesheth</b><br>Dabbesheth is another location mentioned only here in the Bible, indicating its role as a boundary marker rather than a significant settlement. The name Dabbesheth means "hump" or "hill," suggesting a geographical feature that would have been recognizable to the Israelites. This reflects the practical nature of boundary descriptions in ancient times, using natural landmarks to delineate territories. The use of such markers is consistent with other boundary descriptions in the tribal allotments found in Joshua.<p><b>and met the brook east of Jokneam</b><br>The brook mentioned here serves as a natural boundary, a common practice in ancient territorial delineations. Jokneam is a more significant location, identified as a Levitical city in <a href="/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>. It is situated in the territory of Zebulun but near the border with the tribe of Asher. The mention of Jokneam provides a point of reference for understanding the extent of Zebulun's territory. In biblical history, Jokneam is associated with the Canaanite king defeated by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/12-22.htm">Joshua 12:22</a>), highlighting the ongoing fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel. The use of natural features like brooks for boundaries underscores the Israelites' connection to the land and God's provision for each tribe's inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/maralah.htm">Maralah</a></b><br>A location marking the boundary of the land allotted to the tribe of Zebulun.
