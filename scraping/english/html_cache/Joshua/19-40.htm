The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting that the allocation of land was part of God's perfect plan for His people.<p><b>came out</b><br>The phrase "came out" indicates the outcome of the lot casting, emphasizing the belief that the result was not random but orchestrated by God. This reflects the Israelites' trust in God's sovereignty over their inheritance.<p><b>for the clans</b><br>The term "clans" refers to the subdivisions within the tribe, highlighting the importance of family and kinship in Israelite society. Each clan within the tribe of Dan would receive its portion of the land, ensuring that the inheritance was distributed fairly among the families.<p><b>of the tribe of Dan</b><br>Dan was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, named after Jacob's fifth son by Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant. The tribe of Dan is often associated with both positive and negative aspects in biblical history. Geographically, the territory allotted to Dan was initially located in the central coastal region of Canaan. However, due to pressure from neighboring peoples, the Danites later migrated northward, as described in <a href="/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.

(See Numbers 1, 26) This tribe had also had a post of honour in being commander of the rear-guard during the march. A similar post is here assigned to Dan in Palestine, viz., next to Judah, on the side of the Philistine territory. The Philistines were the most powerful and warlike of the unconquered nations of Palestine. The wisdom of guarding Israel on their frontier by the two strongest of the tribes is manifest. It was Samson, a Danite, who began to deliver Israel from them, and David completed the work. Though there were Philistine wars in the time of the later kings, they never had dominion over Israel after David's time.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/19-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Number - ordinal masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7637.htm">Strong's 7637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventh (an ordinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1486.htm">Strong's 1486: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lot -- a lot (for casting)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the clans</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Dan:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1835.htm">Strong's 1835: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dan -- 'judge', a son of Jacob, also a place in Northern Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">OT History: Joshua 19:40 The seventh lot came out (Josh.
