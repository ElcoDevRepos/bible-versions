The mission was to gather intelligence on Jericho, a key city in the conquest of Canaan. The spies' success depended on Rahab's discretion. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people acting wisely and prudently in hostile environments. The mission's secrecy is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where discretion was crucial, such as David's escape from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11-17</a>).<p><b>we will be released from the oath</b><br>Oaths were considered sacred and binding in ancient Israelite culture, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>. Breaking an oath was a serious offense, often invoking divine judgment. However, the spies clarify that the oath is conditional upon Rahab's cooperation. This reflects the biblical principle that covenants and agreements are mutual and require both parties to uphold their commitments. The conditional nature of this oath underscores the seriousness with which oaths were regarded.<p><b>you made us swear.</b><br>Rahab's role in making the spies swear an oath indicates her active participation and agency in the narrative. Her insistence on an oath demonstrates her understanding of the gravity and binding nature of such promises. This reflects the cultural context where oaths were a means of ensuring trust and fidelity. Rahab's actions also foreshadow her inclusion in the lineage of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>), highlighting God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan. Her faith and actions are commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, illustrating her as a model of faith and works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho who hid the Israelite spies.

Rahab&#8217;s silence will be the tangible evidence of her trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we will be released</b><p>&#8226; The spies acknowledge that their obligation is conditional. If Rahab breaks her side, they are freed from theirs.<p>&#8226; Vows in Scripture are binding only so long as the stated terms are met (<a href="/genesis/24-8.htm">Genesis 24:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This clause highlights personal accountability: each party bears responsibility for upholding covenant terms (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the oath</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The oath&#8221; points back to the solemn promise made in God&#8217;s name (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12</a>). Such oaths carried divine weight; breaking them invited judgment (<a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying release &#8220;from the oath,&#8221; the spies make clear that God Himself will no longer hold them to it if Rahab betrays them. This underscores the seriousness with which believers must approach promises made before the Lord (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33&#8211;37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you made us swear</b><p>&#8226; Rahab initiated the oath, showing her earnest desire for deliverance (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12&#8211;13</a>). The spies simply responded to her request.<p>&#8226; Although Rahab is an outsider, her faith moves her to seek covenant protection, just as God later welcomes all who come to Him through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Her insistence on an oath demonstrates both her understanding of Israel&#8217;s God and her certainty that Jericho will fall (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/2-20.htm">Joshua 2:20</a> teaches that divine covenants involve clear conditions, personal accountability, and unwavering faithfulness. The spies promise safety to Rahab, but only if she remains loyal to them by keeping their mission secret. Should she fail, they are absolved of their vow. The verse underscores the gravity of oaths made before God and illustrates how genuine faith expresses itself through obedient action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if thou utter this our business.</span> This was an obvious condition.
