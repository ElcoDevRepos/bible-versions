It reflects the ongoing relationship between God and His people, where God provides guidance and assurance. This divine interaction is consistent with other instances in the Old Testament where God speaks to His leaders, such as Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3) and Samuel in the temple (1 Samuel 3).<p><b>Do not be afraid of them</b><br>God's command to not fear is a recurring theme in Scripture, often given to leaders facing overwhelming odds. This assurance is rooted in God's sovereignty and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>, where Moses tells Israel to be strong and courageous. The command addresses the natural human tendency towards fear in the face of formidable enemies, reminding believers of God's power and presence.<p><b>for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel</b><br>This promise of victory underscores God's control over the outcome of battles. It reflects the covenant relationship where God fights for Israel, as seen in previous victories like the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>). The specific timing ("by this time tomorrow") highlights God's precise orchestration of events, reinforcing trust in His promises.<p><b>You are to hamstring their horses</b><br>Hamstringing horses was a military strategy to incapacitate the enemy's cavalry, ensuring they could not be used again in battle. This action reflects a reliance on God's power rather than military might, as horses and chariots were symbols of strength in ancient warfare (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). It also aligns with God's instructions to not accumulate horses, which could lead to reliance on human strength (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).<p><b>and burn up their chariots</b><br>Burning chariots further symbolizes the destruction of the enemy's military capabilities. Chariots were advanced war technology, and their destruction signifies the futility of human power against God's will. This act serves as a reminder of God's supremacy and the importance of obedience to His commands, as seen in the destruction of Jericho (Joshua 6). It also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who triumphs not by earthly power but through sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provides guidance and assurance to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy_kings_and_armies.htm">The Enemy Kings and Armies</a></b><br>A coalition of Canaanite kings and their armies who oppose Israel's conquest of the land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_and_chariots.htm">Horses and Chariots</a></b><br>Symbols of military power and strength in ancient warfare, representing the might of the enemy forces.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are in the process of conquering the Promised Land as part of God's covenant promise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Just as God assured Joshua of victory, believers today can trust in God's promises and His faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_fear.htm">Overcoming Fear</a></b><br>God's command to Joshua not to fear is a reminder that fear can be overcome by faith in God's power and plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_strategy.htm">Divine Strategy</a></b><br>God's instruction to hamstring the horses and burn the chariots teaches reliance on divine strategy rather than human strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's control over the events of history and His ability to deliver His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The physical battle faced by Joshua can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual battles, where believers are called to rely on God's strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Joshua_11_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Joshua 11:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_11_6_God_s_battle_sovereignty.htm">How does Joshua 11:6 demonstrate God's sovereignty in battle situations?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_from_God_s_command_2.htm">What can we learn about obedience from God's command to Joshua in this verse?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Joshua_11_6_to_Deut_31_6_promises.htm">How does Joshua 11:6 connect with God's promises in Deuteronomy 31:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Use_Do_not_be_afraid_daily.htm">How can we apply "Do not be afraid" to our daily challenges today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_trusting_God_s_timing.htm">What role does faith play in trusting God's timing as seen in Joshua 11:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/God_s_role_in_war_in_Joshua_11_6.htm">How does Joshua 11:6 reflect God's role in warfare and violence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Joshua_11_6_on_divine_aid_in_conflicts.htm">What does Joshua 11:6 reveal about divine intervention in human conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_God_s_command_in_Joshua_11_6.htm">How should believers interpret God's command to hamstring horses in Joshua 11:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_joshua_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Joshua 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_disable_horses,_god.htm">Why did God instruct Israelites to disable horses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'set_your_mind_above'_mean.htm">Why did God instruct Israelites to disable horses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_did_israelites_defeat_allied_armies.htm">How could the Israelites quickly overwhelm multiple allied armies, as described in Joshua 11:1&#8211;5? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_is_rahab_saved_by_faith_and_works.htm">Why does Hebrews 11:31 say Rahab was saved 'by faith,' while James 2:25 says she was saved by her 'works'?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Joshua 11:6 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD said to Joshua</b><p>God Himself initiates the strategy.

The encouragement was not unnecessary. The task before Joshua was harder than any that had yet befallen him. The enemy was far more numerous and better equipped. And it is a well known fact that men of tried courage are often daunted by unaccustomed dangers. Therefore all Joshua's strength of mind was required to inspirit even men who had experienced God's wonderful support at the passing of the Jordan, at the siege of Jericho, at the battle before Gibeon, now that they were face to face with the unwonted spectacle of a vast host, furnished with all the best munitions of war known to that age. The Israelites had nothing to depend upon but their own tried valour, and the reliance they felt upon God's support. "Unequal in arms and tactics," says Ewald ('Hist. Israel.,' 2:2. C.), "they could oppose to the Canaanites only courage and confidence." <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow about this time.</span> The promise was made on the eve of the encounter, but not, of course, as some have supposed, while Joshua was still at Gilgal. We are not told how long Joshua was on the march. Probably (as in ch. 2.) he had sent scouts forward, who brought him intelligence on the day before the battle of the vastness of the host, and the formidable nature of its equipment. The martial spirit Joshua had infused into the host, and the spirit of faith in God begotten of His recent acts of favour, contrast remarkably with the conduct of the Israelites described in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. To each servant of God His own special gift is vouchsafed. Moses was the man to inspire the Israelites with a reverence for law. Joshua had the special aptitudes for the leader in a campaign. It is a confirmation of this view that, in the one successful engagement recorded during the forty years' wandering in the desert, Joshua, not Moses, was the leader of the troops, while the aged law giver remained at a distance, encouraging them by his prayers (see <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>). But while we thus regard the secondary influences of individual character, we must not forget that the Israelites were also sustained at this moment by the assurances of Divine protection given at Jericho, at Ai, at Beth-horon, which had not been vouchsafed to them while under Moses's leadership in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Will I deliver up.</span> The "I" in the original is emphatic. And the use of the present participle in the Hebrew adds vividness to the promise. <span class="cmt_word">Slain</span>. LXX. and Vulg., <span class="accented">wounded.. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou shalt hough their horses.</span> To hough (or <span class="accented">hoxe</span>, Wiclif) is to <span class="accented">hamstring</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., to cut the sinews behind the hoofs, the <span class="accented">hocks</span>, as they are called. This rendered the horse useless, for the sinew could not reunite. The effects of the horses and chariots upon the mind of Joshua and his host, who had neither, is here traceable. "Those very horses and chariots, which seem to you so formidable, will I, the Lord of hosts, be tomorrow at this time delivering into your hand. The horses shall be forever useless to your enemies, and the dreaded chariots shall cease to be." Why should Joshua have destroyed the horses? Perhaps (as Keil, following Calvin, suggests) in order that the Israelites should not put their trust in chariots or in horses (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but in God alone (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). But more obvious considerations of policy may have dictated the measure. God never (see <a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-7</a>) makes use of supernatural means when natural ones are sufficient. Now the Israelites were unacquainted with the use of horses in warfare, while their enemies were not. To retain the horses while the country was as yet unsubdued would have been a double burden to them, for they would have had not <span class="accented">only</span> to keep them themselves, but to prevent the enemy from regaining them. On the same principle in modern warfare do we spike guns we cannot carry off, and destroy provisions we cannot convert to our own use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
