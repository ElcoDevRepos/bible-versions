The division of this tribe into two halves is significant, as it reflects the allocation of land on both sides of the Jordan River. This division is a fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>, where Ephraim and Manasseh are given prominence among the tribes.<p><b>along with the Reubenites and Gadites</b><br>The tribes of Reuben and Gad, along with half of Manasseh, chose to settle east of the Jordan River. This decision is recorded in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, where these tribes requested land suitable for their large herds. Their choice reflects a pastoral lifestyle and a preference for the fertile lands of Gilead and Bashan.<p><b>had received the inheritance Moses had given them</b><br>Moses, as the leader of Israel, allocated these lands before his death. This inheritance was a result of negotiations and agreements made during Israel's wilderness journey. It underscores the importance of Moses' leadership and the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs regarding the land.<p><b>beyond the Jordan to the east</b><br>This phrase refers to the Transjordan region, which includes territories such as Gilead and Bashan. The area is historically significant, as it was a buffer zone between Israel and other ancient Near Eastern powers. Archaeological findings in this region reveal a rich history of settlement and conflict.<p><b>just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them</b><br>Moses is frequently referred to as the "servant of the LORD," highlighting his role as a faithful leader and mediator of God's covenant. His assignment of the land was not arbitrary but divinely guided, reflecting God's sovereign plan for the nation of Israel. This allocation also prefigures the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>This refers to one of the two divisions of the tribe of Manasseh, a son of Joseph.

Half settled west of the Jordan with their Ephraimite brothers, while this &#8220;other half&#8221; had already settled east. The verse signals that God&#8217;s promise to give Israel the land (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) is being carried out tribe by tribe, even when a tribe is divided.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the Reubenites and Gadites</b><p>Reuben and Gad asked Moses for pastureland east of the Jordan because it suited their large herds (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>). Moses granted the request on condition they first help the rest of Israel conquer Canaan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20-22</a>). <a href="/joshua/1-12.htm">Joshua 1:12-16</a> records their pledge to keep that promise. Their mention here links back to their earlier commitment and shows it was honored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had received the inheritance Moses had given them</b><p>&#8220;Inheritance&#8221; points to land as a gift, not a mere conquest prize (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-38.htm">Deuteronomy 4:38</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-44.htm">Psalm 105:44</a>). Moses personally allocated these eastern territories (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12-17</a>), so Joshua&#8217;s narrative begins where Moses left off. This transition underlines continuity of leadership and of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beyond the Jordan to the east</b><p>&#8220;Beyond&#8221; places these tribes in the Transjordan&#8212;Gilead, Bashan, and the plains of Moab (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1-6</a>). Though outside what many picture as the &#8220;Promised Land,&#8221; Scripture treats this region as fully part of Israel&#8217;s God-given possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-18.htm">Deuteronomy 3:18-20</a>). It became a strategic buffer against eastern enemies (<a href="/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Moses the servant of the LORD had assigned to them</b><p>The phrase stresses obedience to divinely authorized instruction.

Joshua affirms that no change is needed; what Moses arranged stands (<a href="/joshua/22-1.htm">Joshua 22:1-4</a>). This reinforces the reliability of God&#8217;s Word and of the leaders He appoints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a> records that the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh, together with Reuben and Gad, already possessed their God-given inheritance east of the Jordan, exactly as Moses had directed.
