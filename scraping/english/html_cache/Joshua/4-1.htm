This event parallels the earlier crossing of the Red Sea, signifying God's continued faithfulness and miraculous provision. The crossing of the Jordan is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The Jordan River, at this time, was at flood stage, making the crossing even more miraculous (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). This event also serves as a type of baptism, symbolizing a transition from the old life in the wilderness to a new life in the Promised Land.<p><b>the LORD said to Joshua</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD to Joshua emphasizes Joshua's role as the divinely appointed leader of Israel, succeeding Moses. This divine guidance underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands for successful leadership and conquest. Joshua's leadership is a type of Christ, as both lead their people into a promised inheritance. The LORD's instructions to Joshua often involve specific, strategic commands that require faith and trust in God's plan, reflecting the necessity of divine guidance in achieving God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_nation_of_israel.htm">The Whole Nation of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical landmark that the Israelites crossed miraculously, symbolizing a transition from the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who guides and instructs His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/crossing_the_jordan.htm">Crossing the Jordan</a></b><br>A miraculous event where God stopped the flow of the river, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_transition.htm">God's Faithfulness in Transition</a></b><br>Just as God was faithful to Israel in crossing the Jordan, He is faithful to us in our life transitions.

God&#8217;s promise to bring His people into the land is visibly fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Whole nation&#8221; underscores unity. Not one tribe or family remained behind, echoing how God rescued the &#8220;entire host&#8221; through the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-29.htm">Exodus 14:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; The crossing itself&#8212;on dry ground (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>)&#8212;reveals God&#8217;s power to halt nature for His covenant people, just as He once divided the sea (<a href="/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Finishing the crossing sets the stage for memorializing the miracle with twelve stones (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2&#8211;7</a>). God completes works before calling His people to remember them.<p>&#8226; The wording highlights orderly obedience. Israel moved only when the priests bearing the ark led (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3&#8211;4</a>). Divine order replaces forty years of wilderness wandering caused by disbelief (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; By finishing first, the people are prepared for fresh instruction and renewed commitment, paralleling how Jesus clears the way before commanding His followers (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD said to Joshua</b><p>&#8226; Once the people are secure, God turns to His appointed leader. Joshua hears personal direction, just as Moses did (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>). Leadership begins and ends with listening to the Lord.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;the LORD said&#8221; signals authoritative revelation. Joshua&#8217;s forthcoming orders about the memorial stones (<a href="/joshua/4-2.htm">Joshua 4:2&#8211;3</a>) are not human ideas but divine commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s timing is perfect: instruction follows obedience. After Israel steps out in faith, He provides the next step&#8212;an enduring pattern seen with Abram (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1&#8211;4</a>) and Peter (<a href="/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The intimate dialogue affirms Joshua&#8217;s role as Moses&#8217; successor (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7&#8211;8</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness to speak did not cease with Moses&#8217; death; His presence continues with Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The combination of national participation and personal leadership points forward to Christ, who both shepherds the multitude (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14&#8211;16</a>) and equips individual servants (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a> records a pivotal moment: every Israelite stands safely in the Promised Land, proof of God&#8217;s faithful power. Only after the nation&#8217;s obedience does the Lord speak fresh direction to Joshua, underscoring that divine guidance meets completed trust. The verse teaches that God brings His people fully through obstacles, unifies them in purpose, and then calls attentive leaders to preserve the memory of His mighty acts for generations to come.THE MEMORIAL. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
