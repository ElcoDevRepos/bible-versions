The Israelites were often tempted to turn away from God, as seen in the cycles of sin and repentance throughout the Book of Judges. This warning is consistent with the covenantal language found in Deuteronomy, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience.<p><b>and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you</b><br>The nations referred to are the Canaanite peoples who were not fully driven out of the Promised Land. Clinging to these nations implies adopting their practices and gods, which was strictly forbidden (<a href="/exodus/23-32.htm">Exodus 23:32-33</a>). This phrase underscores the danger of syncretism and the dilution of Israel's distinct identity as God's chosen people. Historically, the Israelites struggled with this, as seen in the accounts of Solomon's reign, where foreign influences led to idolatry.<p><b>and if you intermarry</b><br>Intermarriage with the Canaanites was prohibited because it often led to the worship of foreign gods (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This was not a racial issue but a spiritual one, as the primary concern was the preservation of Israel's covenant relationship with God. The story of King Solomon, who married many foreign women and subsequently turned to their gods, serves as a cautionary tale (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p><b>and associate with them</b><br>Association with the remaining nations involved more than just social interaction; it implied forming alliances and adopting their cultural and religious practices. This was a direct threat to the purity of Israel's worship and obedience to God. The prophets frequently condemned such associations, as they often led to Israel's downfall and exile (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>). The call to be separate is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses, delivering a farewell address to the Israelites in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being warned by Joshua about the dangers of turning away from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The remaining nations in the Promised Land, representing potential sources of idolatry and sin for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/intermarriage.htm">Intermarriage</a></b><br>A specific concern for Joshua, as it could lead to the Israelites adopting pagan practices and turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Compromise with ungodly influences can lead to spiritual decline.

Turning from God starts subtly&#8212;first a backward glance, then a tight embrace of the surrounding culture, a tolerance of lingering influences, and finally alliances that capture the heart.
