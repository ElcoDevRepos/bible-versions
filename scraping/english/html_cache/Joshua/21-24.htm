It is historically significant as the site of a major battle where Joshua commanded the sun to stand still (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>). This city served as a strategic location due to its position in the Aijalon Valley, which was a key route for trade and military movements. The name Aijalon means "place of deer," reflecting the area's natural environment. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a fortified city, indicating its importance in the region.<p><b>and Gath-rimmon</b><br>Gath-rimmon was another Levitical city, also within the territory of Dan. The name means "winepress of the pomegranate," suggesting the area's agricultural productivity. It was one of the cities given to the Kohathite Levites, who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary. This allocation underscores the importance of providing for the Levites, who had no inheritance of their own. The city's location is less certain today, but it was likely near the Philistine border, indicating a role in the defense against Philistine incursions.<p><b>four cities</b><br>The mention of "four cities" refers to the total number of Levitical cities allocated in this passage. These cities were part of a larger network of 48 cities given to the Levites throughout Israel. This distribution ensured that the Levites, who were responsible for religious instruction and maintaining the worship of Yahweh, were present throughout the land. It reflects the integration of spiritual leadership within the community, emphasizing the importance of religious observance in daily life.<p><b>together with their pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands with the cities provided the Levites with the means to sustain themselves and their families. Since the Levites did not receive a tribal inheritance of land, these pasturelands were essential for their livestock and agricultural needs. This provision highlights the practical aspects of God's law, ensuring that those dedicated to His service were adequately supported. It also symbolizes the spiritual nourishment that the Levites were to provide to the people, just as the pasturelands provided physical sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aijalon.htm">Aijalon</a></b><br>A city allocated to the Levites within the territory of the tribe of Dan.

Earlier, <a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12&#8211;14</a> recounts how Joshua chased the Amorite kings through Aijalon&#8217;s valley, a reminder that this place had already witnessed God&#8217;s dramatic intervention.<p>&#8226; By placing a Levitical city here, the Lord situated His ministers right where past victories had proven His power. That physical geography becomes a spiritual memory marker, underscoring God&#8217;s faithfulness. See also <a href="/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a> for its repeated inclusion among sacred allotments.<p>&#8226; The Danites never fully secured their territory (<a href="/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), so Levites in Aijalon served as a living testimony amid incomplete obedience&#8212;calling the tribe back to covenant loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gath-rimmon</b><p>&#8226; The second town, &#8220;Gath-rimmon,&#8221; also lies within Dan&#8217;s inheritance (<a href="/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>). Its name speaks of a former Philistine presence, yet God turns enemy ground into ministry ground.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-69.htm">1 Chronicles 6:69</a> repeats its Levitical identity, reinforcing that worship is meant to flourish even on the fringe of hostile cultures (compare <a href="/1_samuel/5-1.htm">1 Samuel 5:1</a> where Philistine &#8220;Gath&#8221; appears).<p>&#8226; By pairing Gath-rimmon with Aijalon, <a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a> shows the Levites were strategically positioned&#8212;one city inland, the other closer to Philistine borders&#8212;so the truth of God&#8217;s law could permeate every corner of Dan&#8217;s territory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Four cities</b><p>&#8226; The verse closes a short list that began in <a href="/joshua/21-23.htm">Joshua 21:23</a>: &#8220;Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon&#8212;four cities.&#8221; The specific count matters. Just as previous tribes counted six Levitical towns (<a href="/joshua/21-22.htm">Joshua 21:22</a>), Dan is accountable for its full share. Nothing is left vague; God numbers His provisions (compare <a href="/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The precision underscores that every tribe, even one struggling like Dan, must tangibly support the worship of Yahweh. This mirrors Paul&#8217;s later appeal for material support of gospel workers (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; Each city came &#8220;with their pasturelands,&#8221; a phrase repeated throughout <a href="/bsb/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a> (vv. 2, 3, 12, etc.). These open fields were essential for grazing the Levites&#8217; flocks, providing daily sustenance so they could devote themselves to teaching and sacrificial service (<a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Levitical pasturelands were permanent and could not be sold off (<a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a>), protecting a stable spiritual infrastructure for generations.<p>&#8226; By tying land provision to ministry, the Lord illustrates that practical care and spiritual care go hand in hand&#8212;a principle echoed in <a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a> when the early church organized daily distribution so the apostles could focus on prayer and the Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a> records more than a geographical footnote; it highlights God&#8217;s meticulous care in planting His servants where their witness was most needed. Aijalon recalls past victories, Gath-rimmon confronts present challenges, the count of &#8220;four cities&#8221; confirms full tribal responsibility, and the accompanying pasturelands guarantee ongoing provision. Together, they reveal a faithful God who equips His people&#8212;both ministers and tribes&#8212;to honor Him in every place and season.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Aijalon,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ay&#183;y&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_357.htm">Strong's 357: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aijalon -- 'deer', the name of several cities in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Gath-rimmon&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(rim&#183;m&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1667.htm">Strong's 1667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gath-rimmon -- 'wine press of a pomegranate', two places in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">four</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_702.htm">Strong's 702: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cities,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Direct object marker<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their pasturelands.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7713;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/21-24.htm">OT History: Joshua 21:24 Aijalon with its suburbs Gath Rimmon (Josh.
