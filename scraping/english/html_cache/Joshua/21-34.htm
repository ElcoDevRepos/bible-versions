The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, they were given specific cities to dwell in. The Merarites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's structure, including the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. This allocation of cities reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to provide for the Levites, ensuring they had places to live and serve among the other tribes.<p><b>From the tribe of Zebulun they were given Jokneam, Kartah,</b><br>Zebulun was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's son Zebulun. The tribe's territory was located in the northern part of Canaan, which is modern-day Israel. Jokneam is identified with the archaeological site of Tel Yokneam, located near Mount Carmel. It was a strategically important city due to its location on the ancient trade route known as the Via Maris. Kartah's exact location is less certain, but it was within the territory of Zebulun. The allocation of these cities to the Merarites ensured that the Levites were distributed throughout the land, allowing them to perform their religious duties and influence the spiritual life of the nation. This distribution also symbolizes the integration of worship and daily life, as the Levites were present in various regions to teach and guide the people in the ways of the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_naphtali.htm">Tribe of Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.

Earlier in <a href="/bsb/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>, the Kohathites and Gershonites received their towns; now the spotlight turns to this final Levitical branch. God made sure every Levite group had a specific inheritance of cities, underscoring His faithfulness to all His servants (<a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226;Their duties included caring for the tabernacle&#8217;s heavy framework&#8212;beams, pillars, bases (<a href="/numbers/4-31.htm">Numbers 4:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226;The allocation of cities freed them from agricultural concerns so they could focus on worship service (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226;The verse&#8217;s opening reminds readers that God&#8217;s provision is intentional and complete, reaching even &#8220;the rest&#8221; who might seem overlooked (<a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The rest of the Levites</b><p>The phrase clarifies that the Merarites were the remaining Levites still awaiting their assignment (<a href="/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20-33</a> records the earlier distributions). God&#8217;s orderliness is visible: no tribe or clan is forgotten, reflecting His character of justice and care (<a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>).<p>&#8226;This distribution fulfills the divine command first given in <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>.<p>&#8226;It also fulfills the promise Moses relayed in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10-11</a> that the tribes would support the Levites.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were given</b><p>The inheritance is a gift, not a land-grab. &#8220;The priests and Levites&#8230; shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-2</a>).

Each tribe&#8217;s land ultimately belongs to the Lord (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>), so sharing it with the Levites cements national solidarity.<p>&#8226;<a href="/genesis/49-13.htm">Genesis 49:13</a> had foretold prosperity for Zebulun; now that blessing spills over to the Levites.<p>&#8226;Zebulun&#8217;s cooperation fulfills <a href="/numbers/35-8.htm">Numbers 35:8</a>: the larger tribes give more cities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jokneam</b><p>&#8220;Jokneam in Carmel&#8221; was once a Canaanite stronghold conquered by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/12-22.htm">Joshua 12:22</a>).

The Merarites, once burden-bearers of the tabernacle, receive Jokneam and Kartah from Zebulun&#8217;s territory. This gift demonstrates the Lord&#8217;s meticulous care, Israel&#8217;s covenant unity, and the transformation of conquered land into centers of worship.
