It reflects the continuity of divine guidance from Moses to Joshua, as seen in <a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1:1-9</a>, where God commissions Joshua. This divine communication underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>&#8220;Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.&#8221;</b><br>The "reproach of Egypt" refers to the disgrace or shame associated with Israel's past slavery and the subsequent wandering in the wilderness. This moment marks a significant transition from the old life of bondage to a new life in the Promised Land. The act of "rolling away" symbolizes a fresh start and the fulfillment of God's promises. This can be connected to the New Testament concept of believers being freed from the bondage of sin through Christ (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.</b><br>The name "Gilgal" is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "to roll." This location becomes significant as the first campsite of the Israelites in the Promised Land, serving as a base for their operations in Canaan. Gilgal is mentioned multiple times in the book of Joshua and later in the Old Testament, indicating its ongoing importance. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the beginning of a new chapter for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who leads and guides His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, successor to Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who have been delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now entering the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing sin and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River, named for the rolling away of the "reproach of Egypt."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance.htm">God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Just as God rolled away the reproach of Egypt from the Israelites, He delivers us from the bondage of sin through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/new_beginnings.htm">New Beginnings</a></b><br>Gilgal represents a new beginning for the Israelites.
