God provided through the worship of His people, illustrating divine faithfulness.<p>&#8226; The priesthood signified intimacy with God; access to His presence was their true treasure (<a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>). In the new covenant, believers share a similar spiritual inheritance (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5, 9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; These tribes requested land east of the Jordan because it suited their large herds (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses granted the request conditionally: they must first help their brothers conquer Canaan (<a href="/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-12.htm">Joshua 1:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Their early allotment demonstrates both God&#8217;s flexibility in meeting genuine needs and His insistence on unity among the tribes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;That Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights Moses as God&#8217;s faithful mediator (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>).

Thus, not so much the area of the land, as the size and importance of its cities, was to be the leading principle of the division. And not unwisely. The Israelites were about to relinquish their nomad life, and if they settled in Palestine, how, without walled cities, could they hold their own against the powerful nations round about them? <span class="cmt_word">And came again to Joshua.</span> "The result of this examination, which was unquestionably a more careful one than that made by the spies of Moses, was that the unsubdued territory was found to be too small for the wants of seven tribes, while that apportioned to Judah was seen to be disproportionately large. To remedy this difficulty a place was found for Benjamin between Judah and Ephraim, and the portion of Simeon was taken out of the southern portion of Judah, while both Judah and Ephraim had to give up some cities to Dan" (Ritter). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Levites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lal&#183;w&#238;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
