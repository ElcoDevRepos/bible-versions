The allocation of cities to the Levites was not a human decision but a directive from God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His direct involvement in the affairs of Israel. The command underscores the importance of following God's instructions, as seen throughout the Pentateuch, where obedience to God's commands is a central theme (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>).<p><b>the Israelites gave the Levites</b><br>The Levites were set apart for religious duties and did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Instead, they were given cities within the territories of other tribes. This arrangement highlights the communal responsibility of the Israelites to support the Levites, who served as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle. This system ensured that the Levites were integrated into the community, fostering spiritual guidance and teaching among the people.<p><b>these cities and their pasturelands</b><br>The cities provided to the Levites included surrounding pasturelands for their livestock, ensuring their sustenance. This provision reflects the practical needs of the Levites, who relied on the community for their livelihood. The inclusion of pasturelands also indicates a concern for the well-being of the Levites, allowing them to maintain their flocks and herds. This arrangement is reminiscent of God's provision for His people, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>out of their own inheritance</b><br>The phrase underscores the sacrificial nature of the Israelites' gift to the Levites. Each tribe gave from their own allotted land, demonstrating a willingness to share their inheritance for the sake of supporting the religious leaders. This act of giving is a model of generosity and communal responsibility, reflecting the principle of stewardship found throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the church supporting its ministers (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The collective descendants of Jacob, also known as the children of Israel, who were given the Promised Land as their inheritance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service to God.

In literal history and in ongoing principle, God&#8217;s people receive His blessings not merely to enjoy them, but to steward them for the sake of worship, teaching, and mercy throughout the community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of their inheritance.</span> Out of that of Israel (see note on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">These cities.</span> The number was forty-eight, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, four times twelve. Bahr ('Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 1:221) remarks on the symbolical meaning of this number. He compares it, first, to the twelve tribes marching in four detachments, the ark of God and its guard in the centre (see <a href="/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.). Four, he says, is the number of the world, and three the sign of God, and twelve of the combination of the two. Thus we are reminded of the heavenly city which "lieth four-square," which has "twelve foundations of precious stones," "twelve gates of pearls, and at the gates twelve angels," and the names of "the twelve tribes of Israel" written thereupon, and wherein was "the tree of life," with its "twelve manner of fruits," which were "yielded every month" (<a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14, 16, 19, 21</a>;
