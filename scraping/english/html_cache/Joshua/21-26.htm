The inclusion of pasturelands highlights the practical needs of the Levites, who required land for their livestock. This allocation reflects the broader biblical principle of God's provision for His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>, where God provides a ram for Abraham. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order in Scripture, as seen in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20).<p><b>were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descendants of Levi's son Kohath. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4-15</a>). This allocation to the "rest" of the Kohathite clans distinguishes them from the descendants of Aaron, who received separate allocations due to their priestly duties. This division underscores the organized structure of Israelite society and the specific roles assigned to different groups, reflecting the orderliness of God's covenant community. The Levites' inheritance of cities rather than a contiguous land area fulfills Jacob's prophecy in <a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>, where Levi's descendants are scattered in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites, descendants of Kohath, the second son of Levi.

Ten represents a sizable share without rivaling the territorial allotments of the other tribes; it&#8217;s a practical demonstration that the Levites&#8217; inheritance is not in land size but in priestly service (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter, verses 4&#8211;5 mention thirteen cities for the primary Kohathite line of Aaronic priests. Verse 26 now records the additional allotment for the rest of the Kohathites, totaling twenty&#8208;three cities for the whole Kohathite branch (see <a href="/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a>).<p>&#8226; The precision counters any notion of random distribution: God orders His people meticulously (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>, &#8220;For God is not a God of disorder but of peace,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Together with their pasturelands</b><p>&#8226; Pasturelands were essential for the Levites&#8217; animals, which, in turn, were needed for temple service and personal sustenance. <a href="/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2&#8211;5</a> lays out exact measurements for these green belts, ensuring the Levites could live near but not dominate the agricultural economy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm">Leviticus 25:34</a> highlights that these open lands were never to be sold; they remained &#8220;permanent possession&#8221; for the Levites, underscoring God&#8217;s long-term provision.<p>&#8226; The mention of pasturelands also reminds us that ministry requires material support; God sees to both spiritual and physical needs (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Given&#8221; stresses grace. The Kohathites did nothing to earn these cities; they simply received them as part of their covenant role (<a href="/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;rest&#8221; of the Kohathites refers to those non-Aaronic families descended from Kohath&#8212;Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites (<a href="/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27</a>). While Aaron&#8217;s line served at the altar, these clans assisted in tabernacle duties (<a href="/numbers/4-1.htm">Numbers 4:1&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Placement of these cities in Ephraim, Dan, and western Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20&#8211;26</a>) strategically located Levitical influence across Israel&#8217;s heartland, promoting teaching and worship throughout the nation (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8&#8211;9</a> shows later Levites still performing this task).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26</a> records the final tally for the non-Aaronic Kohathites: ten cities with surrounding pasturelands. Each phrase showcases God&#8217;s meticulous faithfulness&#8212;completing His word, providing exact portions, meeting practical needs, and distributing spiritual caretakers throughout Israel. The verse is a snapshot of covenant grace expressed in real estate, cattle fields, and priestly service, assuring today&#8217;s reader that the Lord still completes, numbers, supplies, and assigns for the good of His people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/21-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Altogether</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ten</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1430;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;&#347;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6235.htm">Strong's 6235: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with their pasturelands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#7713;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;hen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4054.htm">Strong's 4054: </a> </span><span class="str2">A suburb, the area around a, building, the margin of the sea</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[were given] to the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3498.htm">Strong's 3498: </a> </span><span class="str2">To jut over, exceed, to excel, to remain, be left, to leave, cause to abound, preserve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Kohathite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6955.htm">Strong's 6955: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kohath -- a son of Levi</span><br /><br /><span class="word">clans.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4940.htm">Strong's 4940: </a> </span><span class="str2">A family, circle of relatives, a class, a species, sort, a tribe, people</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joshua/21-26.htm">Joshua 21:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joshua/21-26.htm">OT History: Joshua 21:26 All the cities of the families (Josh.
