It is located in the hill country of Ephraim, a central region in the land of Israel. Shechem was the first place where Abraham built an altar to the Lord after entering Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>). It later became a city of refuge, a place where those who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). This reflects God's provision for justice and mercy within the Israelite legal system. Theologically, Shechem is a place of covenant renewal, as seen when Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel there to renew their covenant with God (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). The location in Ephraim, a prominent tribe, underscores its centrality in Israel's spiritual and political life.<p><b>(a city of refuge for the manslayer)</b><br>The concept of cities of refuge is introduced in <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a>. These cities provided protection for individuals who accidentally killed someone, preventing the avenger of blood from taking revenge until a fair trial could be conducted. This system highlights the balance between justice and mercy in God's law. Theologically, cities of refuge can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers refuge and salvation to sinners seeking forgiveness and protection from the consequences of sin. The manslayer's need for refuge parallels humanity's need for salvation through Jesus.<p><b>Gezer</b><br>Gezer was another city allocated to the Levites, located in the Shephelah region of Judah. It was strategically important due to its position on the route between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Archaeological excavations have uncovered significant remains, including fortifications and a water system, indicating its historical importance. Gezer's inclusion among the Levitical cities emphasizes the widespread distribution of the Levites throughout Israel, ensuring their presence and influence in both spiritual and practical matters. Historically, Gezer was a Canaanite city that was later conquered by Pharaoh and given as a dowry to Solomon's wife (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>), illustrating the complex interactions between Israel and surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A significant city in biblical history, Shechem was designated as a city of refuge.
