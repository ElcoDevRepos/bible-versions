The "hornet" is often interpreted as a metaphor for fear or panic that God instilled in the hearts of Israel's enemies, causing them to flee. This aligns with <a href="/exodus/23-28.htm">Exodus 23:28</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-20.htm">Deuteronomy 7:20</a>, where God promises to send hornets to drive out the Canaanites. The use of "hornet" symbolizes divine power and judgment, emphasizing that the victory was orchestrated by God rather than human effort.<p><b>and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you</b><br>The Amorite kings refer to the rulers of the Amorite tribes, who were significant adversaries in the land of Canaan. Historically, the Amorites were a powerful group in the ancient Near East, and their defeat was crucial for Israel's settlement in the Promised Land. This phrase highlights God's fulfillment of His promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where He assured the eventual displacement of the Amorites due to their iniquity. The specific mention of "two kings" likely refers to Sihon and Og, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>.<p><b>but not by your own sword or bow</b><br>This emphasizes that the Israelites' victories were not achieved through their military prowess but through divine intervention. It underscores the theme of reliance on God rather than human strength, a recurring motif throughout the Old Testament. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>, which states that the land was not gained by their sword, but by God's right hand and arm. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the importance of faith and obedience over reliance on human capabilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who is delivering his farewell address to the Israelites in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have been led into the Promised Land and are being reminded of God's faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorite_kings.htm">The Amorite Kings</a></b><br>The rulers of the Amorite people, who were inhabitants of the land before the Israelites took possession of it.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hornet.htm">The Hornet</a></b><br>A metaphorical or literal agent sent by God to drive out the enemies of Israel, emphasizing divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>Recognize that God often works in ways beyond human understanding or capability.

The mention of hornets in the prophecies in <a href="/exodus/23-28.htm">Exodus 23:28</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/7-20.htm">Deuteronomy 7:20</a> is not conclusive. In the former passage the hornet seems to be connected with the fear that was to be felt at their advance. The latter passage is not conclusive on either side. The probability is - since we have no mention of hornets in the history - that what is meant is that kind of unreasonable and panic fear which seems, to persons too far off to discern the assailants, to be displayed by persons attacked by these apparently insignificant insects. The image is a lively and natural one, and it well expresses the dismay which, as we read, seized the inhabitants of the land when their foes, formidable rather from Divine protection then from their number or warlike equipments, had crossed the Jordan (see <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>).
