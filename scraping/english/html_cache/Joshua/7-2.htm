Jericho was the first city conquered in the Promised Land, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His promises. The sending of men to Ai shows Joshua's strategic leadership and reliance on reconnaissance, a common military practice. Ai, meaning "ruin," was a smaller city compared to Jericho, suggesting a seemingly easier conquest. This action reflects the ongoing mission to claim the land God promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel</b><br>Beth-aven, meaning "house of wickedness," was located near Bethel, a significant site in Israel's history. Bethel, meaning "house of God," was where Jacob had his vision of the ladder (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). The proximity of Ai to these locations highlights the spiritual and historical significance of the area. The contrast between Beth-aven and Bethel underscores the spiritual battle between righteousness and wickedness, a recurring theme in Israel's journey.<p><b>and told them, &#8220;Go up and spy out the land.&#8221;</b><br>Joshua's command to spy out the land reflects a careful and prudent approach to warfare, similar to Moses sending spies into Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13:1-2</a>). This action demonstrates the importance of preparation and intelligence in fulfilling God's commands. It also shows Joshua's leadership style, which balances faith in God's promises with practical action. The phrase "go up" indicates the ascent from the Jordan Valley to the hill country, emphasizing the geographical challenges faced by the Israelites.<p><b>So the men went up and spied out Ai.</b><br>The obedience of the men to Joshua's command reflects the unity and discipline within the Israelite camp. Their mission to spy out Ai was crucial for understanding the city's defenses and planning the attack. This reconnaissance mission, however, would later reveal the consequences of Achan's sin, as the initial defeat at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-4.htm">Joshua 7:4-5</a>) serves as a reminder of the need for holiness and obedience to God. The act of spying also connects to the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s people being called to discern and understand the spiritual battles they face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading the people into the Promised Land.

But we may observe that the next step after the capture of Ai, before the further conquest of the country, was to set up the Ten Commandments in Mount Ebal, in the heart of the country, and to pronounce there the blessing and the curse which are the sanction of the law of God. It may well be that the course of the first military operations was directed to this end. The capture of Ai would put the Israelites in possession of the main road running north and south through Palestine, and enable them to reach the centre immediately. Thus the character of the war, which was no mere human enterprise, is maintained; and it is probable that the Divine reason for the movement is that which we are intended to observe. For the first mention of Ai, see <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm" title="And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 12:8</a>. It is noticeable that there Abram fitst pitched his tent after his return to Canaan out of Egypt. (See also on <a href="/joshua/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be you dismayed: take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:">Joshua 8:1</a>.) Note also that Beth-aven and Bethel are distinct, although adjacent, places. The one is not a later name of the other, as has been sometimes supposed, although one is "the house of vanity" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>perhaps of idols) and the other "the house of God."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ai</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> "the ruins" (cf.

It becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> in <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, and the feminine form is found in <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>. The latter, from the mention of Michmash in the route of Sennacherib immediately afterwards, is probably the same as Ai. Robinson and Hell - the former very doubtfully - place it at Turmus Aya, an eminence crowned with ruins above Deir Duwan. But Vandevelde contests this, and places it at Tell-el-Hajar, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Tell or heap of ruins; and G. Williams and Capt. Wilson have independently fixed on the same spot, though they call it et-Tel, or "the heap," and suppose the "el-Hajar" to have been added in answer to the question, "what heap?" This situation seems best to suit the requirements of the narrative. For it is "on the southern brow of the Wady-el-Mutyah" (Vandevelde), near that "wild entanglement of hill and valley at the head of the Wady Harith," which "climbs into the heart of the mountains of Benjamin till it meets the central ridge of the country at Bethel" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 202). Its situation, unlike that of Turmus Aya, is calculated to give cover to an ambush of 5,000 men, and it also answers to the conditions in its nearness to Michmash, from which Turmus Aya is more than three hours' journey distant. The Tell is "covered with heaps of ruins" (Capt. Wilson, 'Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement,' 4. p. 124). Conder, however ('Handbook,' p. 254), identifies Ai with Haiyan, two miles from Bethel, in the same Wady, but why, he gives no hint. A fortress so situated was one which Joshua could not leave in his rear, and so its capture was a matter of necessity. By its position, if not from the number of its inhabitants, it was necessarily a very strong one. Ai is mentioned as early as <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>, and we find that it was inhabited down to the Captivity, for the "men of Bethel and Ai" are mentioned (and, it may be observed, in close proximity to those of Rama, Geba, and Michmash - see <a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> above cited) in <a href="/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>. See also <a href="/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, above cited. The name Ai, or ruins, found so early, implies that the aboriginal inhabitants had built a city in that almost inaccessible situation. Lieut. Conder gives a very vivid description of the site et-Tel in 'Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement,' April, 1874. There are, he says, "huge mounds of broken stone and shingle ten feet high. The town," he adds, "must have been pounded small, and the fury of its destruction is still evidenced by its completeness." He continues: "The party for the ambush, following the ancient causeway from Bethel to Jordan (which we have recovered throughout its entire length) as far as Michmash, would then easily ascend the great wady west of Ai, and arrive within a quarter of a mile of the city without having ever come in sight of it. Here, hidden by the knoll of Burjums and the high ground near it, a force of almost any magnitude might wait unsuspected. The main body in the meanwhile, without diverging from the road, would ascend the gently sloping valley and appear before the town on the open battlefield which stretches away to its east and south. From the knoll the figure of Joshua would be plainly visible to either party, with his spear stretched against the sky" [see ch Joshua 8:18). But the site still eludes investigation. Lieut. Kitchener, Mr. Birch, Mr. Guest, would place it at Kh-Haiy, or the rock Rimmon. When those who have visited the country are so divided in opinion, nothing but silence remains for those who have not. <span class="cmt_word">Beth-avern</span> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23</a>). This place has not yet been identified. It was close by Ai, and not far from Bethel, as the transference of its name to Bethel by Hosea (Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5) shows. It could not have been a place of any importance, or the historian would not have found it necessary to explain where it was. Hosea has perhaps derived his knowledge of it from this passage. Some writers have identified it with Bethel. But this is obviously incorrect, since the literal rendering of the Hebrew here places Ai "in the immediate proximity of Beth-aven, <span class="accented">eastward</span> of Bethel." The LXX. omits all reference to Beth-aven. But there are many various readings. Bethel Formerly Luz (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>; <a href="/judges/1-23.htm">Judges 1:23</a>). The last-cited passage seems to prove that Bethel was not among, the cities taken during Joshua's campaign; though this is extraordinary in the face of the fact that the inhabitants of Luz gave their assistance to the men of Ai in the battle (see <a href="/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a>, where, however, it is remarkable that the LXX. omits all reference to Bethel). We may observe that there is no mention of the capture of Bethel, or the destruction of the inhabitants, and that this exactly agrees with <a href="/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22-26</a>. This is an undesigned coincidence well worthy of note. We may also remark on the exact conformity between the situation of Bethel as described here and in <a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>. The city to which the name Bethel was attached was not the place of Abraham's altar, as we learn from the passage just cited, but was in its immediate neighbourhood. The ruins which now mark its site are of a later date than the events recorded in Scripture. Its modern name is Beitin. <span class="cmt_word">Go up and view the country.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">spy</span> (or <span class="accented">reconnoitre</span>); literally, <span class="accented">foot</span> the country. Joshua does not refuse to avail himself of human expedients because he is under Divine guidance (see also ch. 2). The reasons for this reconnoitring expedition are made clear enough by the passage quoted from Lieut. Condor's survey above. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Meanwhile, Joshua</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
