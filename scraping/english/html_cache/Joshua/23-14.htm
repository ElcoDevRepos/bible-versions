It reflects the natural order of life and death, as seen in other biblical figures like David (<a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>). Joshua's acknowledgment of his mortality underscores the transient nature of human leadership and the enduring faithfulness of God.<p><b>and you know with all your heart and soul</b><br>This emphasizes the deep, internal conviction and understanding of the Israelites. The heart and soul together represent the entirety of one's being in Hebrew thought, indicating a comprehensive and sincere acknowledgment of God's faithfulness. This phrase calls the Israelites to remember and internalize their experiences of God's promises being fulfilled.<p><b>that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed</b><br>This statement highlights God's unwavering faithfulness to His covenant with Israel. The "good promises" refer to the blessings and victories promised to the Israelites, such as the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). This assurance of God's reliability is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, reinforcing the trustworthiness of His word.<p><b>Everything was fulfilled for you</b><br>This phrase confirms the complete realization of God's promises to Israel, particularly regarding the land and their victories over enemies. It serves as a testament to God's power and faithfulness, encouraging the Israelites to continue trusting in Him. This fulfillment is a precursor to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who embodies the completion of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>not one promise has failed</b><br>Reiterating the previous assurance, this phrase underscores the perfection and reliability of God's word. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His plans. This assurance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are reminded of the certainty of God's promises through Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). The unfailing nature of God's promises is a cornerstone of faith, providing hope and assurance to believers throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

This echoes Moses&#8217; own farewell emphasis in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2&#8211;6</a>, where he called Israel to &#8220;be strong and courageous.&#8221; It is as though Joshua is saying, &#8220;Pause, focus, and let these final truths sink in.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>today I am going the way of all the earth,</b><p>Joshua, like Moses before him (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>) and David after him (<a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>), acknowledges the universal reality of death. &#8220;All the earth&#8221; reminds us that no one outruns mortality (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Joshua&#8217;s calm acceptance highlights two truths:<p>&#8226; Life&#8217;s brevity underscores the urgency of obedience.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s work is larger than any single leader; He faithfully raises up servants generation after generation (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you know with all your heart and soul</b><p>Joshua appeals to their deepest convictions, not mere head knowledge.

Solomon will later echo, &#8220;Not one word has failed of all His good promises&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>). God&#8217;s character guarantees His word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Every &#8220;good promise&#8221; includes:<p>&#8226; Possession of the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Victory over enemies (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; His abiding presence (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.</b><p>Joshua doubles the statement for emphasis. The Israelites can look around and see Canaan conquered, allotments distributed (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43&#8211;45</a>), and cities of refuge established. This complete fulfillment previews the greater &#8220;Yes&#8221; that is found in Christ, in whom &#8220;every one of God&#8217;s promises is &#8216;Yes&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joshua&#8217;s farewell reminds us that leaders pass, yet God&#8217;s faithfulness never fades.
