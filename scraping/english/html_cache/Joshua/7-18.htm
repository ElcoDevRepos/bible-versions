The casting of lots was a common practice in ancient Israel to discern God's will (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The family of Zabdi is part of the tribe of Judah, highlighting the importance of tribal and familial identity in Israelite society. This process underscores the communal nature of sin and accountability within the covenant community.<p><b>and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,</b><br>Achan's lineage is traced back to Zerah, one of the sons of Judah and Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>). This connection to Judah, a prominent tribe, adds gravity to Achan's transgression. The tribe of Judah holds significant prophetic importance, as it is the tribe from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>). Achan's sin contrasts with the future righteousness expected from this tribe.<p><b>was selected</b><br>The selection of Achan reveals God's omniscience and justice. Despite the hidden nature of Achan's sin, it is brought to light, demonstrating that nothing is concealed from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This moment foreshadows the ultimate judgment where all will be revealed (<a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>).
