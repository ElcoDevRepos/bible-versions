The Israelites, having settled in the Promised Land, were vigilant about maintaining the purity of their worship and adherence to God's commands. Reports and communication were crucial in maintaining unity among the tribes, especially given the geographical separation of the Transjordan tribes.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</b><br>These tribes had chosen to settle on the eastern side of the Jordan River, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>. Their decision was based on the suitability of the land for their livestock. This separation, however, posed potential challenges for unity and religious fidelity, as they were physically distant from the central place of worship at Shiloh.<p><b>have built an altar</b><br>The construction of an altar was a significant act, as altars were central to worship and sacrifice in Israelite religion. According to <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>, sacrifices were to be made only at the place God chose, which was initially the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem. The building of another altar could be seen as a direct challenge to this command, raising concerns of idolatry or schism.<p><b>on the border of the land of Canaan,</b><br>This location is significant as it marks the boundary between the land of Canaan, where the majority of the Israelites settled, and the Transjordan area. The border was not just a physical demarcation but also a symbolic one, representing the division between the tribes and the potential for differing religious practices.<p><b>at Geliloth near the Jordan</b><br>Geliloth is a location near the Jordan River, which served as a natural boundary. The Jordan River was a significant geographical feature in Israel's history, symbolizing both a barrier and a point of transition, as seen in the crossing led by Joshua in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3-4</a>. The proximity to the Jordan suggests the altar was strategically placed to be visible and accessible to both sides.<p><b>on the Israelite side.&#8221;</b><br>This detail emphasizes that the altar was built within the territory considered part of the Promised Land, which heightened the concern among the other tribes. It suggested an assertion of religious independence or a potential breach of covenant, which could lead to divine judgment, as seen in previous instances of disobedience (e.g., the sin of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>). The unity and purity of worship were paramount, and any deviation was taken seriously by the Israelite community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Reubenites, Gadites, and the Half-Tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>These are the tribes that settled on the east side of the Jordan River.

The western tribes therefore remember that &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole lump&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a>) and feel compelled to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have built an altar</b><p>&#8226; Only one legitimate altar existed: the bronze altar before the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Any additional altar suggested a rival center of worship, forbidden because it could lead to idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier generations had erected memorial stones (<a href="/joshua/4-4.htm">Joshua 4:4&#8211;7</a>), but an altar carried sacrificial overtones; hence the alarm.<p>This report therefore sounds like potential rebellion, echoing <a href="/joshua/22-16.htm">Joshua 22:16</a>: &#8220;How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the border of the land of Canaan</b><p>The location heightens the tension. An altar placed exactly at the boundary might serve either of two purposes:<p>&#8226; To separate the eastern tribes spiritually from their western brothers, as Jeroboam later did at Dan and Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Or&#8212;to the minds of the builders&#8212;to serve as a witness of unity, guarding against future division (as the eastern delegation will explain in <a href="/joshua/22-24.htm">Joshua 22:24&#8211;27</a>).<p>At this point in the narrative, no one west of the Jordan knows which motive is true.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side</b><p>Geliloth (also called Gilgal in <a href="/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a>) lies on the western bank. That means the altar sits within Canaanite territory proper, not in the eastern allotments. Such placement appears especially provocative because it encroaches on land that belongs to the central worship center. In <a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1&#8211;8</a> the LORD specified the exact placement of His altar; any competing structure so near the covenant community&#8217;s heartland felt like an existential threat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/22-11.htm">Joshua 22:11</a> records a moment of impending conflict born out of zeal for covenant purity. The western tribes, hearing that their brothers have erected a new altar inside Canaan, assume the worst because God&#8217;s law allows only one altar for sacrifice and warns against divided worship. The careful wording&#8212;highlighting who built it, where they placed it, and how the news arrived&#8212;sets the stage for a confrontation that will ultimately reaffirm Israel&#8217;s unity and the sufficiency of the LORD&#8217;s prescribed worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Have built an altar.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">have built the altar. </span>As appears by <a href="/joshua/22-28.htm" title="Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.">Joshua 22:28</a>, it was a representation of the altar of Jehovah: a copy of the one altar which He had given to Israel for sacrifice. The design was to set up on the east of Jordan a likeness of that altar which was established on the west, that the tribes on the other side of Jordan might appeal to it as a proof that they also were the people of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Half tribe of Manasseh.</span> Throughout this part of the narrative, when the body politic, rather than the descent of the tribe, is to be indicated, we have, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>. See above, <a href="/joshua/13-29.htm">Joshua 13:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">An altar.</span> The original has the altar. <span class="cmt_word">Over against</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span>. It is difficult to fix the meaning of this expression. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> seems to have meant <span class="accented">the front</span> of anything, and therefore <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> would naturally mean <span class="accented">towards</span> the front of, or <span class="accented">in</span> front cf. Thus we have had the expression in <a href="/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a> (where see note), where it seems to mean, <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, and in <a href="/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>, where it seems to have the same meaning. With verbs of motion it signifies <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3</a>, and <a href="/1_samuel/17-30.htm">1 Samuel 17:30</a>. Here it clearly cannot be pressed to mean <span class="accented">across</span> Jordan. See note below. <span class="cmt_word">The borders of Jordan.</span> As above, ver. 10, the <span class="accented">circles</span> of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">At the passage of the children of Israel.</span> The word translated "the passage of," literally," unto over," has originally the sense of "across." Here, however, it means "<span class="accented">towards</span> <span class="accented">the region opposite to the sons of Israel," i.e., in the direction of</span> the country on the other side Jordan. The country across Jordan was usually designated as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> Jordan. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, the phrase used here, we find in <a href="/exodus/28-26.htm">Exodus 28:26</a>, apparently in the sense of <span class="accented">across</span> (so <a href="/exodus/39-19.htm">Exodus 39:19</a>). In <a href="/deuteronomy/30-13.htm">Deuteronomy 30:13</a> it is used of moving in the direction of a place, "across" or "over the sea." In <a href="/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9, 12</a>, with the addition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, the phrase means "straight forward." In <a href="/1_samuel/14-40.htm">1 Samuel 14:40</a> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means "on one side." In <a href="/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> means "over."
