The Amorites were a powerful group in the ancient Near East, often mentioned in the context of opposition to Israel. The defeat of Sihon is recounted in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a>, where Israel requested passage through his land, but Sihon refused and attacked, leading to his defeat. This victory was crucial for Israel as it secured the land east of the Jordan River, demonstrating God's faithfulness in delivering the promised land to His people.<p><b>who reigned in Heshbon</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of King Sihon and is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. It was strategically located on the King's Highway, an important trade route. The city's capture symbolized a significant military and spiritual victory for Israel. Heshbon's conquest is also referenced in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-37</a>, highlighting its importance in Israel's journey to the Promised Land. The city later became part of the territory allocated to the tribe of Reuben.<p><b>as far as the border of the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel. The border mentioned here delineates the extent of the territory taken from Sihon, which did not encroach upon the land of the Ammonites, as God had instructed Israel not to harass them (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). This boundary reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and the respect for the territorial limits He established for Israel and its neighbors.
