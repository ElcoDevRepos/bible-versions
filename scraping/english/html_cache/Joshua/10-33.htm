Accordingly, in spite of the alleged carelessness of our compiler, who is credited with having put together shreds of the various narratives in the most perfunctory manner, he takes care to add (<a href="/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>) that the inhabitants of Gezer were not driven out. In like manner, with the single exception of Hebron, the people of which must have at once chosen another king, he carefully omits the mention of the king in the cities which had lost their kings in the battle before Gibeon. See also note on ver. 32. Thus a careful examination of the narrative puts the care and accuracy of the history very carefully before us. With regard to the situation of Gezer, it has been accurately determined by the Palestine Exploration Society. The Levitical boundaries, with Greek and Hebrew inscriptions, signifying the boundary of Gezer, have been discovered by M. Ganneau (see 'Quarterly Paper' for October, 1874). Tell el Jezer was first identified by M. Ganneau with Gezer. Continuing his researches, he found on a slab of rock nearly horizontal and very nearly two inches in length a bilingual inscription, in Greek and Hebrew, signifying the limit of Gezer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>). Since the inscription is Greek and Talmudical in its character (the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> has not the signification of "limit" in the Hebrew Scriptures) it must, in spite of the early form of the letters, belong to a period long subsequent to the Babylonish captivity. M. Ganneau suggests the Maccabean period. (See below.) But it is, no doubt, the result of a remeasurement in accordance with the rules laid down in <a href="/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>. Some have supposed the above to have been designed to fix the limit of the sabbath day's journey. But it is more probable that it served as a boundary between the Levitical and the tribal territory, the more especially as the words are so placed as to be read by one <span class="accented">entering</span> the town. It was a Levitical city (<a href="/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/6-67.htm">1 Chronicles 6:67</a>), or at least assigned to the Levites; but <a href="/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a> shows that the Canaanitish population lived on with the Levites. It may have been the nondescript character of the population that caused it to fall an easy prey to Pharaoh (<a href="/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>, where note that the Canaanites had never been driven out); but when Solomon espoused his daughter he restored Gezer to Israel. Under the same name Gazara it plays a conspicuous part in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52; 2 Macc. 10:32). From the latter passage we learn that it was "a very strong hold." It retains its old name, being now known as Tell el Jezer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/10-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Horam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Horam -- a Canaanite king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Gezer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1494;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ge&#183;zer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1507.htm">Strong's 1507: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gezer -- 'portion', a Levitical city on the border of Ephraim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to help</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1494;&#1465;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#8216;&#183;z&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
