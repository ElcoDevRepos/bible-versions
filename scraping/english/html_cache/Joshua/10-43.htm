Joshua, as the leader of Israel, often led the people into battle and then returned to their base. This reflects the cyclical nature of conquest and rest in the narrative of the Israelites' journey into the Promised Land. It also highlights Joshua's role as a type of Christ, leading his people to victory and rest.<p><b>with all Israel</b><br>The inclusion of "all Israel" emphasizes the unity and collective effort of the tribes in the conquest of Canaan. It underscores the importance of communal participation in God's promises and commands. This unity is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>to the camp at Gilgal</b><br>Gilgal served as the base of operations for the Israelites during their conquest of Canaan. It was the first campsite after crossing the Jordan River and held significant religious and historical importance.
