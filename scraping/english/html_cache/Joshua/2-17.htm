The men are speaking to Rahab, a Canaanite woman who has provided them shelter. This interaction highlights the role of Rahab, who is later mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) and praised for her faith in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>. Her inclusion in the biblical narrative underscores the theme of God's grace extending beyond Israel to Gentiles.<p><b>We will not be bound by this oath</b><br>The spies are addressing the conditions under which they will honor the agreement made with Rahab. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oaths were solemn promises often invoking divine witnesses. The seriousness of oaths is emphasized throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, where it is stated that a man must not break his word. The spies' statement indicates that there are specific conditions that must be met for the oath to remain valid.<p><b>you made us swear</b><br>Rahab had requested an oath for the safety of her family in exchange for her assistance. This reflects the cultural practice of seeking covenants for protection and mutual benefit. The phrase also highlights Rahab's initiative and negotiation skills, which were crucial for her family's survival. The concept of swearing an oath is significant in biblical narratives, as seen in <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23-24</a>, where Abraham swears an oath to Abimelech. This underscores the importance of faithfulness and integrity in agreements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Two Israelite men sent by Joshua to scout the land of Jericho.

She has sheltered them, so they now respond with covenantal reassurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will not be bound</b><p>&#8211; The phrase underscores the conditional nature of their pledge. Yes, an oath has been sworn, but responsibility lies on both parties.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a> the binding power of a vow is emphasized, yet <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a> highlights that vows are voluntary; once made, they must be fulfilled.<p>&#8226; By stating &#8220;we will not be bound,&#8221; the spies affirm they take oaths seriously while making clear that Rahab must meet specific terms (spelled out in <a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18-20</a>).<p>&#8211; The wording guards against presumption. Just as Jesus later teaches in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a> that obedience proves genuine commitment, Rahab&#8217;s obedience will prove her faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by this oath</b><p>&#8211; Ancient oaths invoked God as witness&#8212;see <a href="/genesis/26-31.htm">Genesis 26:31</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16-17</a>. Breaking such an oath would invite divine judgment.<p>&#8211; Here, the spies emphasize &#8220;this oath&#8221; to single out the solemn promise they have just made (<a href="/joshua/2-14.htm">Joshua 2:14</a>). It is not a casual agreement; it stands before the Lord who commanded Israel not to misuse His name (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p>&#8211; The gravity of &#8220;this oath&#8221; anticipates the red cord scene (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>), a visible token akin to the Passover blood in <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>, marking those under protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you made us swear</b><p>&#8211; Rahab initiated the covenant request (<a href="/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12-13</a>). She &#8220;made&#8221; them swear in the sense of earnestly insisting, much like Abraham made his servant swear concerning Isaac&#8217;s marriage (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-3</a>).<p>&#8211; Her insistence springs from faith in Yahweh&#8217;s supremacy (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). She knows Jericho&#8217;s walls cannot save her; only Israel&#8217;s God can.<p>&#8211; By reminding Rahab that she &#8220;made&#8221; them swear, the spies underline her accountability. Her future obedience&#8212;gathering family inside, keeping silent (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18-20</a>)&#8212;will ratify the oath&#8217;s validity.<p>&#8211; Rahab&#8217;s active role illustrates that faith involves decisive action aligned with God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/2-17.htm">Joshua 2:17</a> teaches that the saving promise extended to Rahab was real yet conditional. The spies, God&#8217;s representatives, acknowledge the seriousness of the oath but make its fulfillment contingent on Rahab&#8217;s ongoing obedience. The verse highlights the balance between God-given assurance and human responsibility, reinforcing the biblical pattern that genuine faith is proven by faithful action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We will be blameless.</span> Perhaps "we <span class="accented">would be</span> blameless," and therefore we make the conditions which follow.
