It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides leadership and direction. This is consistent with God's previous communications with Moses and now with Joshua, affirming Joshua's leadership.<p><b>Do not be afraid or discouraged.</b><br>This reassurance echoes God's earlier encouragement to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>. It is a common biblical exhortation, found in various contexts, such as God's words to Moses and later to the prophets. It underscores the importance of faith and trust in God's promises, especially after the initial defeat at Ai in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>.<p><b>Take the whole army with you,</b><br>This instruction contrasts with the previous attack on Ai, where only a portion of the army was sent (<a href="/joshua/7-3.htm">Joshua 7:3-4</a>). It highlights the need for complete obedience and reliance on God's strategy rather than human judgment. It also signifies a united effort of the Israelites under God's command.<p><b>and go up and attack Ai.</b><br>The command to "go up" reflects the geographical elevation of Ai, which was located in the hill country. The term "attack" indicates a direct military engagement, which was a common method of conquest in the ancient Near East. This reflects the continuation of the conquest of Canaan, as promised to Abraham.<p><b>See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai,</b><br>This phrase is a prophetic assurance of victory, emphasizing God's sovereignty and control over the outcome. It parallels God's promise to deliver the Canaanite kings into Israel's hands, as seen in <a href="/joshua/2-24.htm">Joshua 2:24</a> and later in <a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Christ.<p><b>his people, his city, and his land.</b><br>This comprehensive victory includes the king, the inhabitants, the city, and the territory, signifying total conquest and fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land. It reflects the ancient practice of herem, or devotion to destruction, which was part of God's judgment on the Canaanites.

Thus its first and last names agree. It is remarked that whereas Palestine is full of "Tels" with other names appended to them (as Tell-es Sultan, and some ten others near Jericho alone), the place called et-Tel by Bethel has no other appendage. It is not the heap of anything, but simply <span class= "ital">the heap, </span>to this day; and this fact, which is apparently without parallel, seems to fix the site of Ai at <span class= "ital">et-Tel. </span>(See Note on <a href="/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country.

"Treacherous Israelites are to be dreaded more than malicious Canaanites" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">Take all the people of wax with thee.</span> Not, as has been before stated, because 3,000 men were too few to take the city, for the capture of Jericho was a far greater marvel than that of Ai with this number of men. The true reason is indicated by Calvin, and is indeed suggested by the words "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed." It was to reassure the people, whose hearts had "melted and become as water." Sometimes God calls upon His people for a display of faith, as when He led them through the Jordan, or commanded them to compass Jericho seven days. But in days of despondency He compassionates their weakness and permits them to rely upon visible means of support (see also below, ver. 3). Matthew Henry thinks that a tacit rebuke is here administered to Joshua for sending so few men to Ai on the frowner occasion. He ought to have permitted all to have shared the toil and glory. <span class="cmt_word">I have given into thy hand.</span> The work, let man do his best, is God's after all. <span class="cmt_word">The king.</span> For the political condition of Palestine before the Israelitish invasion see Introduction. <span class="cmt_word">And his land.</span> As in the case of the early Germanic peoples, there was a certain portion of their land in the neigbourhood attached to each city which was used for agricultural purposes (see Introduction;
