The Israelites had neglected this practice during their 40 years in the wilderness (<a href="/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a>). This event marks a renewal of the covenant as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. Circumcision was a physical sign of spiritual commitment and obedience to God. It also set the Israelites apart from other nations, symbolizing purity and dedication to God&#8217;s laws.<p><b>they stayed there in the camp</b><br>The camp was located at Gilgal, near the Jordan River. Gilgal served as the Israelites' base of operations during the initial conquest of Canaan. The name "Gilgal" is associated with the Hebrew word for "rolling," as God declared He had "rolled away the reproach of Egypt" from them (<a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>). This location was significant as it was their first encampment in the Promised Land, symbolizing a new beginning and a place of spiritual renewal.<p><b>until they were healed</b><br>The healing period was necessary due to the physical nature of circumcision, which required time for recovery. This pause before engaging in battle against the Canaanites demonstrates reliance on God&#8217;s timing and provision. It also reflects a period of spiritual preparation and purification. The healing can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual restoration, aligning with themes of renewal and readiness to fulfill God&#8217;s promises. This act of obedience and the subsequent healing foreshadow the spiritual healing and renewal found in Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who succeeded Moses and led the people into the Promised Land.

Neglecting it would mean being &#8220;cut off&#8221; from the people (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By obeying at Gilgal, Israel publicly reaffirmed faith in God&#8217;s promises before entering combat in Canaan, echoing Abraham&#8217;s obedience before receiving the land promise (<a href="/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; The same pattern of covenant renewal before new stages of mission appears later when Israel reads the Law on Mount Ebal (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30&#8211;35</a>) and when Judah renews the covenant under Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they stayed there in the camp</b><p>&#8220;They stayed there in the camp&#8221; highlights God-given space for recovery and reflection.<p>&#8226; Israel paused in obedience, trusting God for protection while physically vulnerable&#8212;much as Jacob trusted the Lord after circumcising his household at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24&#8211;25</a>), though with different outcomes.<p>&#8226; This enforced downtime fostered meditation on God&#8217;s faithfulness, similar to how the people later camped at Mount Sinai to receive the Law (<a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, purposeful pauses&#8212;Sabbath rest, retreat, or communion&#8212;allow heart preparation before spiritual battles (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until they were healed</b><p>&#8220;Until they were healed&#8221; affirms God&#8217;s care for His covenant people even in their weakness.<p>&#8226; Physical healing completed their readiness; spiritual healing accompanied it, for soon &#8220;the reproach of Egypt&#8221; would be rolled away (<a href="/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern is consistent: He perfects and commissions only after restoring. Elijah rested and was fed before returning to service (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5&#8211;8</a>). The disciples waited in Jerusalem &#8220;until you are clothed with power from on high&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord never rushes His people past processes He deems necessary; suffering and recovery are woven into preparation for victory (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joshua/5-8.htm">Joshua 5:8</a> records Israel&#8217;s complete obedience to the covenant sign, their deliberate pause in the safety of God&#8217;s presence, and His gracious healing that equipped them for conquest. The verse reminds us that true readiness for God-given assignments involves submission to His commands, unhurried dependence on His protection, and patient acceptance of His timing for restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Till they were whole.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">till they revived</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-8.htm">2 Kings 8:8</a>. Objections have been raised (see Keil and Delitzsch <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) to the possibility of this circumcision taking place in one day. But it has been shown by calculation that between one-third and one-fourth of the people who remained had been circumcised already, and that therefore such an operation as this could be performed with the utmost ease in a very short time. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;</span> is used here again, since the people were still Gentiles until the rite of circumcision was performed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
