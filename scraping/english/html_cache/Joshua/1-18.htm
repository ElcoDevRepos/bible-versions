The Israelites had a history of rebellion, as seen in their wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-4</a>). This command emphasizes the need for unity and submission to God's appointed leader to ensure success in their mission.<p><b>and does not obey your words</b><br>Obedience to Joshua's words is equated with obedience to God's commands, as Joshua is God's chosen leader. This reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's word as a path to blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The authority given to Joshua is reminiscent of the authority given to Moses, highlighting continuity in God's leadership.<p><b>all that you command him</b><br>The comprehensive nature of this obedience is crucial. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon full adherence to God's law (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-28</a>). This also prefigures the New Testament call to obey all that Christ commands (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>will be put to death</b><br>This severe consequence for disobedience underscores the seriousness of the covenant and the need for holiness among God's people. It reflects the Old Testament principle of justice and the need to purge evil from the community (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). This foreshadows the ultimate judgment for sin, which is spiritual death, as addressed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>Above all, be strong and courageous!</b><br>This exhortation is a recurring theme in <a href="/joshua/1.htm">Joshua 1</a> (verses 6, 7, 9) and serves as a divine encouragement to Joshua. It emphasizes reliance on God's strength rather than human ability. This call to courage is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to stand firm in faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>).
