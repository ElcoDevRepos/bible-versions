Dusk, or twilight, was a significant time in ancient cultures, often associated with transitions and the closing of city gates for security. In biblical symbolism, dusk can represent a time of decision or change, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/24-63.htm">Genesis 24:63</a>, where Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening.<p><b>when the gate was about to close</b><br>City gates were crucial for protection and commerce in ancient times. Jericho, being a fortified city, would close its gates at night to prevent enemy entry and maintain security. This practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as <a href="/nehemiah/7-3.htm">Nehemiah 7:3</a>, where gates were shut and barred for protection. The closing of the gate signifies a moment of urgency and impending security.<p><b>the men went out</b><br>This refers to the spies sent by Joshua to scout Jericho. Their mission was to gather intelligence on the city's defenses and morale. The narrative of spies is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, where Moses sent spies into Canaan. The departure of the men at this time suggests a strategic move to avoid detection.<p><b>and I do not know which way they went</b><br>Rahab's statement is a deliberate act of misdirection to protect the spies. Her actions demonstrate her faith and allegiance to the God of Israel, as later affirmed in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a>, where Rahab is commended for her faith. This phrase highlights the theme of divine providence and protection over those who align with God's purposes.<p><b>Pursue them quickly</b><br>Rahab's urging to pursue the spies is part of her ruse to mislead the king's men. This reflects her quick thinking and resourcefulness. The urgency in her words underscores the tension and danger of the situation, as well as her commitment to aiding the spies.<p><b>and you may catch them!</b><br>This final phrase in Rahab's statement is intended to convince the pursuers of the possibility of success, further ensuring the spies' safety. It reflects the cultural context of honor and duty, where the king's men would be motivated to act swiftly. Rahab's actions here are pivotal in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel's conquest of Jericho, illustrating how God can use unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rahab.htm">Rahab</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman living in Jericho, known for her role in hiding the Israelite spies.

Each phrase underscores God&#8217;s meticulous control over circumstances, from dusk&#8217;s concealment to the gate&#8217;s closing, from the false lead given to the guards to the urgency of their futile pursuit. While Rahab&#8217;s methods are imperfect, her faith aligns her with Israel, and the Lord employs her actions to preserve His spies, setting the stage for Jericho&#8217;s fall and affirming that nothing&#8212;walls, gates, or human schemes&#8212;can thwart His covenant plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I wot not.</span> Much has Been said about Rahab's falsehood which is little to the point. The sacred historian simply narrates the fact, and makes no comment whatever upon it. But the fact that Rahab afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah, as the genealogy in St. Matthew informs us (though Knobel denies this, asserting that between Joshua and David there were more than three generations, forgetting that Boaz, when he married Ruth, was an old man, see <a href="/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>), shows that neither her falsehood nor her mode of life excited much disapprobation among the Jews. Nor need this surprise us. There is no need, with Keil, to repudiate energetically the assertion of Hauff that the author of this Book regarded Rahab's deception as not only allowable, but praiseworthy, any more than we need scruple to confess that Jael's base treachery met with the approval of Deborah and Barak. The tone of feeling in Jewish society in Rahab's day must have differed enormously in many respects from what obtains in our own time, in the light of the dispensation of the Spirit. We may take, as an instance of what that tone of feeling was, even before Israel had been corrupted by their sojourn in Egypt, the narrative in <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>. And we may be sure that in a Phoenician city the tone was many degrees lower still. Rahab, therefore, was no doubt absolutely ignorant that there was any sin, either in her mode of living or in the lie she told to save the men's lives. She acted from a twofold motive, and her course, both of thought and action, was a most surprising instance of faith and insight, in one brought up as she had been. She not only followed an instinct of humanity, at a time when human life was thought of little value, in preserving the lives of the men who had sought shelter under her roof, but she could discern in the wonderful successes of Israel the hand of a higher power than that of the gods whom she had been brought up to worship. In her subsequent conduct she betrayed an affection for her kindred somewhat uncommon in persons situated similarly to herself. And we may be sure, from the fact that she was chosen to be a "mother in Israel," that she forsook the sins of her country and her education as soon as she came within the range of a higher light (see <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>). From what has been said we may learn that, though Rahab's faith was "as a grain of mustard seed," her conduct showed that she possessed it; and in hers, as in every case, to walk by the light she had was a sure prelude to the possession of more. And as regards her departure from truth here, it must be shown, before she can be blamed, that she had any idea that truthfulness was a duty. Such a duty does not appear to have been clearly recognised until He who was Himself the truth came among men. "However the guilt of Rahab's falsehood may be extenuated, it seems best to admit nothing which may tend to explain it away. We are sure that God discriminated between what was good in her conduct and what was bad; rewarding the former, and pardoning the latter. Her views of the Divine law must have been exceedingly dim and contracted. A similar falsehood, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, however laudable the motive, would of course deserve a much heavier censure" (Matthew Henry).
