The summoning of the twelve men signifies a moment of preparation and organization. The number twelve is significant throughout the Bible, often representing completeness and the people of God, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and later the twelve apostles. This act of summoning indicates a formal and important task, emphasizing the unity and collective responsibility of the tribes.<p><b>he had appointed from the Israelites</b><br>Joshua's prior appointment of these men underscores the importance of planning and leadership. The selection process would have involved choosing men of integrity and standing within their tribes, reflecting the need for trustworthy representatives. This mirrors the earlier appointment of leaders by Moses, as seen in <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>, where capable men were chosen to help govern the people. It highlights the continuity of leadership and the importance of delegation in fulfilling God's commands.<p><b>one from each tribe</b><br>The representation of each tribe ensures that the entire nation is involved in the memorial act that follows. This inclusivity reinforces the unity of the nation as they enter the Promised Land. Each tribe's participation symbolizes their shared heritage and collective future. This act of choosing one man from each tribe also prefigures the unity of believers in Christ, as seen in the New Testament, where all are one in Him regardless of their background (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The twelve stones that these men will later carry serve as a physical reminder of God's faithfulness to all the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.

The Lord has just held back the Jordan so the priests could stand &#8220;firmly on dry ground&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). The miracle is still in progress; nothing about it is theoretical. Just as God previously parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>), He is now cutting a new path. The &#8220;so&#8221; tells us that what follows flows directly from God&#8217;s supernatural intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joshua</b><p>Joshua, Moses&#8217; successor, stands as God&#8217;s chosen leader (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5-6</a>). His name means &#8220;Yahweh is salvation,&#8221; and he consistently lives that out in active faith (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). In every command, he models submission to the Word, setting the tone for the entire nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summoned</b><p>Joshua calls, he does not coerce.
