The twelve stones represent the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing unity and collective memory. This act serves as a physical reminder of God's faithfulness and the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River.<p><b>in the middle of the Jordan,</b><br>The location in the middle of the Jordan River is significant as it marks the exact spot where the priests stood with the Ark of the Covenant. This emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event, as the river was at flood stage (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). The stones in the riverbed serve as a testament to God's power in stopping the waters, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground.<p><b>in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood.</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant symbolizes God's presence among His people. The priests standing in the river with the Ark signifies God's direct involvement in the crossing. This mirrors the crossing of the Red Sea, where God's presence led the Israelites to safety (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). The Ark's presence in the river underscores the importance of faith and obedience in experiencing God's miracles.<p><b>And the stones are there to this day.</b><br>This phrase indicates the enduring nature of the memorial. It serves as a lasting witness to future generations of the miraculous event. The phrase "to this day" suggests that the stones were still visible at the time of the writing, providing historical credibility. This enduring memorial is a call to remember and teach future generations about God's mighty works, similar to the Passover celebration (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites after Moses, tasked with leading them into the Promised Land.

The twelve submerged stones, forever linked to the tribes, the Ark, and the priests, certify the reality of the miracle and call every generation to remember that the living God brings His people safely through impossible barriers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan.</span> A great deal of ingenuity has been wasted over this passage. Kennicott would read <span class="accented">"from</span> the midst," instead of "<span class="accented">in</span> the midst;" but this purely conjectural emendation is contrary to the fact that these stones were to be set up where the priests bearing the ark stood, while the others were to be set up where the Israelites rested for the night. Again: it has been asked why stones should be placed as a memorial in the Jordan itself, where no man could see them. The answer is a simple one. They were not placed in the Jordan, but at some distance from its banks. They were placed where the priests stood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the <span class="accented">brink</span> of the Jordan ("juxta ripam," Jarchi), which at that time had overflowed its banks (<a href="/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). It is no reply to this to observe with the translator of Keil that the stones would by this interpretation be left high and dry for the greater part of the year, for this would be the very reason why that precise spot was fixed upon for a memorial. Nor does the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5da;</span> in the midst, constitute any valid objection to this interpretation, for the same word is used in <a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>, although two verses previously we are told that the priests stood at the brink of the swollen river with the soles of their feet just dipped in the water (see note there). Thus while the Vulgate translates "in medio Jordanis alveo," the LXX. renders more accurately by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. Thus Rosenmuller's objection to the two monuments, namely, that such monuments would never be placed in a rapidly flowing stream like the Jordan, vanishes; while, as Poole suggests, these stones might be heavier, and form even a more enduring memorial than that of the first resting place of the Israelites, constructed as it were of stones which were not beyond the power of one man to carry after all, it may be asked whether it is more probable that this passage is an insertion from another, and an irreconcilable account (Meyer, Knobel), or that it is a later gloss (Rosenmuller, Maurer, etc.), or that two monuments of so mighty and memorable a miracle should have been set up, one at the place where the priests stood, and the other where the Israelites rested after this wonderful interposition of God on their behalf. So Hengstenberg 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 203. The Syriac version only supports Rosenmuller's view. The LXX. and Vulgate render "twelve other stones." The supposition that the sacred historian gives all the commands of God to Joshua, and that therefore such parts of the narrative as are not contained in these commands are to be rejected, is refuted by a comparison, for instance, of <a href="/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7, 8</a>, with vers. 13, 17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joshua also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1506;&#1463;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;u&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3091.htm">Strong's 3091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joshua -- 'the LORD is salvation', Moses' successor, also the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1511;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">twelve</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;t&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
