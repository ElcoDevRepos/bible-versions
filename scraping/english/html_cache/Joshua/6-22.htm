Their mission was to gather intelligence on Jericho, a key city in the conquest of Canaan. The spies' successful mission was crucial for Israel's strategy. The act of sending spies shows Joshua's wisdom and military acumen, reflecting a pattern seen in <a href="/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a> when Moses sent spies into Canaan. This also highlights the continuity of leadership from Moses to Joshua.<p><b>&#8220;Go into the house of the prostitute</b><br>Rahab, identified as a prostitute, lived in Jericho.

Rahab's profession and her faith in the God of Israel (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>) contrast, showing God's grace and the inclusion of Gentiles in His plan. Her faith and actions are commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>, illustrating that faith is demonstrated through actions.<p><b>and bring out the woman and all who are with her</b><br>This command underscores the importance of keeping promises and the value of Rahab's faith and assistance.

Entering the &#8220;house of the prostitute,&#8221; they pull a family from destruction, demonstrating that salvation reaches into unlikely places. Finally, the fulfilled oath underscores that both God and His servants keep their promises.
