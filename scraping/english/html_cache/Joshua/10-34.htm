Lachish and Eglon were both significant Canaanite cities, strategically located in the Shephelah, a region of lowlands between the coastal plain and the Judean hills. The movement from Lachish to Eglon demonstrates Joshua's strategic military planning, as he aimed to prevent the Canaanite cities from regrouping and forming alliances. This movement also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>). The swift transition from one city to another underscores the urgency and divine mandate of the conquest.<p><b>and all Israel with him</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the unity and collective effort of the Israelite tribes under Joshua's leadership. This unity is crucial for the success of their military campaigns and reflects the communal nature of Israelite society. The involvement of "all Israel" signifies that the conquest was not just a task for Joshua but a collective mission for the entire nation, fulfilling the covenantal promise given to their forefathers (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It also highlights the importance of obedience and solidarity among the people in achieving God's purposes.<p><b>They laid siege to it and fought against it</b><br>The siege of Eglon is part of the broader narrative of the conquest of Canaan, where the Israelites systematically dismantle the existing Canaanite power structures. The act of laying siege indicates a well-organized military strategy, involving surrounding the city to cut off supplies and weaken its defenses. This method of warfare was common in the ancient Near East and required patience and persistence. The phrase "fought against it" suggests direct engagement in battle, reflecting the Israelites' reliance on both divine guidance and human effort. The conquest of Eglon, like other cities, is seen as an act of divine judgment against the Canaanites for their idolatry and wickedness, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God's justice and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel, successor to Moses, and a central figure in the conquest of Canaan.
