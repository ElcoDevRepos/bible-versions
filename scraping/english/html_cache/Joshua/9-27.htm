It reflects the swift implementation of the decision made by Joshua and the leaders of Israel.<p><b>he made them woodcutters and water carriers</b><br>The roles of woodcutters and water carriers were menial and servile, often assigned to the lowest social classes or to those who were subjugated. This reflects the Gibeonites' status as subjects under Israelite control. The tasks were essential for the daily functioning of the community, especially in religious practices, as wood was needed for sacrifices and water for purification rituals.<p><b>as they are to this day</b><br>This phrase suggests the enduring nature of the Gibeonites' roles, indicating that the arrangement persisted for a significant period. It underscores the long-term impact of the covenant and the faithfulness of Israel in upholding their agreements, even with those who had deceived them.<p><b>for the congregation of the LORD</b><br>The congregation refers to the assembly of the Israelites, the people chosen by God. The Gibeonites' service to the congregation implies their integration into the community, albeit in a subservient role. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's mercy and the inclusion of Gentiles into His plans.<p><b>and for the altar</b><br>The altar was central to Israelite worship, where sacrifices and offerings were made to God. The Gibeonites' service at the altar signifies their contribution to the religious life of Israel, despite their initial deception. It highlights the importance of the altar in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>at the place He would choose</b><br>This phrase refers to the future centralization of worship in a specific location chosen by God, which would later be Jerusalem. It points to the prophetic nature of God's plans and the eventual establishment of a permanent place of worship, foreshadowing the coming of Christ, who would fulfill the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who succeeded Moses and led the Israelites into the Promised Land.
