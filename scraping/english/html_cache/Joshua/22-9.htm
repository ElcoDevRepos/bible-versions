This decision was made during the time of Moses, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, when they requested this land due to its suitability for their livestock.

The departure from Shiloh marks a transition from a united military campaign to individual tribal settlements, highlighting the shift from conquest to inheritance.<p><b>to return to their own land of Gilead</b><br>Gilead refers to the region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain.
