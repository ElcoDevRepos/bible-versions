Joshua, as the leader, acts with the consensus and participation of the entire nation. This reflects the communal nature of sin and its consequences, as seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the story of Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16). The involvement of "all Israel" underscores the seriousness of the offense and the need for communal purification.<p><b>took Achan son of Zerah</b><br>Achan's identification as the "son of Zerah" places him within the tribe of Judah, which is significant given Judah's future prominence in Israel's history. This connection to Judah foreshadows the tribe's importance, as it is from Judah that King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>). Achan's sin is a stark contrast to the future righteousness expected from this tribe.<p><b>the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold</b><br>These items were part of the devoted things that Achan took from Jericho, which were supposed to be consecrated to the Lord (<a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>). The specific mention of these items emphasizes the gravity of Achan's transgression. The silver, cloak, and gold symbolize material temptation and the lure of wealth, which is a recurring theme in Scripture (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). This act of taking what was devoted to God is a direct violation of the covenant and reflects the broader biblical theme of the dangers of covetousness.<p><b>his sons and daughters</b><br>The inclusion of Achan's family in the punishment reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of corporate identity and familial responsibility. This concept is seen in other biblical narratives, such as the punishment of Korah's family (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32-33</a>). It underscores the idea that sin can have far-reaching consequences beyond the individual, affecting entire families and communities.<p><b>his oxen and donkeys and sheep</b><br>The mention of Achan's livestock indicates the totality of the judgment against him. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, livestock represented wealth and livelihood. The destruction of Achan's possessions serves as a complete eradication of his legacy and a warning to the community about the seriousness of disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>his tent, and everything else he owned</b><br>The tent represents Achan's dwelling and personal space, symbolizing his life and identity. The comprehensive nature of the punishment, including "everything else he owned," signifies the totality of the judgment and the need for complete removal of sin from the community. This mirrors the biblical principle of purging evil from among the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p><b>and brought them to the Valley of Achor</b><br>The Valley of Achor, meaning "trouble," becomes a significant location in Israel's history. It is a place of judgment and serves as a physical reminder of the consequences of sin. However, in a prophetic sense, the Valley of Achor is later mentioned in <a href="/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a> as a "door of hope," symbolizing redemption and restoration. This duality reflects the biblical theme of judgment leading to eventual hope and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, tasked with leading the Israelites into the Promised Land.

For any other sin but this, Achan must have suffered alone. "The children shall not be put to death for the fathers." But in this case, warning had been given that the man who took of the accursed thing, or <span class= "ital">ch</span>e<span class= "ital">rern, </span>would be an accursed thing like it, if he brought it into his house (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-26.htm" title="Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>), and would make the camp of Israel <span class= "ital">cherem </span>also (<a href="/joshua/6-18.htm" title="And you, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.">Joshua 6:18</a>), and thus Achan's whole establishment was destroyed as though it had become part of Jericho. It is not necessary to assert that the family of Achan were accomplices. His cattle were not so, and yet they were destroyed. See also <a href="/1_chronicles/2-7.htm" title="And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the thing accursed.">1Chronicles 2:7</a>, where his line is not continued. Observe also the incidental reference to the fact in <a href="/joshua/22-20.htm" title="Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.">Joshua 22:20</a>, "<span class= "ital">That man perished not alone </span>in his iniquity." The severity of the punishment must be estimated by the relation of Achan's crime to the whole plan of the conquest of Canaan. If the destruction of the Canaanites was indeed the execution of the Divine vengeance, it must be kept entirely clear of all baser motives, lest men should say that Jehovah gave His people licence to deal with the Canaanites as it seemed best for themselves. The punishment of Saul for taking the spoil of Amalek (1 Samuel 15), and the repeated statement of the Book of Esther that the Jews who stood for their lives and slew their enemies, the supporters of Haman's project, <span class= "ital">laid not their hands on the prey, </span>are further illustrations of the same principle. The gratification of human passions may not be mingled with the execution of the vengeance of God. (See <a href="/esther/8-11.htm" title="Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,">Esther 8:11</a>; <a href="/esther/9-10.htm" title="The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.">Esther 9:10</a>; <a href="/context/esther/9-15.htm" title="For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.">Esther 9:15-16</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joshua/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Took Achan, the son of Zerah.</span> Great-grandson in reality (see ver. 1; cf. <a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And his sons and his daughters</span> (see note, ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Brought them</span>.
