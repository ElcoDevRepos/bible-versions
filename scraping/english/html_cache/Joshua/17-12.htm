This phrase highlights their struggle to fully possess their inheritance. Historically, the inability to occupy these cities reflects the challenges faced by the Israelites in driving out the existing Canaanite inhabitants. This struggle is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives, illustrating the incomplete obedience to God's command to fully possess the land (<a href="/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55-56</a>). The cities in question were likely fortified, making them difficult to conquer without divine intervention or complete unity and effort from the Israelites.<p><b>because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land</b><br>The Canaanites' determination to remain in the land underscores their resilience and the strength of their fortified cities. Culturally, the Canaanites were deeply rooted in the land, with established cities and religious practices that were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. This determination can be seen as a test of faith and obedience for the Israelites, who were commanded to remove the Canaanite influence to prevent idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). The persistence of the Canaanites also foreshadows future conflicts and the spiritual and moral challenges Israel would face, as seen in the Book of Judges. This situation typifies the ongoing spiritual battle between God's people and the influences of the world, pointing to the need for reliance on God's strength and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_manasseh.htm">Descendants of Manasseh</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, named after Manasseh, the firstborn son of Joseph.
