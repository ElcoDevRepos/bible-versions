It marks the culmination of Joshua's leadership and the renewal of the covenant with the Israelites. The timing is significant as it follows Joshua's farewell address, emphasizing the urgency and solemnity of the commitment being made.<p><b>Joshua made a covenant for the people</b><br>Joshua, as the leader and successor of Moses, acts as a mediator between God and the Israelites. The making of a covenant is a formal agreement, often involving promises and obligations. This covenant renews the commitment of the Israelites to serve the Lord exclusively, echoing the covenant made at Mount Sinai. It underscores the continuity of God's promises and the people's responsibilities.<p><b>and there at Shechem</b><br>Shechem is a significant location in biblical history. It is where God first promised the land to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>) and where Jacob settled and built an altar (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18-20</a>). The choice of Shechem for this covenant renewal is symbolic, connecting the past promises to the present commitment. Archaeologically, Shechem was a central city in the hill country of Ephraim, making it an accessible and meaningful site for the gathering of the tribes.<p><b>he established for them a statute and ordinance</b><br>The terms "statute" and "ordinance" refer to the laws and decrees that the Israelites are to follow. This phrase emphasizes the legal and binding nature of the covenant. It reflects the structure of ancient Near Eastern treaties, where stipulations and consequences were clearly outlined. The establishment of these laws at Shechem serves as a reminder of the covenant's seriousness and the need for obedience to God's commands. This act also prefigures the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and offers a new way of relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The leader of Israel after Moses, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.

Earlier, Israel had pledged, &#8220;We will obey the voice of the LORD&#8221; at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7&#8211;8</a>). Now Joshua, acting as leader and mediator, renews that same allegiance.<p>&#8226; Covenant renewals recur throughout Scripture&#8212;Josiah in <a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3</a>, Ezra&#8211;Nehemiah in <a href="/nehemiah/9-38.htm">Nehemiah 9:38</a>.<p>&#8226; Each renewal calls God&#8217;s people to remember His faithfulness and reject competing loyalties (see <a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, Christ is &#8220;Mediator of a new covenant&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>), fulfilled in His blood yet still demanding wholehearted obedience (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there at Shechem</b><p>Shechem is not a random backdrop; it is loaded with redemptive history.<p>&#8226; Abraham first received the promise here: &#8220;To your offspring I will give this land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob buried foreign gods under the oak at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>), prefiguring Israel&#8217;s present rejection of idols (<a href="/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua had earlier built an altar on nearby Mount Ebal and read &#8220;all the words of the Law&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30&#8211;35</a>).<p>By choosing Shechem, Joshua ties the people&#8217;s vow to the original promise to Abraham and to their recent conquest of the land.

The word used for covenant<span class="accented">, berith</span>, is derived from another word having the same meaning. This appears more probable than the suggestion of some, that the <span class="accented">berith</span> is derived from the practice of ratifying an agreement by a social meal. <span class="cmt_word">And set them a statute and ordinance.</span> Or, <span class="accented">appointed them a statute and a judgment.</span> The word translated "statute" is derived from the same root as our word <span class="accented">hack</span>, signifying to <span class="accented">cut</span>, and hence to engrave in indelible characters. The practice of engraving inscriptions, proclamations, and the like, on tablets was extremely common in the East. We have instances of it in the two tables of the law, and in the copy of the law engraven in stones on Mount Ebal. The Moabite stone is another instance. And the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian monarchs seem to have written much of their history in this way (see note on Joshua 8:32). The word rendered "ordinance" is far more frequently rendered "judgment" in our version, and seems to have the original signification of a thing set upright, as a pillar on a secure foundation. <span class="cmt_word">In Shechem</span> (see note on ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joshua/24-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
