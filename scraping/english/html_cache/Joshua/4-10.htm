The Ark, containing the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and manna, represents God's covenant and guidance. Standing in the Jordan signifies God's direct intervention in Israel's journey, reminiscent of the Red Sea crossing (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). The Jordan River, a significant geographical boundary, marks the transition from wilderness wandering to entering the Promised Land.<p><b>until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. Joshua, as Moses' successor, is tasked with leading the people according to divine instructions. The completion of these commands reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and the necessity of following divine guidance for success. This obedience is a recurring theme in Israel's history, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>just as Moses had directed Joshua</b><br>This highlights the continuity of leadership and the passing of divine authority from Moses to Joshua. Moses, the great lawgiver and leader, had prepared Joshua for this role (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7-8</a>). The phrase indicates that Joshua's leadership is a continuation of Moses' mission, ensuring that God's plans for Israel are carried out. It also reflects the importance of mentorship and preparation in leadership within the biblical narrative.<p><b>The people hurried across</b><br>The urgency in crossing the Jordan suggests a combination of eagerness and reverence. The people are eager to enter the Promised Land, a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The hurried crossing also reflects the miraculous nature of the event, as the waters are held back by God's power. This moment is a testament to God's faithfulness and the people's trust in His provision, paralleling the urgency seen in other biblical deliverances, such as the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons

href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/7-89.htm">Numbers 7:89</a>).<p>- God ordained the priests&#8212;set apart for holy service&#8212;to bear this sacred object (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>- Their role underscores that access to God must come through His appointed, consecrated means,

href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>).<p>- God literally piled up the waters (<a href="/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3&#8211;5</a>) so His people crossed safely&#8212;another Red Sea&#8211;type miracle (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>- By stationing themselves in the riverbed, the priests formed a living testimony that God holds back judgment (symbolized by floodwaters) until His covenant people are safe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until everything was completed</b><p>- They stood &#8220;until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded

carried out down to the last detail, revealing His demand for precise obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>- The miracle did not cease midway; God&#8217;s power stayed active until the task was finished, echoing Christ&#8217;s declaration, &#8220;It is finished&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), where Divine work is carried through to

pictures a literal, historical moment where consecrated priests, carrying God&#8217;s Ark, stand immovably in the Jordan&#8217;s dry bed until the entire nation crosses. Their steadfast presence, Moses-endorsed leadership, and the people&#8217;s swift passage all display complete obedience to the Lord&#8217;s word. The scene proclaims that when God commands, He also sustains; His appointed mediators hold back judgment, His promises remain unchanged, and His people must respond in urgent, trusting faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joshua/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">According to all that Moses commanded Joshua.</span>--It would seem that the passage of Jordan had been made the subject of some directions by Moses, though nothing is written concerning the manner of it in the Pentateuch.

While the people "hasted" to cross, either that they might effect the passage during the day, or, more probably, Because they crossed in fear and trembling, partly in spite of, and partly because of, the miraculous interposition on their behalf, the priests bearing the ark of God, the visible symbol of His presence, stood solemnly still at the brink of the river, nor did they stir until every one of that mighty host had passed over. Then, when all had safely crossed, the ark of God was borne across the bed of the river, and as soon as the soles of the priests touched the highest point that the waters had reached on the other side, they returned to their place, and all was as it had been before.
